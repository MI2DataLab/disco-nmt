one day , the Los Angeles Times , Steve <unk> , was listening to a wonderful piece of music in Los Angeles .
music is a man , an African @-@ American man , a very glamorous , passionate <unk> , with just a two strings of strings .
the story that I &apos;m going to tell you about right now is that a lot of you already know , because Steve &apos;s column turned out to be a basis for a book , and then Robert <unk> , who was a curator of <unk> <unk> , who had been a double van to get off of schizophrenia , and he had a horrible career out of schizophrenia .
Nathaniel &apos;s dropout , who had absolutely blown up 30 years after he painted on the streets of Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to look at Steve &apos;s book , or look at the movie , not only to understand the difference between these two men and women , but to look at music as a way of creating that kind of voice , and that is to change the most useful tool that will live in Nathaniel &apos;s life .
I met Mr. <unk> , and I met in 2008 , two years ago in the Disneyland halls .
and he listened to the first , the fourth symphony , which came to me .
he was happy , he was happy , he was talking about <unk> and Hillary , the Dodgers , and it was all due to the last act of Beethoven &apos;s <unk> in the fourth orchestra .
we talked about the music a few days later , and I received Steve letters to tell me that he was interested in doing something with me .
and what I should mention is that Nathaniel &apos;s treatment , because what he had learned was that the <unk> and the cracks were in his life forever .
and it turned out , his schizophrenia now became more likely , and the worst response was that he would have disappeared a couple of days on the streets on Skid Row , expose the fear of suffering and suffering on the streets on Skid Row .
Nathaniel was a state in which we started in the Disney Hall hall , and his eyes were <unk> , and he was a lost man .
he mentioned the devil and the smoke , and how someone could sleep when he slept .
I was scared , not for safety , but for fear , I was going to lose him , and I was going to ruin one of his states , and I would destroy his relationship with the violin , and if I started talking about the <unk> and the other magnificent forms of the scale .
so , I started <unk> .
I played the first <unk> by Beethoven <unk> .
when I was playing , I knew there was a difference in Nathaniel &apos;s eye .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s exposed to something that &apos;s invisible , it &apos;s like having a chemistry , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
his voice is calm , it &apos;s become quiet curiosity , it &apos;s lovely .
and the amazing thing is , he took his violin , and he began to perform some of the sessions with the <unk> <unk> , and he would come and do it again , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
so we started talking about music : from Bach to Beethoven , to <unk> , all the names of all the people that started in B all the way from being to <unk> .
I learned that he wasn &apos;t just a piece of music , but he was able to connect the music with his personal senses .
he was talking about things that were so passionate and deep understanding of music as I was talking to my colleague in Los Angeles .
by playing music , talking about music , and this man who was from a <unk> , a staunch Protestant , who was in the streets of Los Angeles , turned out to be a charming musician , educated music education .
music is medicine . music has changed us .
for him , music is about helping him open up .
because music can help him turn his mind into reality through his imagination and creativity .
and that &apos;s what helped him get out of his suffering .
and I know that &apos;s what art looks like .
and that &apos;s why we create music , and we use every one of us to have an internal core of our essence , our emotions through our artistic lens , through our creativity , to shape our emotional reality .
and the actual expression of reality gives us all the people touched us , enlighten us .
he took him back to a group of friends .
the power of the music is bringing him back to the next big family , where people understand the gift he had .
and I &apos;m going to make music for him , whether it &apos;s in the streets of Walt Disney or on the street , because he suggested to me why I was going to be a musician .
thank you .
<unk> : thank you . thank you .
Robert Full .
Robert Full : now I &apos;m just going to play a piece of music that I &apos;ve learned from the <unk> .
so please forgive me .
I &apos;ve had a lot of fish in my life .
only two are my favorites .
the first is passion .
it &apos;s a beautiful fish , beautiful texture , full of <unk> , the most popular fish on the menu .
what a beautiful fish !
and the better thing is that it &apos;s dependent on the highest standard fertility , which is to keep it sustainable .
and the people who sold him were feeling <unk> .
I used to think about this beautiful relationship , which was about a couple of months .
and one day , the top of this company called me invited me to join a campaign and sustainable development of fisheries .
I said , &quot; Of course you can do it . &quot;
and this is a company that is trying to figure out how we &apos;re going to be unthinkable at the end of our chef , how do we keep fish on the menu , on the menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been cutting trees in all the oceans .
it &apos;s never been a disruptive .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the big tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re all going to die .
almost nothing left .
so , whether it &apos;s good or bad , <unk> , <unk> , will be part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of talk about the industry , and they &apos;re mostly about frustration and they &apos;re about frustration and they &apos;re very cheap , like tuna . the biggest <unk> .
the feed of the tuna is 15 .
what that means is , every single pound of a tuna meat is going to take 15 pounds of feed from other wild fish .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
it &apos;s not about good taste .
and finally , this company wants to do the right thing .
I want to support them .
on the day of that campaign , I contacted the head of the PR organization .
let &apos;s call him Joe <unk> for a seven @-@ year @-@ old <unk> .
I said , don &apos;t know , don &apos;t know , don &apos;t make a clear Don Quixote , but I know , you &apos;re famous in the ocean , and you &apos;re not going to contaminate your <unk> .
he responded : the right thing to say . we &apos;re far away from our work , and the pollutants that we &apos;re all being made are diluting , don &apos;t keep in a place .
and he goes to the pen , and we &apos;re like a <unk> .
feed the feed ? two and a half . he said yes .
the best in the <unk> industry .
two and a half times better than one .
what is two and a half ? what are you looking for ? what are you doing ?
he said , &quot; <unk> for <unk> protein .
I said , &quot; <unk> is good . hang on the phone .
and as a result , I was lying in bed and I was thinking , what is the recipe for sustainability ?
so the next day , before that incident , I called <unk> .
I said , &quot; Don &apos;t , for example , have you some examples of sustainable protein ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would go and ask the people around .
and then I had a few phone calls from this company , but no one could give me a clear answer , until finally , the call was an expert in biology .
let me tell you , don &apos;t tell him to cut his legs down .
I said , well , don &apos;t you want to have a cut that &apos;s going to work , or can you use a green protein ? <unk> .
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and he said the following .
I said , &quot; <unk> ? <unk> ?
he said , &quot; <unk> is feather , <unk> , bone , dry , dry @-@ dry , <unk> @-@ dry , <unk> @-@ <unk> .
I said , what percentage of the chicken is in the feed of the chicken ?
think about it , you know , two percent .
and he said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent . that &apos;s about 30 percent .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t Don &apos;t cut , come on , this is a real sustainable <unk> ? come on .
there was silence over a long period of time , and he said to me , &quot; The chicken is so much chicken out there . &quot;
so I stopped loving this fish .
no , not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous , <unk> .
I actually do .
no , I don &apos;t love this fish anymore , because I swear to God that after that talk , that chicken sounded more like a chicken .
the second fish , it &apos;s a different story .
it &apos;s a very romantic , and the more you understand your fish , the more you love it .
I first ate this fish in a restaurant , in southern Spain .
a long time ago , a journalist and I said here .
she could say it was a <unk> .
that fish is light on the table with a light , white light .
the chef cooked time .
it &apos;s like cooking twice .
but it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s good .
who could make a flower like that , and could it be in cooking time ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him <unk> . his name is <unk> .
but he didn &apos;t cook that fish , he wasn &apos;t a chef , at least in the way that you understand it .
he was a biologist <unk> <unk> .
he &apos;s a <unk> in Spain .
he &apos;s on the cusp of the tall <unk> river .
and it wasn &apos;t until the late 1980s , it was a cooperative of people in Argentina .
they were there at that time , and it was basically wetlands .
they had the water out .
they then build a series of complicated Gowanus Canal , where they put the water on the river .
but they didn &apos;t succeed , I mean economics .
and it &apos;s a tremendous disaster around the environment .
almost 90 percent of the birds around the world are gone , and in this area are a lot of birds .
in &apos; 92 , a Spanish company with environmental awareness bought this piece .
what did they do ?
they <unk> the direction .
they &apos;re basically <unk> .
instead of doing the <unk> , they used the <unk> to bring water back .
they fill the water .
and then a <unk> colony -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- in this project , <unk> <unk> , and this company , has completely saved this expedition .
it was amazing .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
I looked at the horizon as a kind of vast , into your view , the canal from the water and the fertility of this magnificent <unk> .
not too long ago , I was there with <unk> .
he was a remarkable man , and he was a Darwinian , a quarter of a crocodile .
we went into the wetlands , and I was <unk> , and I was <unk> in the water , and I was <unk> in the pots of life , and the <unk> of the <unk> River .
and here , he pointed to a rare , black shoulder <unk> .
this is what he referred to as the <unk> plankton .
and this , he saw a series of patterns that allow people to go to the <unk> Valley of Tanzania .
as a result , <unk> had spent a long time working in the national parks in Africa .
I asked him how he became a fish scientist .
he said , &quot; <unk> fish ? I don &apos;t know them .
I &apos;m just an expert on the <unk> .
and he started talking about rare birds and algae and different <unk> .
don &apos;t get me wrong , and that conversation really is about the kind of thing , the <unk> .
it &apos;s good , but I &apos;m in love .
there was always a <unk> in my head that I &apos;d learned how to cook with over @-@ over @-@ over @-@ over fish .
so I quit him . I said , &quot; Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah , blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
he pointed to the algae .
and I know , the brothers , the algae , the oxygen , the whole thing is amazing .
but what does your fish eat ?
what is the feed of the feed ? <unk> ?
and he kept telling me that this is a very productive system that these fish are eating in the wild .
plant biomass , phytoplankton , plankton , phytoplankton , feed fish .
the system is very healthy , it &apos;s completely self @-@ updates .
no feed .
have you heard about a farm that doesn &apos;t feed the animals ?
and later that day , I was driving around with the minister , and I asked him , how does it look so natural that it doesn &apos;t look like any other farm that I &apos;d ever seen before , how do you measure success ?
at that time , it was as if there was a film director that suddenly required to change the scene .
we turn around and see the most beautiful picture , thousands of pink <unk> , so that &apos;s a pink carpet .
he said , &quot; <unk> is success . come on .
look at their abdominal down , pink .
they &apos;re enjoying their <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
the show ? I &apos;m completely blown away .
I said , <unk> <unk> , isn &apos;t it your fish ? is it your <unk> ?
and he said , &quot; He said .
birds will eat 20 percent of our fish and <unk> .
and , last year , this work has <unk> <unk> , over 250 different species .
today , it &apos;s been the largest and it &apos;s one of the largest privately owned birds in Europe .
I said , okay , so many birds , so many , don &apos;t they want to be the most <unk> ? don &apos;t they want it ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
he said , &quot; Let &apos;s invest in a general nurturing , not deliberate .
it &apos;s an ecological network .
these flamingos eaten shrimp .
shrimp farms .
so the more they have their stomach , the more the pink they have , the better the system is .
well , let &apos;s take a second . a farm does not feed the animals , and it &apos;s measuring its success based on its predators .
a <unk> , and it &apos;s also a <unk> .
and , by the way , those <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t be there .
they breed in the town , and they &apos;re outside 150 miles away , and the soil is much more potent .
every morning , they fly 150 miles to the camp .
and at night , they fly 150 miles home .
they did it because they could follow the white line on the Champs @-@ Elysees .
no fun .
I &apos;ve always imagined the &quot; <unk> &quot; in my head , and I watch the <unk> .
I said , well , <unk> , they fly 150 miles to <unk> , and they fly 150 miles at night ?
do they do that for kids ? do they do that .
he was looking at me like I had just spoken out of Houston songs .
he said , &quot; No , no , they do this because it &apos;s better here . better . &quot;
I &apos;m not talking about my favorite <unk> of fish , which is delicious , and I don &apos;t like soup . I don &apos;t normally like baking . I don &apos;t like to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s got <unk> , like tar .
I never did it with the fish .
but when I was in the southern part of Spain , it didn &apos;t taste like a <unk> .
it tasted <unk> and it was kind of like you &apos;d taste out of naturally .
and I mentioned to Tony , and he loved it .
he said , &quot; <unk> &apos;s role is like a sponge . &quot;
it &apos;s the final line that prevents anything from going into the body .
the role of it is to absorb the <unk> .
and he said , &quot; <unk> , but we don &apos;t have any water in our water .
okay . a fish is not white . a fishery is measuring its success is due to natural predators .
and I realized that when he said , a <unk> , he said that , because water flows through the high @-@ water river .
the river contains all of the chemicals in it now , chemical pollutants , streaming .
and when it goes into the system , the water will be better than the sound .
the system is very healthy , it can filter the water over here .
so , this work is not just about feeding animals , it &apos;s not just about measuring its success based on natural health , but it &apos;s about a fishery , and it &apos;s not just for you and me .
because when it leaves it , it comes into the Atlantic Ocean .
I know it &apos;s a very good thing , but I &apos;m very interested in it , and you should be , because it &apos;s a love story , it &apos;s not just romance , it &apos;s education .
you might say it &apos;s the future food diet , whether we &apos;re talking about beef cattle or beef .
what we need now is a whole new agriculture concept , a real food .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s extreme .
we &apos;re not a realist , we &apos;re a <unk> . we are love .
we love the market . we love small food farm . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and then when you suggest that the food that will make the future , and someone stands up and says , &quot; My gosh , I love the pink flamingos , but how do you get the world to fill up ?
how do you feed the world ? &quot;
can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like your problem .
no , it &apos;s not just because we &apos;ve grown far more than we need in the world .
a billion people are still in a hurry today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever -- the fundamental law is the distribution of inequality , not the sum of the nations .
and the real reason I don &apos;t like this is because he put up a food system that was in the last 50 years .
bring the grain to the <unk> , bring the chemicals to the soil , pump it for the fish , and agriculture can be simple questions , asking if we can feed more people , what &apos;s wrong with it ?
it &apos;s an incentive . it &apos;s been replicated , and it &apos;s a business plan for American agriculture .
we need to point out its true reality , a consumer business , a rapidly <unk> , an ecological capital that makes it possible .
it &apos;s not a business , it &apos;s not agriculture .
our food today is threatened , not because it &apos;s in the supply chain , but because of the available resources .
it &apos;s not the invention of the latest <unk> technology , it &apos;s the <unk> soil , it &apos;s not the pump , it &apos;s the fresh water , not the <unk> , the forest , not the fishing and the nets , but the fish in the ocean .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start asking : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we build a environment that will feed every single group ?
to do that , don &apos;t expect the future for agriculture models .
it &apos;s obsolete , and it &apos;s tired .
it &apos;s dependent on excess capital , chemical , mechanical , and it &apos;s not making good foods .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s been around for two billion years at the same time .
look at the <unk> , look at farmers like this .
it &apos;s not just about their farm , it &apos;s self @-@ fulfilling , it &apos;s not about consumption , it &apos;s not about the farm , it &apos;s not about the special farm , it &apos;s not just about the manufacturer of the farmer , it &apos;s the experts .
because they &apos;re also experts in taste .
and if I want to be honest , they &apos;re better than I am .
you know , I absolutely do agree with this because if good food in the future is so good , it must be delicious .
thank you .
if I want to leave you with one idea today that all of the data that we consume are rich enough to be greater than the sum of the parts , which is that all of the data that we consume is very rich in the sum of all the data that we consume is much more information than the data that we &apos;re consuming , and instead of thinking about it .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death graph , based on age .
the tools I use here are a little experiment .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I can filter it for specific reasons , like an accident .
immediately , I saw a different pattern .
it &apos;s because , in the middle , people are here at the height of their most active times , and they &apos;re the most <unk> of their life .
we can reconstruct the data by dying , and we can see that the recycling disease and cancer are the major conditions , but it doesn &apos;t work for everybody .
if we filter it down at 40 years , we can see that the crash is highly saturated for people .
if you dig it further , it turns out it &apos;s a particular male effect .
well , you might understand the role of this instrument to fly through this kind of information that data is very much like living data .
and if we can do that , why don &apos;t we do it on the content ?
so we &apos;re showing here every issue that has ever been done .
all over here , all on the Web .
you can go back to your room after I finished .
with shovels , you can check for 10 years .
you can go into a year .
you can go directly into one issue .
for example , I saw this ; I saw the old athlete here on earth .
I &apos;m a fan of Lance Armstrong , so I &apos;m going to click on it and I &apos;m just going to show you all of these puzzles that are just part of Lance Armstrong &apos;s problems .
now , if I just wanted to sample these data points , I would think , well , look at all the bikes ?
so I can step back and scale this up .
I saw Greg <unk> .
so you have to understand that when you go through the narrow , narrow , <unk> , backwards , you &apos;re not looking for it , not looking .
what you &apos;re doing is actually slightly different .
in between , and we think this has changed the way information is used .
so , I came up with something that was sort of crazy about this idea .
what we &apos;re doing here is we &apos;re going to just divide every Wikipedia page and then we &apos;re going to have a little <unk> .
the <unk> account contains a map of what &apos;s emerging from the field .
I &apos;m just showing you the top 500 popular Wikipedia pages .
but even in these limited browsing , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we learned what is the most popular thing in Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to move and choose the government .
now , through the following government , I can see that most of the usual suspects in Wikipedia are the Time <unk> .
it &apos;s important because it &apos;s not a content of any WikiLeaks web .
it &apos;s only when you step back and look at the big picture that you might see .
look at one of these particular <unk> , and then I can go into the Time magazine and get them .
so , if you look at these guys , I can see a lot of them from government . there &apos;s a part of science , fewer sections from business , and there &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , the Nobel Prize for TED Prize .
so we can continue , and look at all the grand grand grand grand grand grand grand prize of TED .
so you see , this is the first time we &apos;re moving around the Internet and it &apos;s not just a page , but it &apos;s a much bigger one .
so I want to tell you about something else that might surprise you .
I &apos;m just showing you the New York Times website .
<unk> , the app -- I don &apos;t want to call it the browser , but it &apos;s actually a browser that you can browse the pages -- and we can bring it back to every website like this , and we can bring it back up to the <unk> and we can bring it back to every website like this .
so I can step back and step back in a particular place .
why this is important is because , in this case , I can look at all my history through this medium .
so I could go all the time .
here , in fact , is what I just showed you .
I can see something that I saw earlier today .
if I want to step back and take a step back , I can cut my history , maybe my search history , and here &apos;s some search , search , check , check , check , check , check , check out for the Microsoft <unk> .
and from that , I can go into the Web and just Google them .
it &apos;s the same information , because it &apos;s mesh @-@ enabled , <unk> , <unk> it , <unk> it , every time it becomes more relevant than the sum of its parts , every time it becomes more relevant than the sum of the overall information .
now , in the world , we talk about data often about the curse .
we talk about the explosion of information .
we &apos;re talking about being in the ocean .
suppose we can turn the web over and over and over and over again , and in contrast to the original information , let &apos;s start to hate information , to link information , to see the hidden patterns , to see the hidden patterns , to see the hidden patterns , to see the hidden patterns that we can &apos;t see in this way ?
if we can do that , instead of being stuck in the data , we can actually access information .
and not just processing information , we can tease out knowledge .
if we gain knowledge , we can even find intelligence .
thank you .
I grew up with science fiction .
at high school , I was going to take an hour and get back to school every day .
I &apos;ve always been immersed in the long @-@ standing book , science fiction brought my mind to other worlds , and in narrative terms , I was very curious .
in addition to that , I &apos;m also curious to show you all the time when I don &apos;t need to go to the trees , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the research underneath the microscope .
I was like , you know , a science <unk> .
but it &apos;s all about trying to understand the world , understanding the boundaries of possibility .
and my love of science fiction was also related to the world around me , because it was the late &apos; 60s , and humans began to dive into the deep sea .
Jacques <unk> , put his magic special visual special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special special
it seems like science fiction is all about it .
at the same time , I was an artist .
I can draw a picture .
I also found that because there was no video games , special effects , movie and mass media that I had to create these images in my head .
and I believe that when you &apos;re a kid , when you &apos;re a kid , it &apos;s often the same thing that the author in our brains described .
and my response to that is to portray extraterrestrial biological , alien , robot , spacecraft , etc .
I was stuck behind the textbook and graffiti can always be <unk> .
and as a result , I had to ask other ways to pursue my creativity .
interestingly , the Jacques <unk> film struck me that there was a alien world on Earth .
I may not have been able to actually go to the alien world in my lifetime . it sounds too late .
but there &apos;s actually a world that I can go to that world -- the <unk> and the <unk> that I have with my books .
so in the year of my 15 year , I decided to become a aquanauts .
but the only problem was , I was living in a small village in Canada , and the sea was going to be 600 miles away .
but I didn &apos;t do it .
and I kept my father over and over , until he found a dive in New York City , and it landed on the other side of the Champs @-@ Elysees .
and so I got my dive license in the swimming pool , in the swimming pool of water .
but in the next two years , I witnessed the sea , until we moved to California .
for the next 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours in the submersible .
I found in the deep ocean -- even the shallow water -- it &apos;s amazing life , far beyond our imagination .
it &apos;s not nearly as much as our imagination as nature &apos;s imagination .
until today , everything that I &apos;d seen in me was amazing .
my love of the ocean is neither going to change .
but when I was tired , I chose to make movies .
and it seemed to me that this was the best way to combine my storytelling to create images .
when I was a kid , I used to draw comics .
and the movie made exactly the image and the story , which , of course , will happen .
and of course , the story I was talking about was a science fiction story called &quot; The <unk> &quot; and &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; The Bottom Billion &quot; I combine my love and filmmaking into deep and diving .
divide two passions , combine them .
and the idea of &quot; The Bottom Billion &quot; is this : in a better visual mode , we &apos;re beginning to use animation technology .
the first synthetic character in the <unk> was born .
and even though that <unk> , it happened to be back in time , I saw an amazing scene -- the magic that the global audiences were represented in .
and that &apos;s what Arthur C. Clarke -- which is difficult to distinguish between advanced technology and magic .
and what the audience saw was that magic .
I was so excited .
and I was thinking , God , this technology was going to have to go all the way across the scale of the film .
so in my next movie , &quot; The Terminator 2 , &quot; we pushed this technology to the new stairs .
by working with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , we created the liquid metal from the film , and the success of the movie depends on whether this technology works .
it worked . we created the magic again , and we got the same feedback from the audience , but the movie office was a little better .
and with that twice , we realized it would be a new world to allow the artistic imagination to play a whole new world .
so I started a company with my friend , <unk> <unk> , who was the name of the <unk> and <unk> , and the name of the company was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
and the idea of the company is to develop these artifacts , and so on , go straight into digital .
in fact , we did . we took the leap of faith .
but in the &apos; 90s , we found that while the business was designed in biology , human @-@ character design , we had a problem .
so I created this piece called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which are trying to push the limit of the visual impact , using computer animation to make real human emotions , and the main character is made from the computer .
but I touched the equation , and the people in our business told me that we were not going to be able to do this kind of special effects .
so I put this idea together and moved to a film about the ocean floor .
I was talking to the movie at the time that the film company was going to be the top of the boat and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a beautiful , romantic film .
but my real motive was to go and visit the Titanic .
that &apos;s why I make the movie .
I mean , the truth is , but the movie was not seen .
I persuaded them . I said , &quot; Look , we &apos;re going to go into the field , we &apos;re going to go out there .
it &apos;s the start of the movie .
it &apos;s very important , very theater .
so I convinced them to invest in an adventure .
it sounds crazy . but at the end of the day , it &apos;s still about creating a reality if you use your imagination .
in fact , we did create a reality after six months -- I was underwater underwater at 2.5 miles in a Russian submersible , in a view of the Titanic .
it &apos;s not a movie , it &apos;s not a high @-@ definition , it &apos;s a realization .
and that was pretty amazing to me .
the early days were very flexible , we needed to build cameras , lights , whatever .
but what really struck me was that these deep dives , like the universe .
both of them are high @-@ tech products , and they both have to be popular .
you &apos;re dark , you &apos;re dark , you &apos;re deep in this dark environment , and if you can &apos;t rely on your own power , you &apos;re not supposed to be possible by any rescue .
I thought about it : my God . I was like I was in a science paper .
that &apos;s cool . that &apos;s cool .
and so , the deep sea exploration became my new passion .
of course , this is due to the curiosity , the science , the whole thing , to seek out the unknown , to curiosity , to imagination .
Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me a rare experience .
I can imagine a creature , and I can use computer special special special effects to create it , but I can &apos;t imagine all the things that I saw that day .
in the course of our expedition , I looked at the hydrothermal vent , and sometimes I would see something that I &apos;d never seen before , and sometimes I &apos;d never seen anything that anyone had never seen before , even something that we &apos;d never seen before , before , even before , was recorded before .
and so I was <unk> all the time , and I had to go .
so I made a very surprising decision .
and after the Titanic was successful , I decided , okay , I was working in Hollywood to make movies , and over the course of the course , I was going to become a explorers .
so we started to plan these expeditions .
we went to the <unk> , we used the robotic device to detect the floor .
we then went back to the Titanic .
and it &apos;s created a series of robots that can contain sound fibers .
the goal was to get inside the wreckage and explore inside the inside of it -- an unprecedented act .
before , no one had ever looked at the floor . they didn &apos;t have the technology needed , so we created the appropriate technology .
you know , I was on the cusp of the Titanic , sitting in a submersible , looking at the top of this wooden ship , trying to be on the top of the show .
I &apos;m manipulating a little robot that flies over the corridors of the <unk> corridors .
while I &apos;m manipulating it , my thoughts are in this quest .
I felt that I was in the actual pieces of Titanic .
it was the most incredible feeling that I &apos;d ever met , and that was because I &apos;d spent a lot of months trying to light up the light around the robot , and I &apos;d already know everything that was hidden in the corner , because in the process of making films , I &apos;d spent a lot of months in this scene .
and the sequence of the studio in the studio was created by a real model of the ship .
so that experience was extraordinary .
it allowed me to experience a telepresence experience -- we even have the physical form of these robots , and we embed them into a different form .
it &apos;s a profound feeling .
it might make us think about what the world will look like after a few decades , and as a science community , I can imagine the future of human society , using half and a half @-@ dozen other activities .
so through these expeditions , I began to really appreciate the beauty of the ocean floor , such as creatures that live in the deep ocean , they &apos;re kind of extraterrestrial life .
they live in a chemical <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t require light that we depend on .
so when you look at the animals living at 500 degrees below the surface .
you think they &apos;re completely impossible .
and at the same time , I was interested in the space technology , and it was also the effects of science fiction .
and as a result , I worked closely with the space community , working with the U.S. Capitol , and became one of the agencies of the National Security Council , the actual manned space mission , to go to Russia , to see a series of <unk> documents , so that we took our 3D space to the International Space Station .
it &apos;s a very memorable experience .
but what I ended up doing was trying to convince the space scientists to go to the deep ocean .
let them experience firsthand . space biologists , astrophysics , etc . , etc . , where the people who were interested in extreme environments were brought to the deep ocean to allow them to see , to take a look , to see , to take a look , to see and so on .
so what we &apos;re doing at the same time is studying the <unk> of science .
I &apos;ve been connected as a science fiction experience and reality as a child .
I learned a lot about this voyage .
I learned a lot about science , but I learned a lot about leadership .
you think that the director must be a leader , the leadership , the <unk> .
but before these expeditions , I knew nothing about leaders .
because I &apos;m always asking myself , what am I doing ?
why do I do this ? what do I get out of it ?
these damn documentaries don &apos;t make money .
we think it &apos;s not easy . it &apos;s not easy .
a lot of people think I &apos;m at the Titanic and the two films between the <unk> , sitting on the sand .
but in fact , I made these films , and there were very few of them .
<unk> , no money . what are you doing ?
I do all this for the value of the experience itself -- the most challenging environment in the ocean -- and I do this as a kind of amazing sense of discovery , as a group of people hit a very tight team .
because every time we &apos;re working with 10 or 12 people , we &apos;re going to spend a couple of years in the sea for two or three months .
and in that kind of cohesive period , you realize that the most important thing is you lived with them , a task that you cannot explain to other people .
when you go back to the shore , you say , well , we need to do this , the optical fibers , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the technique , the work of the work -- that you can &apos;t explain to other people -- it &apos;s almost impossible to explain to other people -- it &apos;s not the same as the police or the soldier .
creating a cohesion , creating a cohesive <unk> .
so when I came back to make my next movie &quot; <unk> , &quot; I tried to apply the same principles of leadership -- respect your group , and they &apos;re going to help you .
and this faith really changed the dynamic of the team .
I &apos;ve been working with a little group once again to make the unknown territory , to create new technologies that never existed .
exciting .
it &apos;s full of challenges .
in four and a half years , we became a big family .
this has completely changed the way I make films .
people were saying , &quot; Well , you take the sea and bring it back to people &apos;s vision and put it on the planet .
for me , the basic rules and processes have changed the outcomes .
so what do we get from this ?
what &apos;s learning ?
I think the first is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you have .
imagination is a power that reflects reality .
your team is going to be more important than all the other women in the world .
sometimes the young director would ask me : give me advice to some of the movies .
and my answer was : don &apos;t let yourself .
other people are going to be limiting you , but you don &apos;t control yourself , but you don &apos;t choose to lose your own weight . you &apos;re going to be risky .
the United States has an interesting maxim that they don &apos;t have an option .
but in art and exploration , failure must be an option , because it requires a challenge .
there is no such thing as an important struggle for innovation without a risk .
you have to take these risks .
and that &apos;s what I want to leave you with : whatever you do , failure is one of those options , but fear is not . thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate , which may seem surprising .
what I &apos;m going to talk about today is energy and climate , which is surprising , after all , my full @-@ time job at the foundation is about disease and agriculture , and that is really about us to disseminate , and to try to improve the lives of the poorest people in the world .
but in fact , energy and climate are important to these people , in fact , more important than others on Earth , but in fact , energy and climate are particularly important to these people , and in fact , more important than everybody else on Earth .
climate impacts mean that their crops will grow for years , and that means that they will continue to grow or drought , that means that their crops can &apos;t grow over the years , or drought , that these changes in vulnerable environments can &apos;t help them to thrive , and they can &apos;t afford to survive in vulnerable circumstances .
it &apos;s going to lead to famine , it &apos;s going to lead social riots .
so , climate change will bring them back to life , and at the same time it &apos;s critical for them .
so , climate change will bring them back to life , and at the same time it &apos;s critical for them .
in fact , if you can only reduce the price of something by reducing poverty , you will end up with , in fact , if you can only reduce the price of something as poor , you &apos;ll have a very good number .
civilization has been increasing over time , and it has been built on advanced energy .
civilization has been increasing over time , and it has been built on advanced energy .
the coal revolution that had propelled the revolution early 20th century , and that was the beginning of the turn of the millennium , and that was the reason that we could enjoy the outdoor air conditioning and fall in the early 20th century , and that was how we could enjoy the outdoor air , and we could have all kinds of things to do .
because of electricity , we can live in a rich world .
but when we &apos;re further down , for example , when we &apos;re trying to make it cost twice as cheap , we have a new limit to CO2 , and we have a new limit to CO2 , which is a limit to CO2 .
carbon dioxide is creating global warming , and computing emissions are actually emitting very simple CO2 into the global warming , and carbon dioxide is very simple .
the CO2 emissions today lead to tremendous increases in temperature , CO2 emissions up , rising temperatures , opening up a range of very serious consequences such as the effects of weather , or indirectly , in the ecosystem , the consequences of the effects of the effects of the effects of the ecosystem , the consequences of the effects of the effects of the effects of the ecosystem , or the consequences of the ecosystem .
what is the relationship between carbon dioxide emission and temperature ? why is the difference between the carbon dioxide emission rising and the temperature ? how is the difference between carbon dioxide rising and temperature ? what is the relationship between carbon dioxide rising and temperature ? what is the difference between carbon footprint ? what is the difference between carbon footprint ? it &apos;s not sure ?
how severe the negative effects of global warming are , it can &apos;t be quite sure , but certainly how severe the negative consequences of global warming are , it can &apos;t be quite sure , but it &apos;s certainly extremely serious .
I &apos;ve spent a lot of time with the best scientists : do we really have to get the CO2 emissions down to zero ? I &apos;ve spent a lot of time with the best scientists : are we going to have to get carbon emissions down to zero ?
is it okay ?
and the answer is , unless we get zero , the temperature goes up , it &apos;s going to be a big challenge , and the answer is , unless we get zero , the temperature will continue to explode .
and the answer is , unless we get zero , the temperature goes up , it &apos;s going to be a big challenge .
it &apos;s not like a 12 @-@ foot truck passed 10 feet through a 10 @-@ foot bridge , so it &apos;s not like trying to get a 12 @-@ foot truck through a 10 @-@ foot bridge , if you can get the wrong one .
carbon dioxide emissions are completely reduced to zero .
we have a huge amount of CO2 per year , more than <unk> billion tons of CO2 per year , which is worth more than four billion tons of CO2 per year .
we have about 20 tons per capita , and less than a ton per capita , about five tons per capita , and about 20 tons of oil per capita , and less than a ton per capita to about five tons per capita .
it &apos;s about 20 tons per capita , and no one ton per capita , about five tons per capita .
however , we all have to make a difference , until we drop the number down to zero , and we all have to make a difference , until we turn that number down to zero .
the numbers are still rising , and the only nuclear power is to inhibit its growth a little bit .
the numbers are still rising , and the only nuclear force is to inhibit its growth a little bit , and we need to reverse it , not only to close it up fast , but to get it down to zero , to zero , to stop it fast , to keep it moving , to get it down to zero .
there are four factors for CO2 , <unk> multiplied by four factors : carbon dioxide equations , equations , equations , equations , carbon dioxide -- on the left @-@ hand side , our goal is to take it down to zero CO2 per capita , per capita per capita , per capita use of electricity to use per capita to look at the total amount of carbon dioxide per capita as we use .
obviously , we need at least one factor , which is very high school algebra .
clearly , we need at least one factor , which is a very simple high school algebra , and if you look at it , the first is the population .
let &apos;s see , first of all , population .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and it &apos;s going to grow to about nine billion people .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and it &apos;s going to grow to about nine billion people .
if we can do that in a new vaccine , health care , reproductive health , and if we can do that in new vaccine , health care , successful in reproductive health , and that number probably can reduce that by about 10 to 15 percent , and that will probably reduce that number by about 10 to 15 percent .
the second factor is what we use .
this includes all sorts of things : our food , our clothing , our heat , our heat , our heat , our heat , are all these wonderful things : everything that we eat , our clothes , our clothes , our <unk> , our heat , our heat , our <unk> , are beautiful things .
this includes all sorts of things : the food we eat , the clothing , the television , the heat , the heat , the things that are so good to get out of poverty , and that means providing them to everyone on the planet , and that poison is good enough to get away from the poor , and it &apos;s good for everybody on the planet .
getting rid of poverty means providing these services to everybody on the planet , and it &apos;s a good thing .
in the developed world , the richest billion people , may be able to control , reduce the amount of services that are in the developing world , the richest one in the world , may be able to control , reduce consumption , but in general , the number is going to grow up , not just the number per capita , but the number is going to be more than the sum of services per capita .
in this area , we have a very base of services : are there any lights that you can write in your home , and in this case , we have a very basic set of services : are there any homework lights in your home ?
the kids don &apos;t , so they go out and sit underneath the desk and the kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going to go out and sit underneath the desk and write the assignments .
the next factor is efficiency , the energy consumption of every service , and in this case we have some good news : it won &apos;t go up .
and here we have some good news at the end : that &apos;s not going to go up .
through all sorts of designs and new lighting , through new vehicles , new buildings , new approaches , new approaches , new ways of lighting , new ways of lighting , new ways of building , we can reduce the amount of energy we consume by making a lot of money , maybe 90 percent , or 90 percent of the amount of energy we can consume .
we can reduce the amount of energy consumed by a lot of services , individual services , and even 90 percent .
but other services like fertilizer , fertilizer , <unk> , can be more limited , but other services , such as fertilizer , <unk> and so forth , can be more limited , but other services like fertilizer , fertilizer , fertilizer and so forth , can be more limited .
so , with respect , the estimate of this optimism is that we may be able to achieve three to six @-@ fold decline , so , combined , the positive estimate is that we might be able to achieve three or six times .
we &apos;ve been talking about three factors : three tons , we &apos;re going to go from zero to 130 million tons , which is not enough to talk about three factors , three factors that we &apos;re going to get from <unk> to 130 tons , which is not enough to talk about three tons , which is not enough to get the most emissions from zero tons .
and finally , we &apos;re looking at the fourth factor , which is the key , and at the end , we &apos;re looking at the fourth factor , and one of the key factors is carbon dioxide per unit .
the question is , can this take us down to zero ?
it &apos;s not going to work . it &apos;s not going to work .
it &apos;s not going to work . it &apos;s not going to work .
all the power we have today generates CO2 , besides the developing renewables and nuclear power , all the electricity that we have today generates CO2 , all the renewables that we have in the developing world .
so we need to build a new system around the world , and we need energy miracle , so we need to build a new system around the globe , and we need energy .
so we need to build a new system around the world , and we need energy miracle .
while I use the word <unk> , it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s a miracle , the PC is a miracle , the Internet and all its applications .
it &apos;s a miracle , the PC is a miracle , the Internet and all its applications .
in other words , many of you have seen and even participate in a miracle .
generally , we don &apos;t have a final deadline for a miracle , so we don &apos;t have a final set of scenarios .
normally , you just don &apos;t act and something happens , and some of them don &apos;t .
but with low carbon emissions , we have to go all the way , and get to the end of the story , but before low carbon emissions , we have to go all the way to the end of the day .
I thought , how am I going to put this problem better ? is there a natural expression ?
I thought , how am I going to put this problem better ? is there a natural expression that can inspire people &apos;s imaginations ?
and I was thinking about a year ago , and I got some mosquitoes here , which is pretty much like me back about a year ago , and I brought some mosquitos here , which is pretty good .
it really struck the realization that some of the people in the world live with mosquitos , and the ones that made the difference between the mosquitoes , the people in the world , are living with the mosquitoes .
so , today &apos;s talk about energy , I think about this : fireflies .
I decided , I &apos;m going to send fireflies to my environment this year , and I &apos;m going to make a contribution to the environment that I &apos;ve made this year .
this is a few natural fireflies that say they don &apos;t bite , and they probably won &apos;t .
this is a few natural fireflies that say they don &apos;t bite , and they probably won &apos;t .
this is a few natural fireflies that are told that they don &apos;t bite , and maybe they &apos;ve all figured out that that that &apos;s a problem with fireflies , but it &apos;s actually quite limited to the problem with fireflies , but it &apos;s very limited in fact very limited .
what we need is a solution , a , or a lot of things , which are very serious and predictable solutions , and what we need is a solution , or a lot of serious solutions , and what we need is a solution , or a lot of <unk> and reliability solutions , even though people are in the right direction .
I don &apos;t include the waves , the <unk> , the <unk> and the biofuels , and those are going to contribute .
I don &apos;t include the <unk> , the <unk> , or the biofuels , which are going to make a difference if they show me much more than what I expect , but the key is that we have to engage in all of these things , but the key is that we don &apos;t seem to have a huge amount of money on the surface , because they don &apos;t seem to be challenged .
first of all , fossil fuels , or <unk> , or <unk> , first of all , are fossil fuels , or <unk> or <unk> .
what we need to do is to say , simply , what we need to do is we need to take all the burning of carbon dioxide , the emissions , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the whole thing that we need to do is to take all the waste , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> ,
now the current trials have been able to do 60 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult one to do a 100 percent @-@ to @-@ 80 , 80 percent , but to do 100 percent , and where it &apos;s going to be stored , it &apos;s going to be a long @-@ term problem .
who would make sure that ?
that waste is worth billions of times more than any other waste , who can make sure that long @-@ term safety waste is worth a billion times more than any other waste , and who can make sure that long @-@ term security ?
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 . it &apos;s very difficult .
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 . it &apos;s very difficult .
next , nuclear power , which has three big problems .
next , nuclear power , again , has three big problems , and particularly high @-@ security states , are very safe , to make sure that everything is controlled , even if it &apos;s not used for weapons .
what about nuclear waste ?
it &apos;s not too big , but there &apos;s a lot of worry about .
good solutions have to make people feel secure .
it &apos;s three difficult , but it &apos;s possible to solve , so it &apos;s going to work .
the last three energy sources , I &apos;m going to put together .
this is what people call the renewables .
in fact , they don &apos;t need it , but they don &apos;t have to make a dent .
first of all , the density of the technology that we &apos;re collecting , is much lower than the power plant , which is the density of these technologies , is far lower than the power plant .
it &apos;s energy agriculture , and it &apos;s scale @-@ up , it &apos;s bigger than conventional power .
and also , these energy are dual @-@ edged .
the Sun is not all day long , it &apos;s not always the same , it &apos;s always the wind .
if you &apos;re dependent on this source , you have other channels of energy available , you have to have other channels of energy available and you have to have other routes to energy .
so , we have a huge cost , and we have a huge supply challenge , for example , a source of energy coming out of the country , not only are you going to need to respond to energy insecurity in the country .
and finally , the issue of stored .
in order to make this happen , I looked at all of the current batteries that we have in order to make the problem tangible , and I looked carefully at all the current batteries , the computer , the <unk> , the power of all the things that we currently have in our bodies , and I found that we &apos;re not going to be able to consume all the energy that is available .
so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough to do a fairly hundred times better than the current technology , which requires a hundred times more than a hundred times more than a hundred times better solution .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
so we can use <unk> energy for 20 percent -- 30 percent of the energy needed .
but if you want 100 percent dependent on it , you need a very efficient miracle .
so how do we go ? where do we go ?
is this a Manhattan Project ? how can we get there ?
we need a lot of companies to work together , to work with them .
every one of the five approaches , we all need at least 100 people .
a lot of people inside , you think they &apos;re mad , that &apos;s right .
I think there are a lot of people in the TED community who are beginning to do this .
Bill <unk> has <unk> , and one of them is called <unk> , which is a very cool <unk> , and Bill <unk> <unk> , and one of them is a company called <unk> , which has a very nice , very hot , very hot , very well solar technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> investing in <unk> , their work is fantastic , and it makes fun , and I plan to support their projects .
now , <unk> and I have been supportive of a company which may be surprising to me , but this is a company of nuclear power .
in nuclear power , it &apos;s a little bit of innovation , like <unk> , liquid , liquid , etc .
but actually , innovation has stopped at some point in the business , and so there &apos;s some good ideas that are not weird .
and the idea was that , instead of burning uranium , low @-@ tech ideas , you &apos;re not supposed to burn the usual suspects , you &apos;re going to burn 99 percent .
it &apos;s kind of a crazy idea , but actually , people have been talking about it for a long time .
it &apos;s a little crazy idea , but in fact , people have been talking about a long time , but they &apos;re not going to be able to mimic whether it &apos;s possible that modern supercomputers enhance our ability to do it now , and it can be predictable , and it can be feasible , and it can be possible .
and because of the fact that we &apos;re burning , 99 percent of the waste that used to be used to be quite dramatically lowering .
you actually take the waste and you don &apos;t have to worry about how to process all the nuclear waste that &apos;s out there , it &apos;s a good news .
we don &apos;t have to worry about how to process all the nuclear waste we have , which is a good news .
it &apos;s like a candle , it &apos;s got to uranium .
it &apos;s like this column , which is often called a <unk> reactor .
the problem with fuel is solved .
this is a waste from Kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , and that &apos;s 99 percent of the fuel that &apos;s already out of business is called <unk> .
these can be power to the United States for hundreds of years .
and also , just through the low @-@ cost water process , it &apos;s enough to use the <unk> of the Earth .
you see , there &apos;s a lot of challenge in the front , but this is just one example of one of the methods that we &apos;re going to move forward .
think about it , how do we measure our achievements ?
how much would our school score ?
let &apos;s take a step further and take a look at our main goals , and look at our main goals , and look at our main goals .
a lot of people are talking about 80 percent by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important . we have to do it .
and the top 20 percent should be in poverty , like some agricultural countries , and hopefully we have clean up <unk> and concrete .
so , to get to 80 percent of the developed world , and the Chinese nations need to change their power .
and then the next step is , are we going to deploy the <unk> technology , whether we &apos;re going to be able to do it all over the developed world , and in other parts of the world ?
it &apos;s very important .
this is the key factor for the good .
what about the year 2020 ?
well , there are two elements .
we need to be careful about the metrics in how we can start to reduce the amount of CO2 in our emissions , the lower temperature of CO2 .
but at some point , we &apos;ve done some work in the year 2020 , but it &apos;s not just the equivalent of a massive loss of emissions , or a low @-@ budget , and that &apos;s the key to innovation .
we need to be able to do all these technological advances , and we can use the number of companies to experiment with , or the pace of regulation .
there &apos;s a lot of good books about this .
for example , Al Gore &apos;s &quot; Our Choice &quot; in &quot; The <unk> &quot; -- &quot; <unk> Energy .
they &apos;ve been working on it , and they &apos;ve built a framework that is easy for the question , because we need to be careful about the problem .
it takes a lot of collaboration .
it &apos;s a wish .
we invented this technology as a very specific wish .
if I could choose a next 50 @-@ year wish , I could choose who would come to a president or choose a vaccine that I love , or I would choose to cut the water and cut it , and I would certainly choose the energy supply .
it &apos;s going to be one of the largest influences .
if we can &apos;t achieve that wish , for short @-@ term targets and long @-@ term people , there &apos;s a huge disconnect between the United States and China , rich countries , and rich rich countries , and the two billion of the poorest people in most of the world are going to have a major impact .
so what do we have to do ?
what am I asking you for ?
we need to increase the research .
in a conference like Copenhagen , the nations should not only talk about carbon emissions .
we need to discuss the ideas about innovation , and the engagement of these new approaches is absolutely amazing .
we really need some market incentives , carbon dioxide , <unk> and trade to produce price signals .
we need to get the message out .
we need to make this dialogue more conceptual , more understandable , including the government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , and I think this is a real wish .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you , and I know a little more about <unk> , and first of all , you can say , how big is this investment ?
Bill Gates : if we were to buy a supercomputer and build a good scientist , these are the things that we &apos;ve been able to do with the <unk> , and we even went to a Russian reactors to test our material to see if it would work , but it would cost a few billion dollars .
the hard part of it is to build these experiments , to get billions of dollars , to get to the manager , to build these first nuclear power stations .
when you build the first building , if it does , then everything is simple , because its economy , its density , energy density is completely different from the nuclear that we &apos;re familiar with .
well , does it have to go underground and build a thick , <unk> square that &apos;s made from this sort of <unk> <unk> @-@ like <unk> , a thick , thick , <unk> square that goes from the bottom ?
right . now , with nuclear reactors , you have to keep <unk> fuel , so there &apos;s a lot of <unk> and control , you have to open the reactor , you &apos;ve got to move it out , you &apos;ve got to go away , you &apos;ve got to have no insurance , you &apos;ve got to move it out of the reactor , you &apos;ve got to get out of the wrong stuff .
so , if you have very cheap fuel , a two @-@ wheeler that &apos;s size for 60 years , so if you have very cheap fuel , a fee @-@ efficient fuel , put it down in 60 years , there is no such complex consequences .
put it there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s gone .
that nuclear power is the waste disposal of waste .
right . and the process of this process is created , you can put it there and you can make very little amounts of waste , you can put it in a different nuclear power plant , you can burn it in a different nuclear power plant .
we can start to process the waste from existing nuclear power plants , the ones that are cooled in the pool or the reactor , which is where we &apos;re going to start .
so , the current reactor is in trouble , but it &apos;s also our material , and it &apos;s reducing the waste so that the current waste is in trouble , and it &apos;s become our material , and it &apos;s reducing our waste so that we are in trouble , and at the same time we &apos;re in trouble , we &apos;re losing our energy , and that stuff like that .
you talk to people anywhere else in the conversation about these possibilities .
who is interested in doing this ?
J We have not chosen a specific place , because there are secrecy everywhere , and a lot of people are interested in Russia , India , China , in China , has been interested in doing this before , and I &apos;ve been talking about how I &apos;ve been talking about energy history before .
and I was very optimistic , and also French and Japan have done some work .
this is a variant of what has been done .
it &apos;s an important improvement , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor that many countries have built , as long as you &apos;ve already had fast reactors , it could be the first nuclear waste ever made possible .
what about the time and possibility of this project ?
Bill Gates : build a massive power plant and cost very low @-@ cost . build a very low @-@ cost power plant , and cost very low , we have 20 years to invent .
it &apos;s about the end of our environmental model , and it &apos;s about the end of our environmental model , and it &apos;s about the end of our environment .
if the best of all , of course , it would be very easy , to meet the very best requirements , and of course , it would be very easy to meet .
there are still four or five companies working on this , and we need to be able to figure out if they &apos;re going to advance the progress of their power plants , they &apos;re all going to win this task .
if it &apos;s successful , it &apos;s best because it can be used at the same time .
but we need at least one .
if that is possible , this is the biggest innovation you know .
climate : energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
even if it &apos;s not limited , it &apos;s going to be the most important environmental limitations that make it wider .
there are other innovators in nuclear .
but I don &apos;t know a lot about their work , and we don &apos;t know a lot about people &apos;s innovation in the project , but it &apos;s a different way .
there &apos;s also a liquid reactor that &apos;s kind of hard to do , but maybe they look at us in a way .
so , there &apos;s a lot of different approaches , but the beauty of nuclear power is that a very high @-@ powered molecule is a lot of other energy , like coal , but the beautiful thing about nuclear , uranium , which is the power of nuclear power that comes in from other things : a million times the potential for the potential to deal with the potential .
Moderator : what if we didn &apos;t succeed ?
what kind of instability do we need to make the planet &apos;s temperature ?
Bill Gates : if things are growing like eating too much , could you have a heart attack ? you might need heart surgery , etc .
there &apos;s a study called geo @-@ engineering that keeps global warming possible for 20 or 30 years to come together .
but that was like a insurance policy .
you don &apos;t want to use it .
some people say , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
and if you think about the importance of the problem , I don &apos;t know if this is going to be a sensible conversation about the planet today , in case it &apos;s going to get worse , or it &apos;s going to be late for us .
Moderator : how would you convince them of climate change if you convince them of telling them how to convince them ?
sadly , the Skeptics comes from different camps .
very few of them have scientific evidence .
they said that the rustle in the cloud were due to the cloud , and they said the <unk> result was due to the cloud .
they have very few compelling evidence that even a one @-@ in @-@ a @-@ million chance .
the main problem here is HIV .
now , errors are going to double their suffering .
so , when you &apos;re faced with an issue of concern , it &apos;s now about pain in the future , and it &apos;s not a big deal , the IPCC report , it &apos;s not the worst case , and some people in the developed world looked at it and said , &quot; This is not a big deal .
in fact , the uncertainty of the matter should lead us to this .
but my wish is , if you make energy production , and you match CO2 limit , but my wish is that , if you turn energy into an economy , and the word &quot; <unk> &quot; says , well , I don &apos;t care more about CO2 than I &apos;ve ever thought .
but I &apos;m going to take this new approach , because energy is cheaper than the original one : you can say , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing if you spend all your energy trying to solve CO2 problems , then you &apos;re going to replace all the other things that are important to solve CO2 , or that we &apos;re going to have to solve the energy in the world .
J Not much , though , while the United States should be spending more than 100 dollars a year on this , it shouldn &apos;t affect other things that the R &amp; amp ; D. &amp; amp ; D. &amp; amp ; quot ; R &amp; amp ; quot ; R &amp; amp ; quot ; So it wasn &apos;t supposed to affect how much of America &apos;s R &amp; amp ; D.
J The actual R &amp; amp ; amp ; quot ; So it shouldn &apos;t make any difference if the United States should be spending more than 100 dollars a year .
for the sake of the economy , if the economy doesn &apos;t give back a return , for me it &apos;s basically a waste of time , and it &apos;s possible that it &apos;s not possible for the sake of the economy , if it &apos;s not for the economy , for me , it &apos;s probably not possible that many people disagree about the economic consequences , if not the economic consequences .
unless you &apos;ve been very close to success , and you &apos;re investing in the business , and it &apos;s going to be cheap , until you &apos;re very close to success , and you &apos;re going to be cheap , and it &apos;s going to be cheap , and I think we should try to have low @-@ cost solutions , or I think we should try to have low @-@ cost solutions .
if you solve the climate , you can make energy expensive , you can get rich , you can get rich , you can get rich enough to solve the climate , and you can make energy more expensive , and the rich is rich .
for those of you who sit down for five times , it &apos;s not going to affect our lifestyles , and it &apos;s not going to affect our lifestyles if it &apos;s five times more likely to affect our lifestyles .
but for the two billion people on the planet , it was a disaster .
and the idea of the <unk> has changed , and he &apos;s got a lot more attention now .
and the idea of the <unk> has changed , and he &apos;s got a lot more attention now .
it &apos;s based on historical reasons , he &apos;s still a <unk> camp , but he &apos;s already realizing that it &apos;s a fairly lonely place , and he &apos;s a very lonely place , but he &apos;s realized that that it &apos;s a very lonely camp , and he &apos;s been alone , but he &apos;s already realized that it &apos;s very lonely , and he &apos;s been very lonely .
and I think that &apos;s a very interesting topic , because the input of science is so expensive .
and I think that &apos;s a very interesting topic , because the input of science is so expensive .
Bill , I think a lot of people here are like me , really hope you do , thank you very much .
thank you .
a few years ago at TED , Peter <unk> introduced a design challenge called the <unk> Challenge , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a very simple idea : a group of four people creating a single solid material , 20 <unk> , Italy , a series of little threads in it .
the marshmallow must be at the top .
it &apos;s not easy , it &apos;s not easy , because it requires people to work fast .
I think it &apos;s an interesting idea that I put it in a design meeting .
it was very successful .
since then , I &apos;ve been working on over 70 design campaigns around the world , where students and designers and even the 50 @-@ strong technology <unk> that practice has inspired us in many ways a number of ways to teach us how to collaborate , where I share some of these with you .
usually , people are always talking about finishing their task .
they &apos;re talking about what they say , what they say they &apos;re right and wrong .
and then they spend a little bit of time thinking , &quot; Well , they draw the blueprints , and they take out the <unk> in Italy .
they took a lot of time to put the <unk> in Italy , to get more and more high .
and then finally , the time was finished , they took the marshmallow very delicately , and they took a step back , and they looked at what they did .
but most of the time , what happened was the <unk> , the <unk> , became terrible , because the weight of the marshmallow gave the whole structure .
so there are a few of them who are unemployed for school , who are worse than others , and the worst of all is the graduate business .
they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re vulnerable to the <unk> , they &apos;re very bad .
and of course , there are teams that have created more expressive balls , and the best one is the new kindergarten .
it &apos;s amazing .
as Laura Lee told us , not only did they make the highest building , but they built the most interesting structure .
so you ask , what &apos;s going on ? what do they have ?
and Peter likes to say , &quot; Because no child wants to be the CEO of a company in Italy , &quot; <unk> is the <unk> .
they &apos;re not spending any time on power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
because business school students are trained to find the right thing .
and they follow the plan .
but the truth is , when they put the marshmallow at the top , they took a finite amount of time , and what happens ?
the crisis is over .
sounds familiar ? yeah .
the kindergarten kids do different things , and they start with the marshmallow , they take a model , and they keep modeling , and they keep it on the top of the models , and so they &apos;ve always had a chance to go for a model .
so the designers realized that this is a key factor in interaction .
for every version , the child will immediately get the feedback and they know what &apos;s going on .
so the capability of the prototype is real , and let &apos;s look at how different teams work .
the average height of most buildings is 20 feet high , and the average school is about half a lawyer , but not anywhere in kindergarten , it &apos;s better than most adults .
who &apos;s doing the best ?
architects and engineers , thank God .
the highest building I &apos;ve ever seen is 39 inches .
why ? because they understand the geometric model of the triangle and self @-@ reinforcing geometry is the key structure of the building .
the president is a little better than average , but interestingly .
if you add a class in their group , they get a lot better .
it &apos;s amazing , you look around , you say , &quot; <unk> won . come on .
you know , why ?
because they have very specific simplicity .
they manage the process . they do .
anyway , any group of activists are engaged and focused on their own work has dramatically improved dramatically .
special skills and good combination of simplicity led to success .
if you have a 10 @-@ year @-@ old , you have about six or six of them that can build a structure that can stand up .
I made a very interesting try .
I think , let &apos;s make a bet .
so I &apos;m going to provide a $ 100,000 software for the <unk> .
you know what happens to the students who designed it ?
what happens ?
and this is the result that no group has done a standing building .
even if any group has done an inch in an inch , they can fold the bomb back .
so , what &apos;s interesting is that the professionals have a huge impact .
and then we repeated this in the same student .
and guess what ?
and here they know the value of the <unk> model .
so the worst group became the best team .
they &apos;ve done the most difficult building ever .
these are very deep education implications that we all have , that are the essence of reward and success .
so , you might ask yourself : how do you spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
and the reason for that is that I can use <unk> and processes to help people build cars , video games and visualization .
the challenge of the marshmallow is to recognize some hypotheses that are hidden .
because , frankly , every project has its own cotton .
and the challenge is to share the experience of a common language process .
it &apos;s this simple exercise that gives us valuable experience .
if you &apos;re interested in <unk>
this is a blog that you can read about how you build a marshmallow .
there are specific steps .
there &apos;s also weird examples from around the world that people can adjust the system .
there is a world record there .
and I believe that the fundamental rule of design is actually a movement .
it asked us to take all our <unk> and put them in the task and ask us to use the best mental state in which we perceive our actions to confront .
and at some point , a very small model will help us transform the moment in which we turn it into a phase transition , which is a very bad time .
the result of that is very different .
thank you .
let &apos;s imagine there &apos;s a machine here .
it &apos;s a big , cool machine , TED , and it &apos;s a time machine .
everybody &apos;s going to go into this time .
you can choose to go back to the past or to the future , which is not going to be closed at the moment .
I &apos;m thinking about how you might choose , and I &apos;ve asked my friend a couple of times more , and they &apos;ve all been <unk> back to the past .
I don &apos;t understand . they say , go back to zero cars or Twitter or America &apos;s time .
I really don &apos;t understand .
I &apos;m sure there must be some <unk> or some <unk> .
I can understand that .
but I have to admit , I &apos;m not a part of it .
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , not because I like adventure .
it &apos;s because the probability of the Earth is not going to get to the future .
in other words , I wanted to walk into this machine and go to the future .
our age is the best time , whether you measure it in any way , like health , mobility , opportunity , unprecedented rates .
it &apos;s never been so good .
my grandparents died when they were 60 .
my grandparents died in their 70s .
my parents died when they died .
I wish I &apos;d died at the beginning of a nine @-@ digit number .
but it &apos;s not just about us , because it &apos;s bigger than us .
a kid born today in New Delhi can be the <unk> of the world like 100 years ago .
think about it . it &apos;s a wonderful fact .
why would that happen ?
it &apos;s because we eradicated smallpox . smallpox killed the hundreds of millions of people on the planet .
it &apos;s <unk> the population of the Earth &apos;s population , and it can &apos;t be compared to any war .
but it &apos;s been wiped out today .
it &apos;s been created by man .
in today &apos;s rich societies today only gave millions of people a chance of dying , it was almost no longer possible .
<unk> <unk> , Germany , almost no polio .
you know what those names mean ?
vaccines and modern medicine and millions of people providing food for millions of people are triumph of science .
in my view , the scientific method is continuously trying to test , to change the process . it &apos;s one of the greatest <unk> of human beings .
so that &apos;s good news .
but sadly , the good news is so much , because we have other problems , and it &apos;s been mentioned a lot .
one of the things is that , although we &apos;ve made a big progress , we have a billion people in the world every day who are starving .
the numbers are rising and rising , and it &apos;s fast enough .
not only that , but the imagination of human imagination brought a big landfill .
drinking water , tropical rainforests , oil , natural gas , all of these resources are disappearing and disappearing very quickly until we understand innovation , we don &apos;t have any hope .
the question is : can we do that ? I think we can .
I think we can produce enough food for billions of people , and not damage the land that they live on .
I think we can find <unk> energy to supply the world &apos;s energy .
I do believe in that , and it &apos;s absolutely not true .
but I &apos;ve always come across what keeps me awake at night , and this is something that makes me cry at night , and it &apos;s never been possible in human history to advance technological progress .
and we &apos;ve never had a time in history where we can use these technologies for our will .
in many areas , we &apos;re all standing in the midst of amazing discovery , and in fact , I think we need to look back , 300 years ago , back in the Renaissance , only people who were going to be going to be going to be more violent than we are today .
people are always interested in putting themselves in their own frame , and they are dying so much , often not dead .
you can &apos;t get them to be able to shake the truth .
listen , everybody can maintain his opinion , and they can even insist on the idea of progress .
but do you know what you can &apos;t stick with ?
you can &apos;t just stick with what you know . you can &apos;t .
I &apos;ve spent some time trying to figure it out .
about 10 years ago , I wrote a story about the New Yorker , a story about small vaccine .
but what I found was that there was a real struggle against me was the most effective public health measures in human history .
I really don &apos;t know how to do that , and I &apos;m just going to do what I &apos;m going to do .
soon , I wrote a article about genetically modified foods .
it &apos;s got a lot of opposition , and it &apos;s over time .
people were mad .
so I wrote an article on that , and I couldn &apos;t really understand why people would understand it as a mosaic disease , and I don &apos;t understand why people would think that , in a certain way , instead of trying to carry the biotech molecules in nature .
but I was just going to do what I was going to do , and I ended up doing it anyway .
I &apos;m a journalist .
our job is to write and release and eat , and that &apos;s our life .
but it didn &apos;t make me feel good , I didn &apos;t know what was going on until I knew it .
the ones that used to force me crazy , psychopathic molecules were not actually <unk> .
they are people with ideas , educated people , and integrity .
they &apos;re like the people in this room .
it really bothers me .
and I thought , actually , to be honest .
we have a different relation to progress today .
we &apos;re looking at progress in a very confusing way .
we &apos;re going to talk about progress in the context of the ironic reason that we can talk about progress in our pockets .
I think there &apos;s a reason for that , and we know why .
our institutions , our citizens , our government , sometimes even for science , have lost the trust , and maybe we have a non @-@ trust reason .
you know what &apos;s going on .
Chernobyl , <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of massive @-@ scale drugs , of massive @-@ scale votes .
I think you can put a list in your own mind .
we &apos;ve always had a complete faith in the past , and it &apos;s now a problem , so you have to have a little more skeptical .
ask a couple of questions , ask for evidence and evidence .
you don &apos;t believe anything .
but one thing to notice is that when you get the evidence , you need to take the evidence , but we &apos;re not good at doing it .
and the reason for that , I think , is that we now have the fear of a epidemic of an epidemic of an epidemic and a deep layer that I &apos;d never experienced before , and hopefully will never be done .
12 years ago , the media got a message , and it was a very scary news , and it took the autism and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> vaccine together .
it &apos;s really scary .
so there &apos;s a lot of research going on around it .
and it does have to do that , because it &apos;s a serious event .
and the data came out .
from the United States , the U.K. , Sweden , Canada &apos;s data has shown the same results : autism and vaccines that don &apos;t have anything to it , there is no relationship .
but that turns out there is not too much for the general public , because we like to listen to small stories , we believe in our eyes , believing that what we see in our minds is believing in things that are real .
but I don &apos;t believe a bunch of <unk> documents , I don &apos;t believe in government data , and I can understand that , and I think all of us have this kind of psychological .
but what happens ?
the consequences are unbelievable .
listen to this fact : the United States is the only country in the world where nearly 1.2 million people are heading .
it &apos;s enough for us to be ashamed , and we should be ashamed of that .
it &apos;s a very scary thing .
what caused this happen ?
now I got it . I really got it .
how many of you have exceeded it ?
how many of you have seen someone dying of dementia ?
not too much , not too much .
in fact , it won &apos;t happen in this country , but in the last year , 16 million people were dying of HIV .
it &apos;s a big number , it &apos;s basically 20 people every hour , so it died .
but because it didn &apos;t happen to us , we could do whatever it was , like that guy in <unk> , that would still be able to disseminate their fears and ignorance on TV .
they did it because they didn &apos;t put the link together .
they don &apos;t know , things that look like that actually look the same .
we need lessons from that and we need to learn more .
this man , <unk> <unk> , was a hero .
because he invented the polio vaccine to get people to avoid the worst disaster .
now people don &apos;t need to be afraid of this disease , they don &apos;t have the pain , they &apos;re gone .
the man in the middle is not so good .
he called Paul <unk> .
he made a <unk> vaccine with a couple of other researchers .
this vaccine can save four million children in the developing world every year .
it &apos;s good , right ?
it &apos;s good . this is a Paul that goes around and talks about how good they are , how good they are , how good they are .
he did .
so , we think of Paul as terrorism .
when Paul had to disclose , he had to have armed guards .
he would get a call at home because they would tell him where he was in school .
why ? because Paul invented a vaccine .
I don &apos;t have to say this , but vaccines are incredibly important .
once the vaccine stops , the disease will come back again , and it &apos;s a very horrible disease that &apos;s going on .
now the United States has come along with measles .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and very soon , there &apos;s children dying of this disease , which is just a digital problem .
not just about measles .
with polio , who says it &apos;s not going to happen again ?
one of my classmates wrote a letter a few weeks ago , and she said that I &apos;m a little too nerdy .
nobody said that before .
she said she wasn &apos;t going to give the children polio vaccine . it certainly wouldn &apos;t .
okay .
why ? because there is no polio in this country , but you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have this epidemic yesterday .
today , I don &apos;t know , maybe a public airplane from Lagos , and his destination was Los Angeles airport , and it &apos;s now in Ohio .
a few hours later , he would get to the ground , he would come to Long Beach , and he would come to a TED conference .
he didn &apos;t know he was infected with polio , we didn &apos;t know it was the world .
that &apos;s how we are . don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
we like to believe that lies . we like to do that .
do you have vitamin per morning ?
or if you &apos;re a little <unk> or a little bit of <unk> , you just have the feeling of being sober .
the reason you do that is because half the Americans do this every day .
they &apos;re going to eat this , they &apos;re going to eat <unk> , even though we already know it &apos;s not going to work .
that &apos;s what the data is .
it &apos;s not going to make you black , it &apos;s not going to work .
if you &apos;re willing to spend billions of dollars to get some black <unk> in there .
I &apos;m not against it .
it &apos;s black urine , it &apos;s black .
why do you do that ? why ?
I think I can understand . we have a huge business in the country .
we all hate big government because we don &apos;t trust people in that .
but we don &apos;t have to do that . our healthcare system is very poor .
it &apos;s a cruel system for millions of people .
and for those who can afford to pay , it &apos;s also a very , very ruthless health system .
so we &apos;re trying to get away from that system . where do we go ?
we &apos;ve got a big part of a placebo .
and this is a wonderful -- oh , I like to have a placebo .
but you know , it &apos;s a serious thing because it &apos;s a big thing , but we &apos;re not going to have a trillion dollars to buy a placebo .
I have all kinds of samples here .
they don &apos;t have the same effect , whether it &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , I don &apos;t know what it is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars to buy them , which is deception .
but you know what ? when I say here , people are screaming for me , they say , what &apos;s wrong with you ? let &apos;s ask people to do it !
don &apos;t get a placebo at least . &quot;
you know ? you &apos;re wrong .
I &apos;m not going to be fast @-@ forward . if the U.S. Health Minister and the Minister of Public Health , I won &apos;t care what the experts find on breast X number of photos are , &quot; or a cancer <unk> wants to get his patients through the coffee box .
if you believe in faith and magic and non @-@ scientific , you end up in a place where you don &apos;t want to go .
maybe you will eventually become the former leader of South Africa .
he insisted that he argued that <unk> and <unk> are better at reducing the health of HIV than we know it , and that leads to 400,000 people dying of HIV .
tens of thousands of people who were not supposed to die were killed , and they were the worst of HIV infections in the world .
don &apos;t tell me that these examples don &apos;t make sense .
the consequences are yes , always there .
now , the most conserved epidemic that we &apos;re exposed to is the result of genetically engineered crop versus <unk> .
it &apos;s also a stupid argument . we have to stop that .
because arguing is just the word and the metaphor itself .
it &apos;s about ideology , not about science .
every single thing that we have in our belly , every <unk> , every single <unk> , every single one of them has changed .
because there was no orange in the Garden of Eden .
there &apos;s no <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to have Christmas . it &apos;s all made @-@ up .
humans have made these things for the last 11 years .
some trials succeeded , some of them failed .
the ones that failed attempt were falling apart .
and now we can do this in a more precise way , which is risky , but we can put vitamin A in a rice gene , which will save millions of lives , or extend their life .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
I just said , I don &apos;t understand that .
a lot of us are against genetically modified foods .
why ?
and the reason I &apos;ve always heard is that there &apos;s too much chemistry , too much pesticides , too much testosterone , too much testosterone , too much <unk> @-@ to @-@ produce , and we don &apos;t really want to have the same crops that we &apos;re making .
we don &apos;t want businesses to be a new crop .
we don &apos;t want to let big businesses run .
can you imagine the response to these objections ?
well , guess what , let &apos;s do that .
well , we have a very serious food problem , but it &apos;s not science .
because it &apos;s not science .
this is legal , ethical , patent law .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a nation .
it &apos;s not even an idea , it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s sometimes successful , sometimes it &apos;s successful , but because we &apos;re afraid that we shouldn &apos;t let scientists go and learn how to do it is scary , and it will prevent millions of people to go to prosperity .
we need to grow 70 percent more food in the next 50 years .
this is what we &apos;ve been investing in in Africa for the last 30 years .
it &apos;s very humbling .
people were there , but we didn &apos;t give them .
why ? genetically modified foods .
we don &apos;t encourage people to eat the wrong food , like the wrong rice .
five million people in the world are made of rice .
it &apos;s a little bit like a potato .
it &apos;s only calories , it &apos;s not good taste .
no <unk> , no protein , and now scientists are trying to put this in the <unk> .
and when you eat that , you can lose sight .
it &apos;s not going to starve . you &apos;ll get it .
it &apos;s good . it &apos;s not a good restaurant , but it &apos;s good .
I just said , why would some people argue against this ?
ask yourself : why are we against this ?
because don &apos;t we want to move the genome ?
it &apos;s just moving some genomes , nothing related to adding chemicals .
it doesn &apos;t have to do with the hormone . we want to get more food , better food , more food .
it &apos;s not a meter @-@ long , it &apos;s just trying to get some of the live lives , but it &apos;s time for us to really understand the meaning of this process .
you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , we stick with it right now , we &apos;re going to get a future because something we don &apos;t want to happen , and it &apos;s going to be technological colonialism .
no other word is more appropriate to describe this .
it &apos;s a selfish , <unk> , so that we have to stop our dignity and we have to stop doing that .
now , after a very interesting conversation like this , you might say , you &apos;re going to walk into this machine all the time , and you &apos;re going to go in the future , right ?
of course . I certainly would .
the machine is now sitting today , but we have a very good opportunity .
we can build any time machine .
to get there , we can go there and get to where we really want to get there .
we need to start talking like this , and we need to think , when we enter the time of time and the future , we will enjoy our choices .
I believe that we can , and that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
yeah .
and I was interested in doing something about a placebo , and usually a magician isn &apos;t interested in doing something about a placebo , but if you think about it from my career , that is to make something that actually makes people believe that they become real .
in other words , what you can do in some studies is measure the effects of a placebo , because people think that what happens to them is a drug , or give a case to a patient if they believe it &apos;s a drug called <unk> , and there &apos;s a marked effect on them .
the fake thing becomes real because people understand it .
to understand each other , I want to start showing you a very simple , simple magic .
I &apos;ll tell you how I got started . this is a simple magic that comes out of the &apos; 50s .
when I was in the &apos; 70s , I learned it from magic to child school .
I &apos;ll just show you , and then I &apos;ll explain that .
I &apos;ll explain why I &apos;m going to explain that .
see , this is how it &apos;s magic .
it &apos;s a knife . you can examine it ; my hand , you can check .
I put my hand in my hand .
and I put my sleeve up .
and to make sure that nothing can go up and down my sleeve , I &apos;ll just keep my wrist .
so you can see there &apos;s no time for anything to happen , and there &apos;s nothing to go through my sleeve .
it &apos;s very simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hands up , and hopefully , if all things go well , my physical magnetic mass will stick to it .
in fact , it was so tight that I could even get the knife back .
there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , no tricks . you can look at everything .
okay .
well , it &apos;s a magic that I &apos;ve always taught kids that are interested in magic because you can learn a lot about deception by learning about this magic -- even though it &apos;s a very simple magic .
probably a lot of people here know this magic .
it happened .
I had a knife in my hand .
I said , I &apos;m going to hold my wrist to make sure there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , which is a lie .
the reason I hold my wrist is the secret of the <unk> .
in my hand , when I move your finger towards the top , this finger is my finger , and I &apos;m going to move the headrest from here to the right spot .
okay .
there are a lot of people who don &apos;t have a childhood .
that &apos;s how my finger moves , right from here .
I &apos;m turning my hand around , and my fingers are moving .
we can talk about why this is liar &apos;s , why you don &apos;t notice there &apos;s just three fingers underneath there , because your consciousness , and how we process consciousness , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three . it mixes it .
but that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to talk about today . right ? I &apos;m going to open my hands up again .
obviously it &apos;s lined up there , not by any physiological magnet , but by deception , my index is there .
and I got my fingers , the same way I got , the way I got , the way I got my fingers turned around .
hold the hand . you take the knife .
this trick you can do to your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with a placebo ?
I read a study about a year ago that opened my perception .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this is a surprising thing to me .
it shows that if you give people a placebo in the form of a white pill , what an aspirin is like , if it &apos;s a circle of white pills , it has some measure of a placebo impact .
but if you change the one that you give to a placebo shape , for example , you make it a smaller pill , and you color in blue , and it &apos;s made a more obvious measurement .
even though none of them had any real medicine -- they were <unk> .
but the white pill is no blue , OK ?
what ? it really struck me .
but in fact , that &apos;s not the end .
if you use them , they &apos;re more effective than any form of pills .
there &apos;s a color capsule , yellow , and the red one is more effective than the white capsule .
it &apos;s a very good dose .
one day twice , a piece of <unk> didn &apos;t work . I &apos;m sorry .
but the point is .
the dose is about the drug .
<unk> form and medicine .
if you want to get a placebo at the right level , you need to get an injection .
right ? a syringe contains one or two <unk> , you inject it into a patient .
it &apos;s such a powerful imagination in their head that it should be much better than the white pill .
it &apos;s a very strong imagination , and when I have a slide , I can show you statistics .
the point is that white pill has no blue pill , no <unk> .
they don &apos;t really have a drug . it &apos;s just your belief that makes it real , and it makes it more effective in your body .
I want to see if I can take this idea and apply it to magic tricks .
it &apos;s obvious that a few tricks make it look real .
we know from the study that if you want a <unk> , you use a <unk> .
this is a <unk> cap . it &apos;s very weak . I &apos;m going to put it down .
it &apos;s my muscles . it &apos;s not my <unk> .
that &apos;s my skin . it &apos;s not Hollywood special .
I &apos;m going to stick this needle through my skin through the other side .
if you &apos;re a little nervous -- if you &apos;re not careful -- I &apos;ve played some friends yesterday in the hotel yesterday , and some people I don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a woman who &apos;s nearly eight years old .
so , I &apos;d like to suggest that if you &apos;re easy , you &apos;d better look somewhere in the next 30 seconds , and in fact , you know , I &apos;d be doing the wrong part behind it .
you &apos;ll see that if you want to look somewhere else .
well , this is what happens here , and I have a little hole below my arm .
I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m scared of you ?
it goes through my skin a little bit like this .
now , we &apos;re basically in the same position with a knife .
pretty much .
but you can &apos;t count my finger now , right ?
so , let me show them . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah , oh .
I know what people want when they see this .
and they said , oh , he &apos;s not going to break his skin into play with us for a few minutes .
so let me show you the peek .
how does it look ? good .
yeah , I know .
the people in the back said , okay , I don &apos;t really see that . I don &apos;t see that .
the people in the town are now in the air now .
let me take you through this .
it &apos;s really my skin . it &apos;s not Hollywood special .
it &apos;s my flesh , I can turn it around .
sorry . if you feel disgust , look somewhere else , don &apos;t look at this .
the guy behind the video , or a few years later , will say , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a little bit missing , but if it &apos;s real , it &apos;s got a hole , it &apos;s got a hole , if it &apos;s real , if it &apos;s real .
let me give you some blood .
that &apos;s right .
I &apos;m going to take the needle out anyway .
I &apos;m going to clean my arm and show you I don &apos;t have any wounds .
but I think in this case , in this case , this idea of <unk> things became real , and I &apos;m going to stop there and go .
I &apos;ll see you over the next couple of days .
I want you to look forward . thank you very much .
everybody was talking about happiness recently .
in the last five years , I &apos;ve asked more people to speak up in recent years about <unk> happiness , which is about 40 years , and so on .
more and more researchers are now interested in happiness .
and there &apos;s a lot of heroic <unk> happy coaches .
getting other people happy is their goal .
and while this work gets worse , there &apos;s still a couple cognitive trap that will increase the difficulty of happiness .
I &apos;m going to talk about these cognitive traps today .
these trap effects that normal people think about their happiness and will influence the judgment of scholars , because of the <unk> , we will go awry .
the first trap is the complexity of happiness .
it turns out that happiness is no longer a word for words , because we have too much to interpret .
I think we should define what it means to limit it , but we have to give up this idea and what it &apos;s like to live a more complicated view .
the second one is the association between experience and memory : it &apos;s basically the feeling of happiness and pleasure and the difference between your life and your life .
it &apos;s both important and it &apos;s very happy to be happy .
the third trap is the illusion , unfortunately , in any case , when we think about pleasant life , we think it &apos;s important .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
it &apos;s not <unk> .
now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of a personal <unk> , and I &apos;d been told by <unk> <unk> <unk> , the &#91; unclear &#93; , &#91; unclear &#93; , who said that he had a very nice concert when he was listening to the orchestra , but at the end of the very end , he had a terrible sound .
and he was really excited that this was a mouse that was broken .
but that &apos;s not true .
and what happened was that it was just the experience .
he experienced the experience .
he also had a 20 @-@ minute hearing competition .
but now it &apos;s a little bit smaller , because the late spring leaves a memory , which is that bad memory , and the other 20 @-@ minute winner is completely forgotten .
it tells us that we are thinking about ourselves and other people , and we are using two self .
the first one is self @-@ experience , and the self can live in the present , and the idea of the present , but basically he &apos;s only the present .
it &apos;s about the experience of being a doctor -- like , when the doctor asked you , do you touch me when you touch me here ?
the other self was a memory , and he was responsible for recording his life , and he was looking for him , and he asked him , how did he feel about it recently ?
or is it fun to go to Italy , to look like this ?
self @-@ exploration and memory are very different , and the combination of these two is the cause of happiness .
memory itself is about telling stories .
the story starts with the memory -- the actual time upload .
it &apos;s not the story we &apos;re telling .
it &apos;s our memories telling stories that it &apos;s the stories that we ingest from our experience .
let me start with one example .
this is an old study .
some of the real patients are going to get a cure .
details are no longer details about it , but it &apos;s not such a hard way to do it in the early &apos; 90s .
the patients have to report their pain exponentially .
here are two patients . this is their record .
I ask you , who is the most suffering in them ?
it &apos;s very simple .
clearly , the patient is a patient , and he &apos;s got a long <unk> , and the patient &apos;s <unk> is feeling B , and it &apos;s longer .
but there &apos;s another problem : do these patients think they &apos;re suffering ?
here &apos;s a little accident .
and the amazing thing is that the patient &apos;s memory of a tree is worse than the patient .
these two anecdotes are different stories , the end of the story .
both stories don &apos;t spark intelligence -- but obviously they &apos;re different .
one of them obviously felt worse than the other .
it &apos;s worse , and it &apos;s not a good story in the end .
how do we know that ?
because we asked them at the end , and we asked them one more time , how do you get the full sense of the <unk> of the <unk> ?
it turns out that A &apos;s memories are obviously worse than B.
now this is a direct conflict between self and memory .
from the self &apos;s point of view , the patient is clearly a struggle .
so what the patient is explaining is how we actually do a clinical trial , and when the experiment is finished , we get the results of expected outcomes , and in fact we can extend the patient &apos;s time to a patient and then we can slow it down .
the patient still hurts , but it &apos;s a lot of it .
if you keep doing that , you &apos;re going to make the patient &apos;s experience worse , but the patient &apos;s memory is much better , because you give the patient a good story , a good memory .
how do you define a story ?
and remember the story is true , and the stories we tell are true .
the story depends on the ups and the end of the day .
at the end of it is very important , and the story is dominated by the end .
now , experience itself depends on this experience .
he had a moment of experience , one after another .
and you say , &quot; Well , what &apos;s going on here ? what &apos;s wrong with this ? &quot;
the answer is simple . they &apos;re never going to disappear .
most of our lives -- I &apos;ll just take a second -- I &apos;ll just take a second -- and that means that about three seconds in a lifetime , about five days in a month , three days in a month . they &apos;ll never leave a trail .
most of them are completely ignored .
however , you are now going to find some feeling stored , because the moment we experience it all together into our lives .
as long as we live , we consume these limited resources .
it &apos;s very important how you use them , but it &apos;s not the story of self .
so memory itself and experience are very different .
the big difference is how they process time .
it &apos;s self @-@ experience , and if you have a vacation , the first week is as happy as the first week , the amount of happy is twice a week of vacation .
but it &apos;s not the same for memory .
for the self , two weeks after the vacation was worth more than a week because there was no new memories involved in it .
the story is still not good .
so time is the key to self @-@ recognition and self @-@ experience , and time is not big .
it &apos;s not just memory and telling stories .
it &apos;s also a matter of making a decision , because if your patient has been through two different surgeons who have done a different type of description , and now deciding to check from one of them , and the patient &apos;s selection is going to feel better , and that is how the doctor chooses .
self @-@ experience is <unk> .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between two and two experiences ; we choose between two different experiences .
and when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think about it in the form of experience .
we &apos;re presenting the future in memories .
in general , you can see that memory itself is a tyrant , you can imagine that memory itself is pulling away from the experience , that he is the experience to pull the experience out .
I have an idea that , when we get too close , there &apos;s a big part of our ego for memory .
I think it &apos;s kind of like a <unk> .
how much memory do we use ?
it can explain how memory can be the dominant self .
it reminds me of a vacation I spent a couple of years at the South Pole , which is one of my greatest <unk> , and I often think of this vacation .
it took me about a three @-@ week trip , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , as I opened the mirror , there are about 600 photographs in it , and I might take an hour to reflect .
three weeks of the week was using only one and a half @-@ hour recall .
it seems like a bit of a distraction .
it &apos;s a little bit of a distraction , because I remember it &apos;s a really brief , but even if you remember that there &apos;s a real problem here , why do we use memory more than we do ?
so I want you to think about an experiment about thinking .
if you take the next vacation , if you know the end of the vacation you &apos;re going to be destroyed , and you &apos;re also going to be relieved of a drug to keep you away .
do you think about the same vacation ?
if you choose a different kind of vacation between your two selves , you &apos;re going to get conflicting ideas , which is not very easy , because if you &apos;re only going to get one answer if you &apos;re going to get another answer .
why is it that we are not alone , and the problem is that we have to choose between two selves .
now , two selves have different beliefs about happiness .
these two beliefs correspond to two self @-@ worth of happiness .
so you say , how happy is it ? how happy is it ?
and you say , &quot; How happy is it ? how happy is it ? &quot;
the process of happiness is complex .
how does emotion measure ?
and by the way , we now have a rough notion of self over time .
and the feeling of the memory itself is completely irrelevant .
it &apos;s not a question of how happy it is .
it &apos;s a question of how happy it is .
radically different perceptions .
and if you can &apos;t tell the difference between those two ideas , I can &apos;t afford to pursue happiness , which is why .
in recent years , self @-@ sustaining happiness and self @-@ sustaining relationships between what they &apos;re currently trying to do , at the moment .
the Gallup world recently held a poll that was asked about a million people around the world , and that was how they looked at their life and how they looked at it , and in addition to that , the company did another survey .
in recent years , we &apos;ve learned about two kinds of happy messages .
I think what we &apos;re learning is the difference between the two .
you can tell if one is happy about life , but you can &apos;t tell you how happy they are , and vice .
just to give you an idea of the connection , it &apos;s about 50 percent related .
it means when you see someone , you &apos;re told that his dad has high @-@ tech , you know how tall this guy is ?
well , you might have a basic idea , but very uncertain .
you can &apos;t make a decision .
if I were to say somebody had a rate of their life , he would play eight to 10 percent , and you wouldn &apos;t have experience how happy they were .
so the correlation is very low .
we know what makes people happy .
we know that money is important , it &apos;s important .
we know that happiness is something that happens to us through the people that we love , and that is to spend time and spend their time at the same time .
there are other factors , but that &apos;s the main factor .
so if you want to make both self @-@ happy , you have to get rid of the <unk> and do something different .
I mean , at least we shouldn &apos;t be thinking of pleasure as a living thing .
that &apos;s the difference .
now , one of the reasons why we can &apos;t understand the essence of happiness is that we see life differently than we do .
so when you ask people in California how happy they are , you can &apos;t get the right answer .
because when you do that , you think it &apos;s going to be happy , and you live in Ohio .
when you think about how happy it is in California , you think about the difference between California and other <unk> , like climate .
it turns out that climate conditions are not important , and it &apos;s not too important for thinking about itself .
now , since the actual self @-@ dominated , some people might have come up with a conclusion like this , it &apos;s moving to California .
they &apos;re moving to California for a better life , and they &apos;re tracking their progress , which is a very interesting thing .
their experience is not going to be happier .
we all know that .
but when something happens , they feel like they &apos;re happy , because when they think about it , they think about the state of Ohio , and they think about the right decisions .
it &apos;s really hard to understand how happy life is , I hope I have you a basic idea of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you for your talk . I have a question to ask you .
thank you very much for your talk .
a few weeks ago , we had a telephone , and you heard about a very interesting phenomenon that you &apos;d learned from a Gallup poll .
can you share it with us ? we have a couple of minutes .
Daniel <unk> : okay .
I found a very interesting number from the Gallup world that I &apos;d found , which was surprising .
we found a phenomenon about self @-@ experience .
that &apos;s how much people feel about their income .
and it turns out , for those of us who are less than a year in the United States , this is a big part of the year , almost six million people , who are very well @-@ behaved , and these are more than 60 million a year .
that &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
less than five percent of the year &apos;s population are unhappy , and the less money they are .
and when you have more than 60,000 , we get a standard .
it &apos;s very rare to see such flat lines .
obviously , money is not going to be able to get a sense of self @-@ experience , but it &apos;s not money that &apos;s going to give you a sense of what &apos;s going on , and we know very well .
for another self , memory itself , you have a narrative that &apos;s not so good .
the more you make , the better you are .
it &apos;s not related to emotions .
but Danny , life , liberty and pursuit of happiness is the goal of all Americans struggle .
if you look at this carefully , it &apos;s going to turn our intrinsic notions of , like , the policies and so on .
is it possible that the political characters in this country might look like this and <unk> ?
<unk> : I think there are people who understand the status of happiness in terms of policies .
but this is an insight that we can see in the United States , and it &apos;s not obvious , but in the U.K. , it &apos;s going to be giving birth to other countries .
people are starting to understand that in terms of alternative policies , it &apos;s going to be about pleasure .
it &apos;s going to take a while , but people are going to start thinking about it , and what they &apos;re going to do is they &apos;re going to experience life , and so quickly , we &apos;re going to understand this .
it &apos;s about doing happiness , it &apos;s a whole bunch of other ways , but it &apos;s about how you think about yourself , or about yourself .
and I think within a few years , this will affect policy .
America has done a tremendous amount of effort to measure the pleasant experience .
I think that in 10 years or 20 years , this will be part of the national statistics .
it &apos;s going to be the most strategic argument for me in the next few years .
thank you very much for creating behavioral economics .
thank you very much , Daniel <unk> .
my name is <unk> , and I &apos;m a game designer .
I &apos;ve been working on online dating for 10 years , and the goal of the decade is to make it as simple as playing online games .
now , I &apos;m going to explain to you why I &apos;m saying that , if people have a bigger , bigger game , and of course all of you in this room , and spend more time in the game , you think I &apos;m going to explain more persuasive .
people who are using online gaming today are now going to hit a billion hours a week , and people who are now using online gaming , over a billion hours a week .
some of you might feel like you spend so much time playing games .
maybe there &apos;s a lot more , because there &apos;s a lot of pressing problems that we need to deal with .
but , based on the research that I have in the future , we spend a lot less time playing games .
the $ 3 billion game in the world is far less likely than 30 billion a week in real life .
in fact , I think we need to be better at surviving on the planet , and in fact , I think we need a lot of games to survive on the planet .
I used to calculate , and the time we needed was <unk> billion hours a week .
maybe it &apos;s counterintuitive , but I &apos;d like to repeat this idea to you , so that if we want to address things like hunger , poverty , global climate change , obesity , global conflict , I believe that we need to be encouraged to play online , and at least 10 years , that &apos;s going to happen .
well , I &apos;m serious , not kidding .
it &apos;s interpretation , and it &apos;s about recognizing that play is very important for human race to the future . it &apos;s really important .
this is a portrait made by Franz <unk> .
he wanted to capture some of the emotional changes in play , so he put photography in front of the game .
this is a classic expression of a player .
now , if you &apos;re not a game player , you &apos;re not going to experience the actual significance in this picture .
you might feel that pressing , pressing , psychological fear , not mental <unk> , or concentrate , are trying to solve a problem .
if you &apos;re a game player , you get a sense of the various angles around the corner of the eye , the fold of the eye , the same alignment of the <unk> around you , and it &apos;s a very optimistic sign , and the left is the sign of the eyebrow .
what that means is that the player is going to get a epic victory in the game .
you &apos;ve heard the word &quot; good , &quot; which means that some of you are a game player .
this extraordinary gift is a result , but it &apos;s very exciting before you get this victory , and you never even think of it as a success .
it &apos;s even beyond your imagination .
and when you do that , you will be struck by your skills , which is what &apos;s called the &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> . &quot;
and the player is going to do that .
at the same time , this is in the Solomon Islands , and what we &apos;re looking forward to is the face of a global number of problems that we can &apos;t get anywhere in the world .
now , unfortunately , when we deal with various aspects of our everyday life , what we tend to see is this expression .
I usually call this a &quot; <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s not good for my life , but it &apos;s actually this one that I did , and it &apos;s good to see .
and that &apos;s what I did for a living , and it was not very good at making a facial appearance .
and this is a historical community that I studied in California , and I read my Ph.D. at Berkeley , and I read Dr. <unk> , which is why we think that virtual reality is better than the real world .
and it &apos;s also a huge puzzle for a lot of players .
we feel like we cannot adapt to real life in games .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s adaptive ; it &apos;s not a part of a positive dish .
we do have a lot more success in the world , but here &apos;s the preparation of internal motivation and collaboration and collaboration and collaboration .
when we &apos;re in the game , I think we can do the best , and when we see a message , we can help other people , and we can solve the problem , we can stand up , we can stand up and we continue to work .
but in reality , when we &apos;re faced with failure , when we &apos;re faced with a barrier of obstacles , we don &apos;t often feel like that .
we tend to feel overwhelmed , anxious , anxious , anxious , divorced or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
we don &apos;t have a game at the time , and we don &apos;t feel it in the game .
and this is what I study when I was in graduate school .
can the game make us think , can we do anything ?
how can we move that feeling out of a game into a real society ?
so , I studied some of the games like World of Warcraft , which are the ideal for cooperation .
and I noticed something about these things that make epic triumph possible in online play .
the first thing is , whenever you appear in these online games , particularly in World of Warcraft games , there &apos;s a lot of different roles that will be very trusted and will help you to save the world .
but it &apos;s not all the missions look like this , and it &apos;s just that match your current level .
so you have the power to do it .
designers won &apos;t give you a mission you can &apos;t do right now .
but to do that task is necessary for your ability to limit , so you have to do everything you can , and in Warcraft , everybody has a position .
there was no audience there that had always been a very special and important thing to do .
and there are a lot of people in the world who can work together .
everywhere you go , there will be thousands of people waiting for you to work with you to do the necessary task .
it &apos;s not that easy in real life to feel like we have thousands of partners in our fingertips in real life .
there &apos;s a wonderful story about the game , and these plots attract us , and motivating us .
and at the same time , any effort we &apos;ve made has a positive response .
you &apos;ve heard about the rise , the rise , the ability to raise the level , to add more intelligence .
and we don &apos;t have that kind of back in life .
for example , when I walk down this stage , I don &apos;t have the ability to speak up , my crazy ideas are more than 20 @-@ plus .
in reality , I didn &apos;t get any reward .
in the midst of cyber warfare , like &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; is a very handy thing to do because we can win the final triumph of World of Warcraft , and that &apos;s because we &apos;re not going to win the game .
because it &apos;s better than reality .
until recently , the game &quot; World of Warcraft &quot; has spent countless millions of years trying to solve all kinds of online problems that we have in our society , to solve all the virtual problems in our society .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
but it sounds like a bad thing .
we wrote these numbers : eight million years ago , our ancestors evolved to walk upright .
this is the first primate that we &apos;re walking .
so when we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend on games , the only way that makes this reasonable understanding is : think about how much time we spend in human evolution and how much time it is .
and to think about it is the right thing , because you can see that playing games with a lot of time , we can change how we are , and we can change how we are .
we are moving towards a more cooperative and robust species .
it &apos;s true , I believe .
this is a very interesting survey , which was published by a researcher at the Carnegie Mellon University , in a very strong atmosphere , today young people in a game , in a very strong atmosphere , in which today the young people are now 21 years old , on average , on average , on average , on average , on average , on average .
now , 10,000 hours is a very interesting value because of two reasons .
first of all , American children from fifth grade to high school are <unk> hours , and of course you have to do well on time .
we have a parallel processing data which shows that young people are doing a good game , and they spend more time in school learning about what they &apos;re doing .
some of you have probably read the new book &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
so your views on success are not that strange , 10,000 hours of success .
the rule of law is based on cognitive science , and if we spend 10,000 hours in the age of 21 , we can do something else , and then we can get a big success in these things .
we &apos;re going to become world experts in everything we do .
now , what we &apos;re looking at is the full generation of young people .
the big question is , what are the players doing ? what are the players doing ?
if we can give the answer to the answer , we will uncover an unprecedented human capital .
they are the ones that we have today that spend at least an hour playing online games .
they &apos;re all performing gifted ; five billion people are good at something .
there are more than a billion people in the next decade who are really good at creating a game .
if I haven &apos;t been told , this is what &apos;s going on .
the game industry has always been developing , and since today , its outreach , and the change from the Internet to the wireless Internet to wireless Internet , online players around the world , particularly from India , China , Brazil , Brazil , can be in the same platform .
in the next decade , there will be a billion new players in it .
we &apos;re going to have a 15 @-@ year @-@ old game player .
so I started thinking very early , where are these games going to lead us ?
I think there are four things about this , and the first is the positive , the optimistic one .
think of it as the extreme self @-@ inspiring .
the positive spirit of the longing is a combination of the urge to solve immediately .
the gamers always believe that the win of the impossible is possible .
the gamers are not isolated .
they &apos;re very good at creating social structures .
a very interesting survey showed that we prefer people who play with us , and even if they beat me , it &apos;s the same .
and the reason is that , in the course of the game , we accumulate the trust , and the reason is that in the game , we accumulate the trust .
the reason we believe that is because they spend the same time doing the same rules with the same rules , we &apos;re going to fight shoulder @-@ to @-@ shoulder , until the game ends .
in this case , games can indeed build <unk> , trust and cooperation .
and we will build a more robust social network .
happy productivity , I love that .
&quot; the average World of Warcraft &quot; takes 22 hours a week , and it &apos;s partly as a game .
it &apos;s because , when we play games , we &apos;re having a little more fun playing games , or if you &apos;re playing a game .
as humans , we like to do things that are hard , but it &apos;s much more interesting .
if you can give the right task to play the player , they keep playing .
and finally , it &apos;s a comic book .
the game player likes to carry on in the work of the human story .
any little bit of action that you &apos;re doing is going to be a part of that ultimate vision , which is that you &apos;ve all heard of Wikipedia , the largest <unk> of all the world around the world , a virtually open , many people together .
the second largest <unk> in the world is &quot; <unk> World of Warcraft , &quot; about 80,000 articles .
every month , 500 million people are using it .
it &apos;s about the &quot; World of Warcraft &quot; of Warcraft .
it &apos;s a very beautiful story .
it &apos;s also very well known as &quot; World of Warcraft . &quot;
and this is the example of bringing those four superpowers into one thing : players are a highly empowering , hopeful group .
they all think they have the power to change the world , and they all think they have the power to change the world .
but the problem is that they believe that they can change the world , not the virtual world .
that &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to do .
there was a man called <unk> .
his work is extraordinary . he studies how people spend so much time and energy and money on online play .
he said , &quot; Look , we &apos;re seeing a large number of people living in virtual worlds and game play .
because he was an economist , he was rational .
he said ...
unlike me , I &apos;m just a game designer , I &apos;m full of energy .
and he said , &quot; Well , play makes sense , because games get more in the virtual world than in real life . &quot;
they can have better social relationships in the video game , and they can get better outcomes than real life &apos;s real life .
so , he said that for the game players , spend more time in the virtual world than in reality .
now I still think that &apos;s rational .
but anyway , this is not the best option .
we have to start building real society from the present to a game .
so I got some inspiration from something that happened 25 years ago .
these are old postcards of <unk> , made of sheep &apos;s joints .
before we designed the game , we had the creation of a sheep &apos;s wood .
this is the first game that humans designed .
if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian , you &apos;ll understand what the history of this game was invented and what it was .
the night watchman had played a game in particular , a game that had been invented in the West .
clearly , the history of history had been so severe that the king decided to do something that they had to do .
people were suffering , they were fighting .
it &apos;s a very crisis . they need an extreme solution .
according to the <unk> , they invented the Christmas game and created a policy across the nation , where everybody could eat , but the next day , everybody could play a game .
people are interested in playing dice because games are powerful enough for us to sink our happiness in such a self @-@ fulfilling act , and people forget the fact that they don &apos;t have food .
the next day , people were playing with games , and the next day they were going to eat .
it &apos;s been said that the people in the United States have spent 18 years eating one day , playing a game , and they were able to get a great famine .
this is how we see games today .
we are suffering from games .
we use games for avoiding physical , for example , for things that are not good , for what we need .
and this process can be done forever .
it &apos;s very exciting .
according to <unk> , in 18 years , the big famine had no improvement , and the king decided to play the last game .
he divided the nation into two groups .
together , they play a game with the winning of dice , and they &apos;re going to lead to a kind of adventure .
they &apos;re going to go out and find a new place to stay , and they &apos;re going to be able to live in a world where they &apos;re going to leave , and they &apos;re going to be able to spread , damaged by the collective <unk> of civilization .
it sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but recently , DNA evidence shows the ancestors of the Roman Empire -- the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
scientists have recently discovered the crazy story , which has historically been done .
geologists also figured out the evidence that there was a global climate that had been boiled down for 20 years , and that would explain that the Big Bang came .
so , this seemingly crazy story is real .
they passed the game to keep their culture and they were able to hide from the game for 18 years , and they were able to get their hands out of game play , and they were able to save the entire civilization through this kind of way .
we can do it in this way .
people started in 1994 , and of course they did .
this is the first real @-@ time game in the World of Warcraft .
the ancient universe played the dice for 18 years , and we played them for 16 years .
so I &apos;m saying that we are ready to accept a game that will change our lives .
this is the discovery of one half of the civilization that &apos;s held in the new world , and we now have a game of <unk> billion hours .
let alone half of us play games every hour until we can get to the real world .
you might ask , how can we solve the problems that we &apos;re doing in the game ? well , this is what I &apos;ve been working on for the last couple of years , what I &apos;ve been working on , and what I &apos;ve been working on in is called the <unk> Institute .
this is an ad that we &apos;re in our office , and it gives us a view of how we think about the future .
we don &apos;t try to predict the future .
but we &apos;re going to create the future .
we used to think about the best and then we tried to get people to make the vision reality .
we want to live in epic glory , and we give people a way to win .
I want to give you a brief overview of all the games that I do , and they &apos;re all trying to give people the future to make their own epic winning and offer some ways to do something .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
this was done in 2007 .
this is a online game that gives you a sense of the lack of oil .
the lack of oil is a fiction , but we &apos;re going to have a lot of content in it , and you &apos;re going to think that &apos;s true , and it &apos;s going to make you feel like we don &apos;t have oil exposure in real life , so when you open the game up , let &apos;s tell us what &apos;s going to happen in real time .
in 2007 , we had estimated 17 million people participate in this game , and we tracked these people for the next three years .
I can tell you that this is a very inspiring experience .
nobody wants to change their life , or because they think it &apos;s rude to the environment , or it &apos;s because they feel it <unk> .
but if you allow them to experience an amazing experience and tell them , we &apos;ve already run out of oil .
it &apos;s going to be a wonderful story that you &apos;ve heard of and amazing experiences .
to challenge yourself , to see how you can live , most of the players , to keep them in play , most of the players in the game , to keep their habit of forming .
in the next game of saving the world , our choices are harder than the oil shortage .
we &apos;re working on a game called <unk> , and we &apos;re setting up a game called <unk> , and we &apos;re doing a game called <unk> .
the assumption of this game is that supercomputer has been calculated that the human remains 23 years on Earth .
this supercomputer was called : the global extinction projection system .
people were playing a film like a Jerry <unk> .
you all know , <unk> &apos;s film , you build a four @-@ year @-@ old <unk> where you have an astronaut , scientist , who have a group of skills to save the world .
in the game we designed , we didn &apos;t have five groups of five , we designed it to be a team of people , and your responsibility is to develop the energy , food , healthcare , security , all the social security .
we have 8,000 people playing this game for eight weeks .
they concluded 500 crazy , but creative solutions , if you could go online and go to Google for &quot; <unk> , &quot; you could see the results .
and the last game that we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to launch it in March , <unk> , which is a game done with the World Bank .
if you can do this , you will get the World Bank approval of the World Bank , which is the Brazilian innovators in 2010 .
through working with sub @-@ Saharan Africa , we are inviting them to participate in social innovation .
games are more like a cartoon fiction . we have an equilibrium with skill , such as deep learning , knowledge , vision , vision , etc .
I &apos;m inviting all of you to take this game and share it to young people everywhere in the world , and particularly in the developing world , this game can connect people together , and let them think about their own social enterprises , that will hopefully benefit from the game .
I &apos;m going to end my talk .
I want to ask a question .
what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
we have so many good players , and we play these games that may be the kind of experiment that we &apos;re going to do in the future , but nothing has ever been saved .
I hope you will agree with me that the player is a huge human @-@ powered <unk> , and we can get them to work in the real world , because of that , play is a very powerful innovation platform .
we have all these wonderful superpowers , happy productive , organized social structure and immediate aspirations of contemporary and meaningful contexts .
I &apos;m really hoping that we can play together in the next century on this planet .
I want you to join us to make or to support these games .
when I &apos;m looking forward to the next 10 years , I &apos;m very sure that first of all , we can create any future that we can imagine , and second , we can play any game we want to play .
let &apos;s start with the game to change the world .
thank you .
I want to share with you a couple of months ago a big discovery that I was working on as an Italian magazine article .
when I was writing , I was always putting a dictionary next to me , and I was writing the article , and I realized that I had never been found in a dictionary in my life that I had never found a particular language .
let me read this in a very constructive fashion .
twenty @-@ five tablets of paralysis , the <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> , of <unk> ,
conversely , strong , empowered , empowered .
I read all this content to my friend , and I started laughing at it , and it was so absurd that when I was <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and I had to stop my words and get <unk> and get back to the point of being <unk> .
and yes , my old <unk> , I think , is a very old version of this .
but in fact , it was the &apos; 80s , and I was supposed to make a difference in the context of my family , and with the kids around me and the world .
thank God I had never done a dictionary .
what I mean by that is that , through the winning of disability in a dictionary , I can tell you that the world I live in doesn &apos;t recognize the physical world that I live in , and the disabled world thinks that we have absolutely zero @-@ sum factors , and today , I &apos;m currently bringing a chance of life and despair .
so , I immediately went online , I looked at the <unk> of disabled , in 2009 , the explanation that I was looking forward to seeing some important change .
I &apos;m going to show you a new version of the <unk> <unk> disabled .
unfortunately , the explanation was not so much better than that .
and the two words &quot; As near the opposite &quot; -- especially , I &apos;m very busy with them : the whole , the sound of a <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s not just a few words .
when people use that negative vocabulary , they actually reflect the view of the disability .
what was remarkable about the difference in the context of the disabled , the people inside them , and the process of these values .
our language affects our mind and our way of looking at the world and looking at others .
in fact , there are so many ancient societies , like the ancient world , that believe that speech is heavy because when it &apos;s said , it &apos;s true .
so , what kind of thing do we want is a person without the power , or a person with the power ?
sometimes , we &apos;re just going to name an adult or a child , but we &apos;re going to be able to tell them what they &apos;re going to do , put them on their own terms , giving them their ability to question their own capabilities .
don &apos;t we want to open their hearts ?
I had this guy in my life , and I opened my heart door , and he was a doctor when I was a kid , and he was a doctor at the Scripps Institute .
his name is <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s an Italian @-@ American , obviously , because his name is so hard that he calls him &quot; <unk> &quot; and he &apos;s right .
he was always a <unk> , and he was a <unk> , and he was a very well @-@ educated , so he was with the kids .
in addition to training courses , I spent a lot of my time in his hospital .
I &apos;m going to use that kind of <unk> , rich , flexible tape that I &apos;m going to do over and over and over and over again , I &apos;m going to do two @-@ wheeler with <unk> and even giving them a name .
when I was five years old , I was a five @-@ year @-@ old kid , and I asked him not to give me the <unk> , which , of course , I did not succeed .
and one day , David <unk> , I looked at me as I was , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and he said to me , Amy , you &apos;re such a strong little girl , and I felt that you could tie these things up one day .
when you broke , I reward you for 100 dollars .
obviously , this is a trick that David <unk> , who was trying to get me to do all these things that I couldn &apos;t really do , which was to turn up all the rich men in the ICU room for five years , to seduce me , but P physicians , which made a difference that I hate to translate into a whole new life and a whole new experience .
today , I &apos;ve always been thinking about how big my own strong , strong , strong , strong , strong , strong little girl , who &apos;s been in my own self @-@ aware , and I &apos;ve been able to realize that my inner vision is <unk> , my future is a light .
and this is a very good example of the mathematics of P , which suggests that an adult with power can light up a child &apos;s potential .
but in a more recent case , our language does not allow us to turn what we want to see and not allow the physical disability to realize that they are actually capable of capable .
the technology has developed , and our language has not evolved over time with society .
of course , from the medical perspective , my own version , fixing the <unk> of my vision , the gold @-@ plated <unk> of the elderly , the <unk> of these technologies that allow people to be able to use their own capabilities and extend the limitations of the natural world and allow them to be able to allow them to be a global platform within the global commons .
so , technology is clearly showing us a permanent truth , which is that every single one of us is very powerful and will contribute to social and adaptive in our society .
it &apos;s very interesting to talk about the human context , because people want me to get me through this talk about the subject of today that I want to make a point of approaching some of the people that I &apos;m trying to accomplish , that I &apos;m not going to let other people realize that I &apos;m going to be a little bit wrong about this .
and the idea of transcendence in adversity , which is success , or happiness is at the end of a difficult experience , and the experience itself is not about success and pleasure , and it &apos;s not about being able to be a life , because I &apos;ve been around with an amputation , and a series of obstacles that seem to me as a challenge to me .
but in fact , these challenges really change us , and within our journey , the reflective markers on the Earth that may be on the body , possible in the spirit , and possibly both .
I want to say that the challenge is good .
in the face of the <unk> , we shouldn &apos;t think of it as obstacles that we can carry on .
indeed , adversity is part of our lives .
I imagined adversity as my own shadow .
sometimes it looks big , but it &apos;s still everywhere I go .
of course , I &apos;m not trying to <unk> people &apos;s values and meaning and solidarity .
we are destined to experience the struggle of our lives , and each of us is , but the problems that we care about are not whether you &apos;re going to go to the brink of <unk> , but how we &apos;re going to face it .
so , our responsibility is not simply to let people care about the things that we care about in terms of culture , but to allow them to form the innate ability to thrive .
when we allow our kids to feel like we don &apos;t have a adaptive capability , we actually hurt them .
the objective of medicine is that I &apos;m contemplating whether I &apos;m a disability at the heart of a disabled society , I think about whether I &apos;m alone , and I have a huge difference between the two .
in fact , one of the only problems I have to deal with is the world &apos;s understanding of the injustice and the description of all of my injustice .
we want to be able to protect the people that we care about , and we &apos;re going to take the <unk> , we &apos;re going to tell them , or sometimes , to make predictions about their lives , but we have to pay attention to whether we &apos;re going to destroy these people .
perhaps , people have been focused only on their flaws and trying to figure out how to fix these flaw , and to the extent that the physical disability is more serious than the physical disability itself .
we don &apos;t see disability at the whole level , and we don &apos;t admit that it &apos;s very difficult for them to be in their own situation .
we can effectively estimate the value of a society .
so our eyes shouldn &apos;t be limited to the physical condition of the disabled , but they should be aware of the value of being human .
and also , the most important part of the physical disability is the connection between human creativity .
so , the tough years of struggle is not to devalue , not to mention , not to do anything we need to do or to hide , and in contrast , we should be looking for opportunities in our <unk> .
in fact , what I want to tell you about is the struggle of adversity , not the ability to overcome the problem , but to embrace it and to hold it back to the top , and even to dance , to dance .
maybe , if we can think of torture as something natural , human @-@ made , human @-@ made , it could be something that wasn &apos;t affordable to us .
this year , we celebrated the 50th anniversary of Darwin , and when Darwin wrote the evolution of the species 150 years ago , he suggested a true truth about human traits .
he said that the phrase that he meant was that the species that could survive are often not the strongest , not the most clever , but most adaptive .
conflict is the mother of creation .
Darwin and all of your heroes have revealed this transformation , which is that human survival has suffered from a very intense fear of human soul .
and I &apos;ll repeat that again , the greatest human ability is transformation and adapt .
maybe , before we get there , we don &apos;t know what it is .
it &apos;s possible that this is a step in adversity , a sense of self and individual ability .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of adversity as an opportunity to change .
it &apos;s not a difficult time .
torture is a change , and we just haven &apos;t been able to adapt to it .
I think the biggest dilemma that we &apos;ve created is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
well , what is the status quo ?
there is no justice .
I know what the average <unk> is , what is a typical <unk> , but I don &apos;t know what is a regulated utility , if there is such a poor , liberal , <unk> , would you be interested in them ?
I don &apos;t think about it .
if we don &apos;t invest in the right capital , we invest in finding all kinds of possibilities , to discover all kinds of abilities , to take care of the potential of many children , to motivate them to be much better , and they &apos;re going to empower them , to contribute to their communities .
anthropologists tell us that we are always wanting to be in the community , and that people in the community are useful is the ability to contribute .
and what happened was that , at the age of 60,000 years ago , the Neanderthals were a very good proof that they had raised in their society , because they believed that older people were more likely to live , and that the whole society was valuable .
older people are never seen as useless , they &apos;re considered a very valuable .
a few years ago , I was in my hometown of <unk> , Pennsylvania , where I was standing next to a <unk> tomato .
because it was summer , I was wearing shorts .
and there was a man in behind me that said , well , isn &apos;t that Amy <unk> <unk> ?
I turned around and I found a <unk> that I didn &apos;t know .
and I said , Mr. <unk> , I &apos;m sorry , we &apos;ve met ? I &apos;ve got a <unk> .
he said , &quot; Well , you don &apos;t remember when we met .
because at the time , I was taking you out of your mother &apos;s uterus and <unk> you .
that &apos;s what I found .
and I thought , of course , that was the end .
this guy is a doctor , and I just learned this story through my mother , that I was a late night , and I was alone for two weeks .
it was at the time that my mother would take care of her doctor during the course of the day , and that was the end of the day that he knew that he had not seen before .
when I was born , I had no <unk> , my toes , and Father Keene had to deliver two bad things .
he said to me , &quot; I published the diagnosis and told my parents that you would never walk , you would never walk like that , you would never live your life forever , and you &apos;d never been able to live it since .
and Mr. Teszler did a great thing , and he began to take all the press from my childhood , all the stories about me , including me when I was in second grade , in a graduate student of medical school , and all the students in my medical school , and all the lessons I had done in my school , I had done in my life .
he called me these stories called the X factor in his course called the <unk> of the human mind .
there is no medical diagnostic to explain how powerful this will be , how big will influence a human life .
and Father Keene said to me , even though there are many times other people answered my point , as my experience of being a child , even though very little of the support they could achieve .
see , the doctor &apos;s idea changed .
he realized that there was a difference between medical treatment and a human process .
for a few years , my idea has a transformation , which is , if you ask me when I was 15 years old , if I want to use my current prosthetic hand , I &apos;d like to have a full @-@ weight return .
because I wanted to get that kind of proper <unk> .
but if you ask me the same question today , I &apos;m going to get up .
and that &apos;s because the experience that I use with the prosthetic device is very important to me .
maybe , I &apos;m out of my head because , in the people that I meet , I &apos;m opening up the door to the new world more than I can put my head down .
see , what you need is a person who can show you the power .
the human soul is embracing , and if you can give other people a key , make him use this key and you can use that key at the moment , you can turn it into a door , you can open it to somebody else , and you can open the door in the best way to educate them .
because you &apos;re teaching them to open up the door to the new world .
in fact , the <unk> education , the meaning of the word &quot; costume &quot; comes from the word &quot; <unk> .
the left is the <unk> , the potential to discover everything inside .
so what is the potential for our potential ?
there was a case in the 1960s , the British children from primary school to secondary school .
in the U.K. , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the United States , we call it <unk> <unk> .
the exam students divided from grades to Point A , B , C , D .
there &apos;s a better teacher , etc .
and this is a three @-@ month @-@ old trial , followed by a student called D , and they were told they were an A , and they were told that they were very clever , three months of experiment , and this group of students ended up being the equivalent of a <unk> .
and of course , this case also has a flip side to it , and that is that those who are supposed to be called A @-@ B are told that they &apos;re D @-@ C @-@ D .
three months of experiments ended .
many of them have been dropped .
and one of the key points for this experiment was that the teachers who got involved were not there .
the teachers don &apos;t know that the students are lined up .
the teachers were just being told what is A , what is D teacher , what is it ?
so , I think that true physical disability is a soul that has been beaten , a soul that has no hope for the future , a soul that can &apos;t feel a good soul , a soul that has lost our natural imagination .
if we can get the human spirit out there , we want the soul to see the love and the beauty of others , and the imagination and the imagination and the imagination in a very good way .
as long as a soul still has those qualities , it can create endless possibilities and new lifestyles .
I want to leave you with a poem by a poet named <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a friend of mine , an Jacques Cousteau , an Jacques Cousteau called &quot; <unk> , &quot; a God who knows all four words , &quot; each child knows that God knows that there is not a name , but will not be a four @-@ word .
dancing with me ! <unk> Thank you .
I want you to imagine a wearable robot that can give you a superhero , or let the wheelchair get up again .
we call these robots in Berkeley .
there &apos;s nothing else you can do in the morning , and it &apos;s going to give you extra power , and it &apos;s going to help you , like control .
it actually embeds people and machines .
but it &apos;s not only -- it &apos;s putting together and connecting you into other devices .
it &apos;s not just something that doesn &apos;t work .
to show you what we &apos;re doing right now , we &apos;re going to talk about the U.S. military , and they can carry about 100 pounds of weight on their back , and are asked to carry more .
it &apos;s obvious that this leads to some of the most profound problems -- 30 percent of the soldiers with back @-@ to @-@ injury -- chronic <unk> injury .
so we thought we could face this challenge and create an exoskeleton to help solve this problem .
so let me introduce you to the <unk> -- the human body &apos;s body weight .
soldiers : after <unk> an exoskeleton , I can carry 200 pounds of physical terrain .
it &apos;s flexible design that allows people to go deep , to the high @-@ security movement .
it feels what I want to do , where I want to go , and get my strength and endurance .
Arno Penzias : we and our industry and we were ready to introduce this new exoskeleton this year .
it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s turn to the wheelchair , and this is a very personal part .
there are 240 million people in the world .
it &apos;s about one percent of the population .
it &apos;s a very conservative estimate .
what we &apos;re going to say now is that very young people with a spinal cord injury are at the same time -- 20 , 30 years old , 40 years old -- that touch a wheelchair becomes the only choice .
and it &apos;s also making the number multiplied .
and the only choice , roughly -- someone with a stroke or other conditions -- is a wheelchair .
in fact , 500 years ago , this is a very successful introduction , and I have to say .
so , I think we &apos;re going to start writing new platforms .
now let me introduce you to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who had been hurt 19 years ago so that she could not walk for another 19 years , until now .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : thank you .
<unk> : I said , that &apos;s our <unk> .
it has a sensor .
and in these hand @-@ completely saturated sensors , they send signals to the back of her back computer .
at the same time , there was a battery that was consumed by her hip , including her five @-@ wheeler that allowed her to move slowly .
<unk> : I was at the height of my life when I was 24 years old , and I fell asleep and I was paralyzed .
and at that moment , I lost all the sensations in the pelvis and all the activity .
not long after , a doctor comes into my ward and says to me , &quot; You can &apos;t walk anymore . &quot;
that was 19 years ago .
he took every bit of the wish that I was there .
since the days of adaptive technology , I was able to learn how to ski again , climbing , even hand @-@ <unk> .
but nothing made me walk , until now .
thank you .
<unk> : as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and talk about .
it &apos;s in our hands that we have all the potential to change our lives -- not just for the soldiers , but for every human being .
<unk> : thank you .
in New York , I &apos;m the director of the nonprofit sector .
at the same time I eradicate poverty , I was a volunteer fire , and at the same time , I was a conductor conductor .
in our little town , it &apos;s a volunteer place , and you have to go all the way up to where you &apos;re going to be possible .
I remember my first fire .
I &apos;m the second volunteer , and I &apos;m probably going to be able to get into the duet .
but you have to run the other volunteers , first of all , get the work to get you .
and when I was in the end , he was desperate to discuss that she was clearly experiencing the worst day of life .
it was <unk> , and she was standing in her pajamas , <unk> , <unk> , her house was <unk> .
the other volunteers who got to get to the very first , called him the <unk> , the force was distributed , and he was assigned to kill him , to save the dog .
<unk> ! I &apos;m jealous of my gosh .
it &apos;s a lawyer or seven @-@ year @-@ old who can tell other people how deeply he &apos;s going into a living puppy , because he can &apos;t help me .
okay , now I &apos;m going to turn on .
the force is my past .
he said , &quot; <unk> . I need you to learn .
I need you upstairs , I want you to take a <unk> for this woman . &quot;
really , I swear .
it &apos;s not the image that I have in my mind , but I went upstairs , and I went to the bottom , and I went through the &quot; actual <unk> , &quot; and they &apos;ve pulled the fire out of the stairs and took a pair of shoes .
I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m not a hero .
I brought my mission down to the front door , and I met the man who had been there before , and the dog that he had always been .
we brought our treasure to the front door , and there was no accident , and he got more attention than I got .
a few weeks later , we received a letter from the <unk> , and thank our journey to save her family &apos;s life .
she was specifically talking about a small , tiny detail , even someone who had a pair of shoes for her .
whether I &apos;m working in &quot; <unk> , &quot; or I &apos;m a volunteer filmmaking , I see a lot of very generous <unk> , but I also see a man &apos;s courage and compassion .
you know what I learned ?
they &apos;re all equally important .
and when I look around , I look around , and I think that people who are going to succeed or are going to succeed , you have these amazing things that I &apos;m going to tell you : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for you to get the first million to change someone else &apos;s life .
if you have anything , you can give it to it .
it doesn &apos;t feed the poor .
a model .
not every day we have the opportunity to save someone &apos;s life , but every day we have a chance to impact the lives of others .
come on : get those shoes .
thank you .
<unk> : mark , Mark , come back .
thank you .
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival .
in this community , women are dominant , have to have sex , and play is a universal thing -- happy is serious .
no , it &apos;s not about burning men , it &apos;s not about San Francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your close relatives .
this is the world of the bonobos in the Congo .
bonobos are chimps and bonobos mate in all of us .
it means that we all have a common ancestor , a grandmother that had evolved to live about six million years ago .
now , chimps are <unk> by their female .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve been so <unk> about the evolutionary history of human evolution .
but the bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
the chimps are dominated by the bonobos .
the chimps that have learned how to live together have a highly inclusive society in which lethal violence is not yet seen .
but sadly , the bonobos are one of the most known chimps as <unk> .
they live deep inside the jungles of the Congo , so it &apos;s very hard for them .
the Congo is a violent <unk> -- she &apos;s a remarkable biodiversity and beautiful land , but she &apos;s also a dark and violent scene that has taken decades of life in World War I .
and it &apos;s not surprising that this kind of bouncy the chimps are living .
the business of meat and forest destruction meant that we could not provide a small habitat for the only chimpanzee in the world -- we could not even know if there was a small habitat .
however , in this wild , violent and chaos @-@ ridden land you can hear the <unk> dancing flames in the trees .
what are these close relatives ?
we know that they &apos;re &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t kill war , &quot; so they have a very regular sexual pleasure and sexual activity in conflict and social problems .
I &apos;m not saying that this is how we can solve all of the problems -- because play is much more potent for having sex in the chimps .
the bonobos are humans , and they love play throughout their lifetime .
play is not just a kid &apos;s game .
for all of us and for the bonobos , play is the foundation of intimacy and nurturing .
it also allows us to learn about trust and play .
it &apos;s the creation of play , creativity , adaptability , all about diversity -- diversity , diversity , behavior , diversity .
when you look at the chimps at bonobos , you see very evolutionary roots of human evolution , dance and rituals .
play is what keeps us connected .
now I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you two clips that have just been taken from wild to special places .
first of all , this is a rigged game of <unk> -- I don &apos;t mean football .
here , two young females are playing the game .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
it &apos;s probably the origin of the term &quot; She &apos;s playing with his <unk> . &quot;
I just thought he liked it a lot , right ?
yeah .
so it &apos;s good for both chimps and humans .
and this video is really interesting because it proves -- this video is really interesting because it shows how you bring the unusual elements into the game -- like the testes -- how the game can search for trust and nurturing -- and at the same time it turns out to be over 1,000 .
but play is a transformation process .
play is a <unk> process that can become many games , some games that are quiet , imagination , imagination , imagination -- and perhaps magic is found .
I &apos;d like to show you that this is <unk> , a young female chimpanzee who &apos;s playing water .
and I think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries inside us and ourselves .
it &apos;s the pace of play that motivates us to explore , to force us to connect , and then the unexpected connections that we produce are indeed a celebration of creativity .
so this is just the kind of profound insight that the chimps are affected by the bonobos .
but they also have a secret to our future , and in the future we need to adjust to a increasingly challenging world through unprecedented creativity and more collaborative collaboration .
the secret is play is essential for these capabilities .
in other words , play is the universal <unk> of the future .
in order to succeed , we need play .
but are we going to play as much as possible ?
play is not a small one .
play is essential .
for the bonobos , it &apos;s not just about the teeth and the teeth .
it &apos;s not the best way to play , but it &apos;s probably the most demanding of play .
so , my primates , we embrace the gift of a gift that we play together , and that gives us the opportunity to recreate creativity , the relationship and the wonder .
thank you .
I &apos;d like you to imagine that , in the year 1979 , at the same time , every single moment , had a child -- good .
and then the second generation , every parent , has dropped a child .
now , I don &apos;t want you all to be pregnant because if you spend too much time thinking about it , you &apos;re not going to hear me .
so think about it a little bit .
so in this case , I &apos;m going to ask you , what about the sperm that carry the Y chromosome ?
the other is the sperm that carry the X chromosome , carrying the X chromosome .
both of them survived , and they began to grow .
and we &apos;re going to go back to this .
I became both characters in the field that I work on .
one of the roles was my anatomical history .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and what I study is how humans deal with anatomy -- human skin , or animal bodies -- how they deal with body fluids , abstract bodies , how they look at bodies .
the other role is that , as an activist , as a role for the patient -- or , as I say , as a doctor -- I &apos;m a very radical .
and what happened was that , in my work , I was exposed to people who were challenging .
for example , some of the people I was exposed to are <unk> , sharing a body .
there &apos;s also a number of people who are chronically <unk> , who are more generous than they are .
and also , many of the people that I was exposed to , their gender is different -- they don &apos;t have a standard male feature or female signature .
in general , the symptoms can be called <unk> .
there are many forms .
let me just give you a couple of examples where you can both have a non @-@ standard male feature , not a standard female .
one example of one can have four chromosomes and , in the Y chromosome , the <unk> genes on the Y chromosome , have the primitive <unk> of the fetus that makes it the testes .
so at the time of the fetus , the testes causes the hormone .
but this individual lack of the receptor hormone , the body can &apos;t respond to the testes .
it &apos;s called the testes .
so , testosterone has a lot of hormone , but it can &apos;t get a response .
so the body moves toward a female trend .
when the baby was born , she looked like a girl .
she was the girl , and she was raised as a young girl .
most of the time , until the 1960s , when her breasts started to grow , she didn &apos;t have women &apos;s cycles , and we started to wonder what was going to happen .
and so they looked at her , and she didn &apos;t have any ovaries , and in fact , inside her body &apos;s testes , she carried the Y chromosome .
now , there &apos;s a big problem that &apos;s going to tell you that this guy is actually not a son .
women , like men , have an organ called <unk> .
it &apos;s in the back of our body .
it &apos;s also managed to produce testosterone as a male hormone .
like me , most women -- I believe I &apos;m a classic woman -- I don &apos;t know the composition of my chromosomes , but I think I should have a typical female -- most women like me are actually a sensitive female .
we produce testosterone , we respond to it .
as a result , there were women like me , and the brain exposed more testosterone at the time than when she was born , the girl with no testosterone had more testosterone .
so gender is a very complicated thing ; it &apos;s not that the <unk> are between men and women -- in some ways , they can cover the whole range of sexual function .
another example : a couple of years ago , I received this call from a three @-@ year @-@ old boy who was born with a boy named after a boy who had a girlfriend and had a sex with his girlfriend , but recently , he found that he had chicken and <unk> in his body .
all he had was a very extreme condition called the &quot; <unk> &quot; -- 21 .
he &apos;s carrying <unk> chromosomes and he &apos;s active in the womb to create a male hormone .
as a result , he grew up with male <unk> , and his brain received more typical male hormone .
so he was born , and he looked like a boy -- no doubt .
only when he was 19 years old , when he started to meet the biology problem , it happened in the body , and it turned out that , in fact , the inside of him was female .
well , let &apos;s take a quick look at another example of what could possibly be sexual .
some people with <unk> chromosomes develop an organ called <unk> , which is a dental tissue organized by the testes .
we don &apos;t know what causes it .
so gender can be generous .
the children with these physical traits -- whether it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> or <unk> -- are often <unk> -- are not designed for surgeons to be healthy .
because in many cases , their bodies are actually healthy .
they have all kinds of reasons for their procedures because they are threatened by our society .
or there &apos;s a typical physical structure in society that looks like that .
so , our concept is that as a woman , we have to have the character of women , and so on , a black person has to have a body of Africans in your own .
so we had this very simple realization .
and when we &apos;re faced with certain aspects of our bodies , the ones that can &apos;t be included , are surprising .
so there &apos;s a lot of really many days in our culture about <unk> .
and we have countries built in a very unusual concept of mass <unk> .
well , you can imagine how astonishing it is when your two children were born in a body .
and I recently met this situation , which was last year , Africa &apos;s track athletes , <unk> <unk> in the competition of <unk> <unk> <unk> in Berlin .
a lot of journalists called me up and asked me , &quot; What kind of test would it be like to prove to you whether <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
so I had to explain to them that there was no way to test .
in fact , we now know that gender is very complex , and we have to admit that there is no detailed line of difference between men or women or men or women or women or women or women , and that line is actually our own drawing .
so what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re talking about the more science is going to evolve , and we &apos;re going to admit that these patterns of gender @-@ specific patterns are very much more likely than we think of .
and it &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also about race , and it &apos;s also about the importance of our academic competence .
as we can see , we have all kinds of hard fields .
let &apos;s take an example , and the reality is that we use 95 percent of human DNA compared to gorilla .
the reality is that humans and gorilla are just slightly different from the bones of certain creatures .
the more technology has developed , the more difficult we have , the more difficult we have to admit , is simply too simplistic .
and because of that , we &apos;re looking at a lot of human life .
one of the fields , for example , is our cultural sphere , which is the beginning of life in the United States today .
we have a very difficult discussion about when we move from one body into a human being , and we have a different human right to the baby .
we have a very controversial issue today -- perhaps not as much as the internal public debate in medicine -- about the question of when to expect people to die .
in the old days , our ancestors never sat there much more kindly .
and most of all , it &apos;s like putting a feather under your nose , and if the feather moves , you can &apos;t keep them warm .
if the feather wasn &apos;t moving , they would be buried .
but what &apos;s happening today is that we want to transplant organs of the deceased into other people &apos;s bodies .
and as a result , we began to wonder about the problem that we had on the top of that , and that led us to a very difficult situation , which had never been possible before .
now you might think , all of these categories are falling apart , maybe happy people like me .
I &apos;m a progressive man in politics , and I do not maintain the people who are normal , but I have to admit that this is a disturbing effect .
realizing these systems are more unstable , and I felt nervous .
and at the same time , I came from a democratic perspective .
so to tell you about the level of intense tension , I have to admit that I &apos;m a big fan of all the women .
I know they &apos;re a <unk> , they &apos;re a <unk> , but they &apos;re great .
I mean , they &apos;re so heroic , fearless and engaged in their business , and I have to rethink my own <unk> every couple of years , to enjoy the first <unk> of the <unk> &quot; champion , &quot; not because music is completely ignored .
it &apos;s because what happened around the world in 1455 .
the creator , I think , is the earliest <unk> , which is why I love them .
they were against a anatomic concept , and they had another concept , which was a very good idea , 200 years away .
and when you think about our collective identities , it &apos;s the idea of a <unk> system , and the monarchy is based on a fairly simplistic idea .
the original institutions don &apos;t have DNA , but they &apos;re following the idea of &quot; born . &quot;
they have a <unk> concept .
they think that the people in politics are supposed to be in the trenches because the aristocracy was born to pass the father to the son .
the leaders against that view , and they use a new anatomical concept , which is called <unk> .
they took away the hierarchy of ideas , and they knew the anatomical importance of man equality , not the birth of it , and it was a very radical reform .
and in a way , this reform is still going , because they are part of the Enlightenment , and two things are common .
democracy is being formed at the time , but it &apos;s also technology .
and what &apos;s really striking is , if you look at the history of the foundation , many of them are interested in science , and they &apos;re all interested in the world .
they get rid of the opposition , and they get the view of the supernatural powers that are based on very rigid and ambiguous ideas .
they advocate the concept of <unk> .
if you look , for example , in the Declaration of Independence , they talk about natural and natural God .
they didn &apos;t mention the nature of God and God .
they talk about natural power to explain who we are .
so as a part of that , they bring us a concept that is human life , and that is the idea of equality .
and they did have a great road to the future .
they couldn &apos;t think about the future , but they built the foundations , which was great .
so what happened a few years later ?
for example , what happens to women , for example , what they want to do is they want to vote according to the ideas that are founded by people , and they say , &quot; We have <unk> and ovaries , which means that we don &apos;t have a free vote , we don &apos;t have a private citizen to go . &quot;
the women &apos;s opinion is good .
and this is the triumph of successful civil rights movement , someone like Joseph <unk> , who said , &quot; I &apos;m not a woman ? &quot;
we know that the man used to say &quot; I &apos;m a man . &quot;
in addition , the appeal to the crowds shouldn &apos;t be racism .
we see the same success cases where people are <unk> and <unk> .
the problem is , of course , when we start to look at all the citizens , we have to start to question why we can &apos;t keep a fixed line .
now , what I want to leave you with is that I want to maintain some limitations on our cultural scale .
for example , I don &apos;t want to give fish the same power as humans .
I don &apos;t want us to give up all the anatomical boundaries .
I don &apos;t want to say that a five @-@ year @-@ old kid can be allowed to have a sexual activity , or you can get married .
so there &apos;s some line of anatomical boundaries , which I think is meaningful for us , which is supposed to be kept .
but the challenge is to try and figure out why we should preserve them , what they mean .
so , let &apos;s go back to what I said earlier , which is that the two people that started out with the invention of the speech .
we have six and a half million people on the same day in 1979 .
let &apos;s imagine , Mary was born three months old , so she was born in the &apos; 50s .
Henry , the exact opposite , the foot was born in October of 1980 .
it was only three months before Mary was born , and the fact is that she had all kinds of rights over the course of the first three months before that , allowing the right to have sexual activity , the right to drink .
he had to wait for his physiology , no difference , but because he was born differently .
we also found some incredible rights problems .
Henry , by the time it was assumed to be a man -- although I haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s a <unk> genome -- because it &apos;s been hypothesized to be a man , Mary does not have to worry about it .
at the same time , Mary can &apos;t enjoy all states like Henry , the same is the right to marry .
Henry could get married in any state , but Mary could now marry a woman in a few states .
so some of the biological categories that we insisted on , they have problems in many ways , and they need to question .
for me , the problem is : what are we going to do when our science is so advanced , we are already here to admit that democracy on our anatomy may be broken .
I don &apos;t want to lose hope for science , but at the same time , it seems that science is affected by our effects .
so where do we go ?
it looks like our society has a fractal attitude : &quot; well , I have to draw a line somewhere , and I &apos;m going to draw a line . &quot;
but a lot of people get a very embarrassing place .
for example , Texas has a decision to marry a man that does not have Y chromosomes , and if you married a woman , you have Y chromosomes .
in reality , they don &apos;t actually test the chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very strange , because I started to tell you about the story of PMS .
for example , we looked at one of the modern democratic institutions , Martin Luther King , in his &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech , gave us a solution .
he thought that we should not judge a man &apos;s skin , but based on his <unk> , &quot; to judge a man &apos;s difference .
I was like , &quot; Yes , that sounds a good way . &quot;
but how do you practice it ?
how do you judge him based on his favor ?
I also want to point out that I &apos;m not sure that we should be conforming to human rights , because I have to admit that some golden apples are more likely to help other people than I know .
I also want to say that I know that some <unk> seems to be more effective than some 40 @-@ year @-@ old people at the age of marriage .
so how do we measure that problem ?
it turns out it &apos;s very difficult .
I also want to know that if the right thing can be scanned in the future -- maybe MRI ?
do we really want to get there ?
I &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
I know it &apos;s important to think about democracy in the United States .
we &apos;ve done a very good job for democracy , and I think it &apos;s going to be better .
we are different from Iran , like a man on sexual basis , for other men , so that he can be killed unless he wants to change his sexual orientation , and he can survive .
we don &apos;t have that .
I &apos;m very glad to say that we don &apos;t have that -- to a surgeon , that he said a couple of years ago , he brought a self @-@ interest to them , in some sense , to make them famous .
but when I asked him why he wanted to do this -- because it was a very high @-@ risk operation -- he said , in this country , this is going to be cruel , so he had to help them .
and I said to him , &quot; Well , are you thinking about <unk> instead of having surgery ? &quot;
the United States provides a lot of their own traits that they don &apos;t have to change their bodies in the country .
so I think we need to lead this idea .
well , at this point , I want to remind you that I &apos;ve talked about a lot of the things that I &apos;ve been talking about .
I also want to think about what democracy might look like , or what it &apos;s like if we can get more mothers to participate .
I also want to say that a bit of a radical idea of feminist is that I think that different people might be able to bring a different perspective , especially when we &apos;re used to thinking differently .
I &apos;ve been interested in poverty for years and years .
and one of the things that I &apos;m really interested in is looking at the difference between men and women in the world .
we know from a cultural study that we know about women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- more likely to look at complex social relationships and more caring about the vulnerable of people .
so if we think about it , we find a really interesting case .
a few years ago , when I was in graduate school , a woman who knew I was interested in -- I was a feminist , and I was always -- he asked me a weird question .
he said , &quot; Tell me where the feminist story is . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s the most important question I &apos;ve ever heard .
the feminist is the result of all the banal idea , and therefore , the feminist movement is not a girl .
but then , to interpret that , what I think about more is that maybe the feminist has some kind of a <unk> .
in other words , maybe there are a few women who think differently than men , and we are much more interested in complex social relationships and much more concerned about the vulnerable .
but people have pointed out how to protect the individual , how do we protect the nation without the mind , and if we inject it in that concept , it &apos;s possible that we &apos;re going to have more than just one idea of how to protect each other and how to take care of each other ?
maybe it &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to go in the future , and when we don &apos;t take away the human race -- that is to be less aware of the individual identity of the individual , but to think about the human relationship .
so , when people are trying to make a better military operation , what we need to think about is what we do for other people .
thank you .
I &apos;m Jesse , and this is my <unk> .
but when I showed you what I had in there , I was going to do a very openly statement , which is that I was so obsessed with clothing .
I &apos;ve been looking for them and wearing them , and recently , I &apos;ve been taking pictures of them and blog posts about them , every bag of different , varied , thick clothing , the best place it can be for a while .
but I don &apos;t buy anything new .
my clothes were bought from <unk> and <unk> .
Oh , thank you .
shopping allows me to reduce the impact of my clothing and the influence of my purse .
I could find interesting people ; I could save the money ; I &apos;d dress up ; I &apos;d be a <unk> ; and shopping was my private <unk> .
I think , what am I going to find today ?
is it my size ?
is it my favorite color ?
is that under 20 dollars ?
if the answer is yes , I feel like I win .
I want to go back to my <unk> and tell you about what I &apos;ve been doing for TED for a week .
what is this guy with so many clothes ?
so I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;ve got .
I brought the <unk> to this .
the first week that happened to me was everything that was in my life .
I bet I &apos;d found all my clothes that I needed .
and since you see me now , it &apos;s not the &quot; women in panties &quot; -- &quot; which meant that I actually found something new .
and I really want to show you a week of laundry .
does it sound good ?
and of course , I &apos;m going to talk to you about life guidance and so forth , whether you believe it or not , these are all the ideas that I &apos;m putting in my new position .
so we started .
I called this &quot; tiger . &quot;
you don &apos;t need to be generous in a lot of money .
it &apos;s almost like you can do it for almost 50 dollars , and it can be impressive .
this whole thing of clothing , the coat , was my <unk> , and this is the most expensive laundry I wear in my pocket .
Monday : color is powerful .
in biology , it &apos;s almost impossible to wear a bright red pants on it .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other happy people .
the mainstream is <unk> .
I &apos;ve spent a lot of my life trying to do myself and work in the mainstream .
you do it yourself .
if you have the right people around you , they don &apos;t just understand it , they enjoy it .
Wednesday : embrace your <unk> .
sometimes people tell me , I &apos;m dressed , or I asked them to think about their seven @-@ year @-@ old .
I like to smile and say , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
self @-@ confidence is key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good , you &apos;re going to be dressed up pretty good .
if you don &apos;t think you &apos;re looking good , you &apos;re pretty good .
my mother told me this every day .
but I was 30 years old enough to know what that means .
and I &apos;ll just give you a quick analysis .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person , <unk> , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there is no reason for everybody here .
we can wear what to wear .
thank you .
Friday : a pervasive truth -- a few words : gold <unk> .
and finally , a Saturday . it &apos;s a wonderful way to tell the world who you are , not to say .
it &apos;s time for me to prove that when people go to me this week , it &apos;s just because I &apos;m wearing it . we &apos;re having a great conversation .
and of course , the clothes didn &apos;t break into my little <unk> .
so before I go back to Brooklyn , I &apos;m going to do everything .
because this week I was teaching myself to let go .
I don &apos;t need to be <unk> , because in the next corner , there will always be a crazy set of <unk> that will fit in and waiting for me just to look for love .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon .
I have something I want to show you .
think of this as a pixel , a flight lens .
we call it <unk> .
let me introduce you to this .
now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian , I have this picture of every Italian boy on the wall , and they grow up , but I &apos;ll show you this because something interesting happened in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was in the last decades .
it used to be that if you wanted to have a budget at the racetrack , you just have a budget , and you &apos;re betting on a good <unk> and a car .
if your car is good enough , you &apos;re going to get it right .
now , if you want to take a look , in fact , you need other things like this -- some that can actually test the vehicle for a car , that can connect thousands of sensors that will be collected in the car , transmit data into the system , and process that and use that to actually signal processing the car in real time so that it can actually transform the car in real time .
and that &apos;s what engineers say , what they call real @-@ time surveillance .
basically , the system includes two components , one of which is a drives .
now , what &apos;s interesting is that this real @-@ time surveillance system is beginning to percolate down into our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , have been covered by Internet , electronic industrial .
it &apos;s like a Wi @-@ Fi computer .
at the same time , as a Wi @-@ Fi computer , they begin to make a difference between sensing and <unk> .
if we can optimize the city , it &apos;s actually a leap .
and I would like to say that cities are two percent of the Earth &apos;s Earth &apos;s surface , but they &apos;ve contributed to 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
their energy consumption is 75 percent of the world -- produces 80 percent of CO2 emissions .
so if we optimize the city , it &apos;s going to be a flying .
and on top of these cities , all these sensing and flow are being in our daily lives .
this is an exhibit of <unk> <unk> Museum in New York City .
the theme is &quot; talking to me . &quot;
our environment , our environment , is beginning to give us feedback .
in a sense , just like every atom is turning into sensors and <unk> .
and it fundamentally changed the relationship between us and nature .
in a sense , this is the old dream .
you know , when Moses was like Moses , like Moses , at the end of the day , he threw the Moses , like -- in fact , you see the little <unk> at the bottom -- says , &quot; <unk> , why are you talking about <unk> ? &quot;
today , for the first time , our environment started giving us feedback .
I &apos;m going to show you a few cases -- one time , when our consciousness gets to feel and respond to our environment .
let &apos;s start with sensing .
I want to share with you the first project that actually was one of our first projects in our lab .
it was in Italy six months before four years ago .
what we &apos;re doing there is actually a new network of networks that were already spread around the world -- cellphones , Internet networks -- and collecting any terminal information that would otherwise be collected by this Internet to understand how the city works .
this summer was a very lucky summer -- 2006 .
this is the year the Italian World Cup <unk> .
some of you may remember , that was the French competition , the one before the <unk> , the one that got it .
anyways , Italy won .
now look at what happened on that day and show what happened in real time .
you &apos;re looking at cities .
you see the big <unk> of Rome , the <unk> .
this is the morning , before the competition .
you &apos;re looking at the top of the timeline .
and at lunch , the guy over here is walking .
the game started -- silence .
<unk> <unk> . Italy was a <unk> .
<unk> , everybody quickly <unk> the phone , went to a toilet .
the game is over .
the first one , the second one .
<unk> , <unk> .
Italian won . ha .
that night , everybody went to the center and celebrated .
you can see rush hour .
the next day , everybody went to the center of the city , the <unk> and the prime .
then the second one started to turn back .
you see this place called <unk> , where people are going to celebrate -- there will be a great party at the end of the day .
it &apos;s just one example of how we feel about this city today , and how we can &apos;t do that in a couple of years ago .
another quick example of perception : this is not about people , but about the things that we use and consume .
today , we know where everything comes from .
this is a map that shows you all the <unk> of a Mac , how you compose .
but we have very little sense of where the last generation is over .
so this project , we actually invented some small tags to track the waste so that it &apos;s moving through the system .
in fact , we worked with a bunch of volunteers in Seattle who were willing to help us , just a year ago , to give people the things that people were throwing away -- different kinds of things that you saw -- things that we didn &apos;t have to throw away .
we take the little <unk> , the little tags , the ones that surround it and start tracking it .
this is what we see .
from Seattle ...
a week later .
and from that information , we learned that there are so many inefficient operating systems .
I actually do the same thing with less energy .
the data was not used before .
but there &apos;s a lot of garbage and complex things happening .
there &apos;s another thing that we believe that if we think about the cup that we &apos;re throwing away every day , it doesn &apos;t go away , it &apos;s still somewhere around the Earth .
we &apos;re still going to throw a glass bottle every day .
if we show this to people , then we can also advocate for changing behaviors .
so that &apos;s what this project is about .
I &apos;m at MIT , and the Athabasca , who will tell you more about perception and a lot of the wonderful things that we can do , but I want to start with the second part , which is actually about our environment .
the first project was done a couple of years ago in Spain .
it started with a problem that the mayor suggested , and he found that Spain was so big that it was in South Europe , and it was traditional with water in public land .
the problem is : technology , new technology , how do you get the whipped cream ?
and one of the ideas that came from MIT is about , imagine a tube that you have , you have a valve , you have a kidney , you have a kidney , you have a kidney , you have a kidney , you have a kidney system , you have a kidney , you have a kidney , you have a kidney , you have a kidney , you have a kidney , you , you have a kidney , you , you have a kidney cancer , you turn it , you turn it , you turn
you create a map of water as the pixel .
and if the pixels are dropping , you can do it on it , you can show the <unk> , the image .
when you get close to it , it even starts to shut you up , as you can see here .
we showed this to the mayor of Narok .
he liked it .
and then we got the permission to build a building .
we called it the digital <unk> .
the whole building is made of water .
without the door or the window , but when you walk into it , it automatically opens up the road .
the roof is also covered with water .
if you have a little bit of wind , if you want less water , you can actually cut the roofs down .
or even close the building , the building disappears , and it looks like this .
and these days , you &apos;ll see them in the winter , and when they get to the roof , they say , &quot; They &apos;re dropping out of the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t have it , but when it dropped , the building was nearly gone .
this is what water does .
you can see how people get into trouble .
this is a sensor that I &apos;m trying to keep my hands on , turning the lights on .
I should tell you something happened at night when all of the sensors stopped working .
but that evening became even more interesting .
all the kids in the People are going to go to the building , because it &apos;s slightly different .
the tower doesn &apos;t automatically open you up , but the building is divided into a different space , so you can &apos;t get to go and get out of it .
and it &apos;s also interesting for us , because , as an architect , a designer , we think about how people use things that we &apos;ve designed .
but the reality is surprising .
it &apos;s also about doing these things . it &apos;s about using and interacting .
this is a physical camera , which is made of water , and then made a projection .
and it reminds me of the next project I want to show you .
this is , imagine these pixels running .
imagine you have a small helicopter that can move around in the air , and each one has a little screen that can change the camera -- almost a cloud that can move around in the sky .
watch a video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one we just saw , and a few other helicopters , synchronize , moving .
so you get this cloud .
you get a flexible screen , or you show it like this -- a two @-@ dimensional setting .
or ordinary , but three @-@ dimensional , this is where the drama is , not the pixels .
you can use different approaches .
imagine that your monitor can be used in different sizes or scales with different <unk> .
but all of this is just a third @-@ dimensional cloud that you can pull and cross through and see from a lot of perspective .
this is the trajectory of a standard grid that I just showed you .
when you turn on the lights , you can actually see this . it &apos;s the same thing that we saw .
imagine if every one of those is controlled by the human being .
you can make every pixel have input from the people , moving it from people , and so on .
I &apos;ll show you some of the first ones .
we &apos;re working with <unk> <unk> <unk> , one of the leading parts of New York City , the New York Museum of Modern Art -- to capture his 3D movements in real time .
you can see the <unk> are dancing .
you can see on the left , the difference .
it &apos;s all 3D scanning and capturing in real time .
so you can reproduce the whole thing .
you can jump like this .
but once you have these pixels , you can control them with color and gravity and spin .
we want to use this as a kind of false input that can fly .
I want to show you the last project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s what we did for the Olympics in London .
it &apos;s called the digital cloud .
and the idea is that again , once again , we can get people to do something about changing the environment -- which is to fund our digital clouds -- like the <unk> building , but the digital cloud .
think about giving everyone a pixel .
and I think what &apos;s happened over the last few years is that , in the last few decades , we &apos;ve gone through physical worlds to digital worlds .
now , the power of electronics , knowledge , is everywhere in the Internet .
today , the first -- Obama campaign told us -- we can go from digital self @-@ organized networks to physical worlds .
it &apos;s possible , and in this case , we want to design and make a sign .
it &apos;s going to mean some building in the city .
but in the future , it can be the challenge of today -- think about climate change or carbon dioxide -- how we go from digital to the physical world .
so we can actually get people involved in this .
this is the cloud , and , using the lens , the way the cloud formed , it &apos;s the cloud formation of clouds forming the clouds .
these tin particles are water , and the digital <unk> cloud .
this is in London .
you can walk in and feel different experiences .
you can actually see it at the bottom of the 2012 Olympic trials and really use it as a bridge to connect society .
and also the clouds in the sky and some of the peaks that you can get , like the new top of London .
you can get into that .
it &apos;s a completely new digital <unk> at night -- but most importantly , creating a kind of experience that any one of you can get there .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my artwork , I try to demonstrate that humans are not separate from nature , but everything is interconnected .
about 10 years ago , I went to Antarctica , and I first saw the iceberg .
I feel awe .
my heart is quick , <unk> , trying to understand what this is in front of me .
the tip of my iceberg was almost 200 feet away , and I was just amazed by a snowflake , and it was formed next year , year after year .
the tip of the iceberg is when they broke off the glacier , or broke off the ice shelf .
each tip has its own unique personality .
they have a vivid way of interacting with the environment .
some of the iceberg refused to stick , and some other iceberg could not stand up until a very passionate <unk> .
when you look at the iceberg , it &apos;s easy to think that they &apos;re all alone , they &apos;re alone , they &apos;re alone , they &apos;re alone , they &apos;re more like our human perception .
but the reality is much more than that .
as the tip of the iceberg , I breathe into its ancient odor .
as the tip of the iceberg , it released the minerals of the <unk> that feeds everything .
I began to shoot these iceberg as I was filming my portraits , understanding that at these individual islands of <unk> could exist in such a way that no longer exists .
when they melt , it was never a death , it was an end , it was a journey to the end of a new generation .
I photographed the iceberg , which was very young -- thousands of years .
some ice is over 100,000 years .
the last image I want to show you is a iceberg in Greenland .
it &apos;s a very rare opportunity to actually see a iceberg .
so that &apos;s right here .
on the left you see a boat .
it &apos;s about 15 feet of a ship .
I want you to notice the shape of the iceberg that &apos;s on the surface .
and here you see it starts with a small boat , moving over the other side , where a man stands there .
this is an average size of Greenland .
it &apos;s about 120 feet or 40 meters tall .
this is actual shot .
like this iceberg , they show you a different aspect of their personality .
thank you .
I &apos;ve had the opportunity to participate in a lot of amazing projects in life .
but the really cool project that was done was related to this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the original graffiti artist in the 1980s .
he goes home one day and says , &quot; Dad , my legs are kind of exhilarating . &quot;
this is the early onset of the pathology .
he &apos;s completely paralyzed .
only his eyes can move .
I &apos;d been exposed to him .
I work on design and animation , obviously the graffiti is a complex component that we admire in the artistic world .
so we decided to be Tony , the sponsor , the sponsor .
so I went to find his brother and his father and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you some money .
what would you do ? &quot;
he said , &quot; I just want to talk to Tony .
I just want to communicate with him and he can communicate with me . &quot;
I said , &quot; Wait a second , I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking , &quot; not all the paralysis people can communicate through these devices ?
he said , &quot; No , no , unless it &apos;s a terrible man , &quot; with an awful lot of money , or not .
these instruments are not so easy . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , how do you communicate ? &quot;
have you ever seen the movie &quot; <unk> and butterflies ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- moving their fingers .
I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s too late . how would that be ? &quot;
the wish that I &apos;d come up was to open the check , and instead , I &apos;d just come up with a check that I &apos;d never knew how to keep going .
and I promised his brother and his father -- &quot; Well , let &apos;s speak , let &apos;s give him a machine that we &apos;ll find a way to make him work again .
because a person is still sane and can &apos;t communicate , it &apos;s just ridiculous . &quot;
a few months later , I had a talk at a conference .
I met these guys called <unk> , graffiti lab , where they have a technology that allows them to take a beam of light into any surface and then painting it with a laser , which would form a dark gap .
they walk around and show art like this .
all of these things , they call a life @-@ cycle .
start with the <unk> , then the <unk> , then the <unk> , and then the man sees art .
but they &apos;re always showing a life @-@ cycle .
I went home and I dinner with my wife for dinner at a time , and I told her , &quot; So wait , if we know this technology can help you control things with your eyes , why don &apos;t we let a fly to control a laser , this is what he can do again . &quot;
so we started acting .
about two years later , a year later , through many organizations and many of us changed something .
first of all , we had the insurance gate , and we really gave him a machine to communicate -- an Stephen Hawking &apos;s machine .
that was fantastic .
he was really the most fun -- I called him <unk> because you were talking to him , and he was like , &quot; I &apos;m not going to do this . &quot;
the other thing that we did was , we got programmers from all over the world -- literally , every corner of the world -- bringing them to us .
my wife and I had moved to the back garage , the hackers , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , took over our house .
a lot of our friends think that we &apos;re doing this kind of stupid things that we put back on the wall when we put it back on the wall , the picture is taken , and the walls are painted .
but after two weeks , we did two weeks , we went to Venice , and my kids were involved , and my dog was involved , and we made this .
we call it eye contact , and you can look at that .
this is the cheap <unk> that we bought in Venice , some <unk> and some lessons from <unk> and <unk> .
we take a <unk> camera , we dismantle it , we put it in a LED , and now this device is free -- we make it open source , you can download it for free .
now we can do all of this without limitations .
no insurance would say , &quot; No . &quot;
no hospital can say , &quot; No . &quot;
anyone who &apos;s paralyzed can now use their eyes to draw and communicate .
thank you .
thank you very much . it &apos;s wonderful .
at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
I love this picture because this is somebody &apos;s room , and this is his room .
all this congestion pricing is for this momentous occasion .
in more than a year &apos;s plan , two weeks of programming , fast @-@ tracking meetings , Tony &apos;s first paintings in seven years .
this is an amazing image , because it &apos;s his life support system , and he &apos;s looking at his life support system .
we had his bed ; we had him see .
we formed a projector , and we put it on the wall outside his hospital .
he starts painting again , in front of his family and friends -- you can imagine what it &apos;s like in parking lots .
and what &apos;s interesting is that we &apos;re also going to break the parking lot so that we feel like we &apos;re a part of the whole thing .
at the end of this , he had written us a <unk> , and it said , &quot; This is the first painting I could ever paint .
I thought I &apos;d been underwater , and I finally got a handle to the surface and get me to breathe . &quot;
it &apos;s wonderful , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s kind of like our fight .
and that &apos;s what keeps us moving .
we &apos;ve gone so far to do that .
it &apos;s a wonderful device , but it &apos;s not like the painting .
a artistic potential has more money .
we &apos;re still trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , more powerful .
since then , we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a lot of rewards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; nobody in us is making money .
all the costs are us .
we &apos;re like , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s amazing . &quot;
Armstrong had written about our Twitter , and then in December , the Science Times gave us one of the lucky ones in 2010 , which is really cool .
and the coolest thing is -- this is going to complete the entire cycle -- the new Museum of <unk> in the city of Los Angeles , is going to have a place called &quot; street art . &quot;
and &quot; street art &quot; will have a lot of the bad guys -- the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> -- all of these people will be coming .
it &apos;s going to be in the middle of the night , which is great .
so basically my view is that if you look at something that is impossible , make it possible .
everything that happens in this room is impossible -- the stage , this computer , this eye , this eye -- it &apos;s never possible .
it &apos;s everybody in this room that makes it possible .
I &apos;m not a programmer , I &apos;ve never done anything to do with the eye , but I &apos;m just thinking about something and connecting me and some amazing people , and we can do something about it .
I &apos;m trying to get everybody in the day , and when you think about something that you should do , you should ask your questions . if I don &apos;t do it now , when do I don &apos;t do it , who would do that ?
thank you .
as you know , my job is to write a children &apos;s book , and in fact , I &apos;m probably the most popular kid in America .
I often tell people that I don &apos;t want to be a scientist .
you can think of me as a farmer , or a wearing of <unk> , but nobody &apos;s ever been a farmer .
I &apos;m here to tell you about recycling and epiphany .
and it &apos;s often a surprise that you get stuck in certain circumstances .
you have to reach out and find an epiphany around you .
this is a picture of a cycle .
a friend of mine drew -- Richard <unk> .
it &apos;s complicated . I &apos;m going to tell you about that .
my cycle started in the 1960s with a <unk> high school , when I was a kid .
I was the one who had been recorded every week until a teacher put me out of this life .
she pulled me out of this life , and she put me in the bathroom in the teacher &apos;s room .
she was doing it .
she did it for three years .
but I had to leave this town .
with respect , 85 dollars , finally , I was a <unk> , California -- I encountered my love -- the &apos; 80s , and I discovered that working in HIV / AIDS was necessary .
about three or four years ago , I got a Ph.D. from that teacher , <unk> teacher , and she said , &quot; I need to see you .
I was so disappointed that we never knew each other with adults .
can you come up and bring that guy up , please ?
I should mention that I have <unk> cancer , but I think you can ignore that part .
so , the next day we went to Cleveland .
we met her , we spoke , we cry , we knew that she needed to take the terminal health of the patient .
we found one for her , took her back and took care of her family because it was necessary .
some things we need to know how to do .
it was this way of looking at me as an adult , trying to understand my girls , and eventually the powder was placed in my hands .
and what happened was that , at the end of the cycle , it formed a circle -- the epiphany of which I called it , the epiphany .
and that epiphany was a part of life .
she saved my life , and my friend saved her life .
and that was the day of life .
it &apos;s got to be realistic and happy , and I &apos;m glad that many times today has been mentioned .
it also needed -- it needed respect and joy , and the work that we were working on was to take these walks .
thank you .
the idea behind the computer worms is actually quite simple .
we don &apos;t want Iran to have a nuclear weapon .
they &apos;re used to building nuclear weapons @-@ based facilities , which are highly centralized <unk> facilities .
the <unk> box you see here is real @-@ time control .
if we manage to hack into these speed and valves &apos; systems , we can actually solve a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
this <unk> box can &apos;t run Windows ; they &apos;re using very different techniques .
but if we manage to put a Windows virus on a laptop that was used for this <unk> box , then we could start to move .
this is a conspiracy behind the <unk> virus .
so I started with a Windows <unk> .
it carried the virus up to the <unk> box , and a shower project -- the task was done .
it &apos;s easy , right ?
I want to tell you how we found this .
when we started working on <unk> viruses about six months ago , we knew nothing about it .
the only thing that you know is that its Windows parts , which is very complicated , have multiple <unk> attacks .
it doesn &apos;t seem to have anything to do with these physical systems .
and this led to our attention , and we started a lab to develop a virus that we had , and we ran a very careful examination .
and something very interesting happened .
the <unk> virus works like a <unk> <unk> -- smelling <unk> , but not to eat .
I don &apos;t understand .
and after we experimented with various <unk> , I realized that this is a targeted attack .
it &apos;s totally targeted .
if you find a specific configuration , it will actually reach into the <unk> box , even if it &apos;s trying to get infected , it &apos;s doing the same thing .
if they don &apos;t find the target , they don &apos;t do anything .
and this really struck me , because I don &apos;t think we know it yet .
the goal is , for example , a US power plant , or a German chemical factory .
so we better figure out what &apos;s going on .
we extracted and <unk> the code , and we found that it had two digital bombs -- a smaller , smaller , bigger .
and we &apos;ve also found that they &apos;re understood by the people who are very professional .
they know everything about the attack .
they even know the number of shoes that the operator has .
they know everything .
if you &apos;ve heard about it , the complexity of the virus , the complexity of the virus , let me tell you : it &apos;s very complicated .
it &apos;s not something that we &apos;ve seen .
and here you can see the footage of the actual attack .
we &apos;re talking about -- it &apos;s about 50,000 <unk> code .
it looks like old <unk> .
I want to tell you how we can get the code .
the first thing we &apos;re looking for is the system <unk> , because we know what these functions are .
and then we have to find the <unk> and the <unk> , and then try to connect them to the physical world -- to the potential world .
so we need a theory that we can use to prove whether or not .
in order to get a theory , we remember it would have been a serious disruption , and therefore there &apos;s a high @-@ value target , and it &apos;s possible that &apos;s in Iran , because there &apos;s so much virus reported in Iran .
it doesn &apos;t make a lot of targets in this area .
you can basically narrow the target down to <unk> and <unk> plants .
so I said to my assistant , &quot; Give me a list of all the marketing and nuclear power plants . &quot;
I had a telephone with them , and I had them use their expertise to study what we found in code and data .
it works very well .
we can connect this little number with the <unk> .
the <unk> is the inside of the magazine , the black object you see .
if you control the treadmill at the speed of the month , you can actually decipher the pen and make it explode .
we &apos;re also seeing the preparation of the attack is to slow the pace of the muscles -- obviously , to keep them mad , they &apos;re not going to be able to find the problem very quickly .
big numbers are not -- by carefully observing data and <unk> , we have the opportunity to understand it .
for example , the number one is very striking in these code ; it &apos;s not possible to ignore it .
I began to study how these <unk> could be built in a science literature about how they were organized in a thing called a level , and each level has a shelf .
it &apos;s kind of obvious , it &apos;s fine .
even better match .
in Iran , all of these scanning teams are divided into 15 of the so @-@ called .
guess what we found in the code ?
a virtually identical co @-@ evolutionary structure .
so , it &apos;s perfectly match once again .
this gave us more confidence in what we &apos;re doing .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , it doesn &apos;t work like this .
these results include a couple of weeks of hard work .
we go all the way down the street and go back to the beginning .
anyway , we &apos;ve figured out these two pairs that aim for the same number .
the small choose a floor , the vertical axis , the velocity , the accelerometer , and then they slow it down , and then the big one would choose six floor and control the valve .
in general , we were very confident that we knew what the target was .
it &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
we &apos;re not worried about the possibility of other viruses being attacked by <unk> .
some of the really cool things that we saw -- actually , I was really surprised .
there &apos;s the <unk> box there , and there &apos;s a backpack on it .
and the thing is that it stops the input from the sensor -- for example , the input from pressure sensors and shock sensors -- and providing a legal code for attack , which is still in the attack , which is still in the case of the attack , and the actual inputs to the data .
in fact , the actual number of input @-@ output data is <unk> virus .
like the <unk> footage of the film in Hollywood , the camera was even recorded at a pre @-@ recorded video .
cool , right ?
it was intended to be not just the driver of the control room .
it &apos;s actually more dangerous , it &apos;s more aggressive .
it &apos;s going to be around the digital security system .
we need the digital safety system where the human operator can &apos;t do fast .
for example , in the power power power plant , when the power comes down , you have to open the power in a millisecond .
obviously , the human operator can &apos;t do that .
so here we need the digital security system .
and when they get hurt , the real problem comes up .
the plants explode .
the operator and the safety system doesn &apos;t notice .
it &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
what I &apos;m going to say is very important .
think about this . the attack is universal .
it doesn &apos;t have to do specific things about a centrifuge .
it will work as well , for example , in a power plant or a car .
it &apos;s very ordinary .
as an attacker , you don &apos;t need -- you don &apos;t have to transmit a USB key , you see that in the case of the <unk> virus .
you can also use conventional worms to transmit .
it &apos;s as widespread as possible .
and if you do that , it will eventually have a mass @-@ produce weapon .
that &apos;s what we have to confront .
unfortunately , the biggest goal of these attacks is not in the Middle East .
it &apos;s in the U.S. , Europe and Japan .
all these green areas , these are target density .
we have to confront these consequences , and we want to be prepared immediately .
thank you .
I have a problem .
Ralph , <unk> , people thought that was a <unk> .
how do you look ?
Ralph <unk> : okay , you really want to know ?
yeah , OK .
I think it &apos;s not Israel . it &apos;s not Israel .
the original military at the back was the Internet .
only one , that &apos;s America -- luckily , fortunately .
because otherwise , the problem is even worse .
thank you very much , and thank you , Ralph .
in the last few years , I &apos;ve made myself vulnerable and dangerous .
I went to prison -- tough .
I worked in a coal mines -- dangerous .
I photographed the film in the war -- both hard and dangerous .
I &apos;d been eating this food for about 30 days -- which was very interesting at the beginning , and at the end , it was a little hard and dangerous .
in fact , I &apos;ve spent most of my career setting myself up in the wrong condition by making people more interested , in the more interesting way to study social problems , wanting to bring these questions in front of an audience .
so , when I knew I was going to come here and do a TEDTalk about brands and funding , I realized that I wanted to be a <unk> .
you may have heard about it a couple of weeks ago , and I ran an ad in <unk> .
and on Facebook and Twitter , I gave people a chance to buy my TED Talk in 2011 .
yes , some lucky individuals or corporations are going to get the only opportunity in life -- because I &apos;m sure Chris Anderson won &apos;t allow this to happen the second time -- the second time you &apos;re looking at the TED Talk , which is not quite a surprising title , which is not relevant .
so what you get is : your reputation is over here : you don &apos;t know anything about my TED Talk , and the content determines whether I &apos;m going to mess it up , and if I give you shame , if I give you shame , and that &apos;s the probability is too big .
but anyway , this is an amazing opportunity for advertising .
do you know how many people are watching TED ?
that &apos;s too much .
by the way , this is the headline of the speech .
and even though I did that , I still believe that someone would have bought a <unk> .
if you were to ask me a year ago , I wouldn &apos;t look like this .
but , in my new project that I &apos;m working on , which is the reality of my new film , we have to do something about marketing , the reality of the world .
as I said earlier in the years , I &apos;ve always let myself enter the midst of terrible conditions , but I &apos;ve been most vulnerable to my practice , and I &apos;ve been in danger , and I &apos;ve been most vulnerable to these people .
you see , I have this idea .
Morgan <unk> : I wanted to make a film like this , make deals with marketing , marketing , video revenues from ads , marketing , marketing .
the title of the film &quot; The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; the greatest <unk> of all time on the planet &quot; and &quot; bottom , &quot; is filled with brands from top to bottom -- the top one is the brand . X .
the brand , the <unk> <unk> Center .
these people are living with the movie &quot; <unk> &quot; -- it &apos;s never going to happen .
and this is a view of the film -- Michael Heizer : what &apos;s going on here ? Michael <unk> : what &apos;s this ?
I &apos;m always talking .
that is to emphasize .
it &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to get an x @-@ ray of the brand , but we &apos;re also going to sell every product in the film .
so , we sell a pair of shoes , and we &apos;re the oldest shoe ever devised .
&quot; the greatest <unk> of all time in the history of film &quot; was the best drives ever to drive a car in history , to make the film &quot; Museum of <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> : so that means not only is it a part of the branding actually funding the film ?
<unk> <unk> : in fact , we can show the process of marketing .
the film is about transparency .
in the movie , you &apos;re going to see a process of marketing .
this is the idea of the whole movie , and it goes through the movie .
I wish I could help .
Robert Friedman : it was fun to hear about it at the beginning , and I think it was the most noble respect for the audience .
but I don &apos;t know if people can .
Anil Gupta : have you ever predicted -- I don &apos;t want to take that word because it has a negative color -- what happens to the film ?
David <unk> : how much money does this film take ?
a million and a half million .
JH : I think it &apos;s very hard to work with these brand , but I think it &apos;s very hard to find these big brands .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : who knows , when your movie came out , we might be a bunch of stupid <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : what do you think they &apos;re going to do ?
cartoon <unk> : most of them will refuse .
<unk> <unk> : and the reason they don &apos;t say it is because I am ?
JH : all right .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> .
sir , can you help me ? I need help .
Michael <unk> : I can help you .
Michael Pritchard : okay .
it &apos;s wonderful .
Michael Sandel : we must be locked in the brand .
Michael Pritchard : yeah .
those of you who are going to work with ...
Michael <unk> : we have some people working on it .
the camera shut the camera off .
<unk> <unk> : I thought , &quot; I &apos;m going to turn the camera off , &quot; which is private .
as a result , it said , &quot; We don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your film . &quot;
<unk> <unk> : so here &apos;s the company , one after the other .
no one was willing to help this film .
I was amazed .
they &apos;re not interested in this project .
and I was really surprised that I thought that the idea of advertising and what was essentially to put your product up in front of as many people as possible to see your product .
particularly nowadays , the medium of modern world media shouldn &apos;t be used in such a new way of transmitting information to people ?
no , it &apos;s just my own idea .
the problem is , you see my thoughts have a fatal mistake here .
in fact , no , this is wrong .
that &apos;s not the problem .
this is acceptable .
but this graph represents the problem .
you see , if you search for &quot; <unk> &quot; in Google , this is -- this is one of the top shots .
I like your mode , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the problem : transparency , transparency -- transparency , transparency , transparency , understanding and access to information , and access to business -- the last possible question is probably the biggest problem .
you see , we hear about transparency recently .
our politicians , our president , even our CEO , are using this word .
however , at the end of the day , things happened .
why ? transparency is <unk> -- like this is just frozen , but it &apos;s also a shout .
it &apos;s fascinating -- it &apos;s like this weird street in the countryside .
it looks like a <unk> .
so what else is wrong ?
you eat a whole <unk> ice cream cone .
it &apos;s pretty amazing .
when I started talking to companies , we wanted to tell a story like this , and they said , &quot; Oh , we want to tell you a story .
we want you to tell stories , we want you to tell our stories . &quot;
when I was a kid , my father sometimes would find me staring at me in the face of his eyes all the time -- he would say , &quot; sons , every story has three faces .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , and there &apos;s a real story . &quot;
you see , we want to tell the story through the film .
and only one of the companies were willing to help me -- because I worked with John Allen and Richard <unk> &apos;s <unk> for years -- I realized , well , I had to skip the route , and I had to get my team out of direct work with the businesses .
and you suddenly start to realize -- or when I started to realize -- you start talking to these companies about your own brand as a universal problem .
<unk> <unk> : I have two friends of mine filming the Great film of Hollywood , and I know that friends like I make small independent movies .
and my friends of Hollywood movies told me they were successful because of their brand .
and my friends who made small , independent movie , said , &quot; How can we make these Hollywood movies ? &quot;
and this is a movie called &quot; The <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so how can we look at this brand in the video ?
every time I go out , every time I open my cabinet , you will see the <unk> body fluids .
whenever I talk to someone , I say , &quot; Well , you &apos;re clean enough ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
let me help you relax .
maybe you can use it before you talk about it . &quot;
we &apos;re going to roll these <unk> body fluids .
whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , there &apos;s always one for you .
we &apos;re going to try to get men out of these products -- solid , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> body fluids .
that &apos;s roughly what happens .
now I &apos;m going to answer any of your questions , and let you know what happened .
Frank <unk> : we are a very well @-@ known brand .
it &apos;s like the little movies that you &apos;re talking about , and we &apos;re a very early brand .
we don &apos;t look like other big brands .
and doing that -- you know , it &apos;s about reaching people &apos;s attention -- it &apos;s about reaching us .
<unk> <unk> : what would you like to describe a brand ?
how about five minutes ?
Frank <unk> : okay .
technology .
<unk> <unk> : technology is not the best way to describe body fluids , it &apos;s made of people &apos;s <unk> @-@ like products .
we talked about daring , <unk> , <unk> .
I want to say , &quot; <unk> &quot; is a positive flow of products , a flow of <unk> , of comfort .
it gives you a sense of <unk> .
how do you keep your body fresh breath -- three times more <unk> .
these are positive effects .
that &apos;s a $ <unk> million business .
what about me ? what about a man ?
I have to ask people about the streets , and they are like me , and they are the <unk> .
they have to tell their brand .
<unk> <unk> : how do you describe your brand ?
my brand ?
I don &apos;t know .
I love very well .
the 1980s held the <unk> , unless today is the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : okay , so what is a brand ?
Michael Sandel .
I think that &apos;s my particular style is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I love the dark matter .
I usually wear a <unk> like <unk> , and I like a crystal <unk> .
if you have a brand , he might be a classic <unk> private <unk> , like the Mercedes <unk> .
my brand name is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
two : a bit of a hippie , sort of suspended animation for a girl in Brooklyn -- I don &apos;t know .
I like to raise my pet .
my national national bank , even the world .
I think that &apos;s my brand .
in this distorted little industry , this is my brand .
my brand is FedEx . I &apos;m packing .
&quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
is this a real problem ?
lawyer : my brand is lawyers .
Tom : I &apos;m Tom .
<unk> <unk> : so we can &apos;t all be Tom , but I find myself the result of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; as well .
I realized that what I needed was an expert .
one of the people who was able to read what was inside me was thinking , what could actually help me understand what the brand is .
so I found a company in Pittsburgh called <unk> .
they &apos;ve helped the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the branding , the identity of their brand .
if they can help those brands , they will help me .
EO : you &apos;ve got the picture right ?
<unk> <unk> : I took . the first picture is my <unk> jacket .
<unk> <unk> : please tell me how this picture feels about you .
<unk> <unk> : these people helped me make a view of the world .
<unk> <unk> : what kind of world is this ?
<unk> : the world ? I think your world is the world that you live in -- all of you , your friends , your family , your lifestyle , your work .
it all has a place to get married , and that &apos;s where I &apos;m in West Virginia .
<unk> : what about next picture ?
<unk> <unk> : next . this is my favorite day .
<unk> : what does this relate to you ?
<unk> : this is about who I want to be .
I love weird things .
I love weird things .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; why &quot; -- what does this help us ?
so what does that mean ? where do you come from ?
why is it so important ? what is the red ?
let me explain this part .
what doesn &apos;t match your style ?
what kind of <unk> did you get ?
it &apos;s not always fear . what kind of a roller coaster that you &apos;re sitting on ?
<unk> <unk> : yeah .
<unk> <unk> : thank your patient for working .
EO : yeah .
well , I don &apos;t know what the end result is .
that &apos;s a lot of complicated stuff .
Erin <unk> : the idea of the first person in your brand has two different layers , and the two reinforce each other -- zero @-@ sum brand is a single , consistent brand .
these two very well combine together .
it &apos;s almost like a <unk> .
I think some of the companies are always one of the advantages , and not both .
most companies prefer -- which is <unk> -- don &apos;t prevent them from avoiding fear , etc . , but you &apos;re actually going to turn this into a <unk> , which is good .
so what about a brand like that ?
the first is the classic , Apple .
there &apos;s also the <unk> , the dome , with the <unk> in it .
some brands are &quot; <unk> , &quot; and some brands are deep , and these brands aren &apos;t long enough , but a depth of ideas , and a huge brand of power .
<unk> <unk> : a brand . what about your brand ?
what if somebody asked you to describe your brand , your brand identity , how would you describe it ?
are you happy ? are you happy ?
or is it a sinister brand ?
are your brand more dense , <unk> ?
the brand is more expensive , like the novelty <unk> , adventure like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
or are you more vulnerable ?
do you think of it as James Bond ?
are you a <unk> , a traditional , <unk> like Oprah ?
do you deserve to be generous , to be aware , to be safe , to be compassionate , like the Dalai Lama or the <unk> ?
and from this film , we found over 1,000 or more low @-@ tech businesses , who said , &quot; No , they don &apos;t want to have anything to do with the film .
they don &apos;t want to have anything to do with the film because they don &apos;t have control , they don &apos;t have control .
but we eventually got 17 cooperative companies who were willing to give control over how they could collaborate with people like me , who had their power to tell stories , to tell stories about the unseen stories that we don &apos;t know -- the advertisers that go out into it .
they tell us a story about the neural network , how they do it in the movie , and how they use MRI to find the areas in your brain that control desire , to make a movie .
we &apos;re going to ban <unk> São Paolo .
this is a city that has not been put in place for the last five years without any identification , without any poster .
we went to the school district , where all the companies tried to put advertising into all the major schools in the United States .
and what blew my mind was , let me get the most feedback or the things that I got the biggest benefit of myself .
that &apos;s how the branding works .
they skip the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the idea is that it probably doesn &apos;t leave my interests at all .
I &apos;m going to play with artists .
I &apos;m going to make a very special film with him , and I &apos;m going to show you how we think about the world .
what does this mean for people ? does it work ?
the movie was on the <unk> , and we looked at it .
according to the Freedom of Information Act , the movie came out of January -- it &apos;s not the whole movie -- we get the media about 10 million pages of the movie .
it &apos;s all about two and a half weeks .
it &apos;s just the Internet -- it &apos;s not like <unk> , or television .
it wasn &apos;t even released .
there is no Internet online to watch .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
the last film has been received very broad attention .
it was a very good match for a film like this , and we were asked by an advertising agent , and they weren &apos;t participating .
I still believe that if you try and take risks , these risks become opportunities .
I believe that when you don &apos;t let people take chances , you &apos;re going to push them down .
I believe that when you &apos;re educating your employees , you &apos;re not going to risk taking a risk , you &apos;re putting the whole company in danger .
I think we need to make progress , we need to encourage people to take chances .
we have to encourage people not to be afraid of seemingly dangerous opportunities .
and finally , I think we have to confront fear .
you have to put that bear in a cage .
fear is face @-@ to @-@ face .
one bite , one is face @-@ to @-@ face .
and finally , we have to be transparent .
now , a little bit more faith than ever could have had a very strong life .
and I said , &quot; <unk> my whole talk through integrity and transparency , &quot; and my whole talk has been transparent to friends of mine in <unk> , and they &apos;ve been able to pay their speeches online for seven dollars .
<unk> : big data is a big opportunity for global entrepreneurship .
it &apos;s about embracing transparency .
thank you very much .
Jean : so , where is zero for zero dollars for transparency ?
<unk> <unk> : that &apos;s a wonderful question .
I have a check in my pocket that &apos;s the TED <unk> Foundation , and I have a check that my next year at TED .
my name is <unk> .
18 years ago , I had another job at Google , and I proposed this idea to try to do something in art and museum , and I still have a place to be here today .
it took 18 months .
I &apos;ve been through a lot of interesting negotiations and stories , and I can tell you about nine countries , and I &apos;ve been exposed to 17 wonderful museums .
but I want to focus on this one .
I can tell a lot of stories about why we &apos;re going to do this .
my personal story is very simple : how do I go into this slide ?
I grew up in India .
I got a good education , I didn &apos;t want to complain about , but I don &apos;t have a lot of opportunities for these museums and artwork .
so when I had the opportunity to travel around these museums , I learned a lot .
and when I was working on Google , I was able to participate in technology that made it easier for people to come up with .
so we created a team , a wonderful group , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to get into the demo and tell you a few interesting stories about a few of these projects .
so , very simply , you get to <unk>
you see all these museums .
you see the <unk> Museum , you see New York City Museum of Modern Art , the Netherlands , the National Museum .
now let me get to one of my favorites .
there are two ways it &apos;s very simple .
click , bang , you &apos;re in the museum .
wherever you are in Mumbai , Mexico , is fine .
you &apos;re walking around and you enjoy it .
you want to follow a line in the museum .
you click on it , you pop it up .
you go in , you want to go to the edge of the hallway .
keep going , getting happy .
explore .
thank you . I &apos;m not talking about the best part .
now I &apos;m facing my favorite painting by Peter <unk> .
I saw this plus .
if the museum gives us images , you click on it .
this is one of the images .
here &apos;s all the metadata data .
if you &apos;re really interested in this artwork , you can click here , but now I &apos;ll close it up .
this is an image that we &apos;re taking , and this is what we call the <unk> <unk> technology .
for example , this image is close to 100 million pixels .
a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you get from 100 billion cameras ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to show you what a 100 million digital camera gives you .
you can just shut down .
you see something interesting .
I love this guy . his face is valuable .
but you really want to go even further .
so I looked around and I saw what was going on here .
I said , &quot; Wait a minute , that &apos;s interesting . &quot;
close to that , I started noticing what these kids are throwing .
I studied it , and I talked to a couple of people in the museum , and it turned out that it was a game called <unk> , and it was a horrible <unk> on a <unk> day .
it &apos;s pretty popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did that , but I learned about <unk> .
now it gets deeper , and you can see the front row is up .
now let me show you a quick picture , and I &apos;ll close it up , and you can actually see all that .
this is where we are , and this is the painting .
the best one is not yet . wait .
now let &apos;s get to the Museum of Modern Art .
my other favorite : &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m going to give you an example of detail .
so what if you want to look at <unk> ?
if you want to see how this is creating this piece .
you zoom in . it &apos;s really big .
I got to my favorite bits , and I really can see the <unk> .
this is &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I thought , I never saw it .
I want to introduce you to another function that I love .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff . I don &apos;t have time to go through it .
this is one of the really cool parts . it &apos;s called a collection .
any of you , no matter whether you &apos;re rich or poor , whether you have a fancy house or not .
you can go in and build your own museum in these pieces .
it &apos;s very simple . you go in and I created this power called <unk> , and you can see it everywhere .
this is the icon of the National Museum .
you can write <unk> and send friends , and you can actually talk about how you can feel about the work .
so I thought , well , to me , the most important thing for me is that these remarkable works are not from Google .
I personally thought it was not a museum .
I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
it really came from these artists .
this is how I feel when I &apos;m in this process .
I mean , I want the digital media to be able to show their artwork properly .
and the biggest problem I &apos;ve got right now is , &quot; Would you like to replicate it ? &quot;
my answer is no .
it &apos;s a replacement experience .
I said , thank you .
thank you .
this is a map of the brain . your brain can be divided into two components .
the left , the main reason , the right brain , is held accountable .
if we measure the power of the brain &apos;s hemispheres , we can tag our brains .
so for example , this suggests that somebody is completely rational .
that means somebody &apos;s complete emotional .
so where do you put your brain online ?
some people might choose one of the extreme events , but I think most of you in the audience should be more similar -- two brains simultaneously have very high potential .
they don &apos;t seem to be <unk> or anything .
you can be rational and sensitive .
and I thought that I &apos;d been a very , very kindly connected to most other quantum physicist .
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to keep this going .
so how do we enhance that intuition ? well , we like to study things .
we study things and processes and we see how it responds , and then we increase our instinct .
you actually do the same thing .
some of the sensations that you might have been nurturing for years , such as a thing can only appear at the same time .
I mean , it &apos;s weird to think about a thing that can happen at the same time in two different places , but you &apos;re not born to this notion that you &apos;re in business .
I remember seeing a kid playing with a <unk> .
he was just a toddler and he was not good at this kid , and he fell down .
but I bet and <unk> play gives him a very valuable lesson , which is that large objects don &apos;t allow you to cross , and they stop in one place .
it &apos;s a very conceptual model in the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
it &apos;s also a very bad model for the particle physicist , because they don &apos;t study <unk> , and they study very little particles .
when they look at their particles , they think they &apos;re doing all kinds of really weird things -- like they can blur the wall , or they can come up at the same time .
they document these findings , and they call them quantum mechanics .
this is the edge of physics a few years ago ; you need quantum mechanics to describe tiny , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need it to describe the big , everyday objects .
it &apos;s not very intuitive to me , and it &apos;s probably due to the fact that I don &apos;t know very much about the particles .
well , I still work on them sometimes , but it &apos;s not the same .
and I never saw them .
I mean , nobody can see the particles .
but that doesn &apos;t match my logic .
because if everything is made of the particles , and each of the particles should follow the laws of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t all things be done by quantum theory ?
I couldn &apos;t find why it didn &apos;t follow .
so I know better about the whole thing , and if we use it in a way that tells us that everything is always following quantum theory .
not long ago , I started .
I made this .
this is the first product that you can see and the result of quantum mechanics .
what we see here is a computer chip .
in the middle , you can see the <unk> .
that is the metals that I &apos;m going to talk about in the next few days .
this is a picture of it .
focus a little . we see what &apos;s at the center .
this is a very close , very close @-@ up view .
what we &apos;re looking at is a piece of metal , its shape looks like a hot water box , and it stretch out its tip .
I &apos;ve made these metals nearly as well as making silicon .
I &apos;m operating on a silicon chip , and I &apos;m full of these large machines about 100 hours .
and for the end of that , I had to make my own machine at the bottom of this swimming pool .
this device has the ability to layer the quantum layer , but it needs some help to do that .
let me give you an example .
do you know how uncomfortable it is in a crowded elevator ?
I mean , when I was in the elevator , I could do all kinds of weird things , but when other people came in , I stopped doing these things because I didn &apos;t want to be happy , or , frankly , to everybody else .
so the laws of quantum mechanics seem to suggest that non @-@ living organisms have changed the same situation .
the passengers who don &apos;t live is not just the human , but it also includes the light of it , the heat and space inside .
so if we want to see the physical properties of quantum mechanics , we have to throw out all the other passengers .
that &apos;s what we did .
we turn the lights off , and we put it in a pot of steel , and we pull out all the air , and then we cool it down a little bit .
now , in the elevator , the little Ajax can do anything that it wants to do .
we measured the movement .
we found it works in very peculiar ways .
it &apos;s vibrating , not completely motionless , and <unk> , and it &apos;s like this -- like a <unk> jacket .
just to give it a slightly less impact , we can make it vibrate , and we can make it vibrate at the same time -- something that just happens in quantum mechanics .
what I &apos;m here to tell you about is something wonderful .
what does a thing vibrate and not <unk> ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
one example : all the atoms of the billion have been moving up and down at the same time .
it &apos;s only at specific times they &apos;re consistent .
the rest of the time they &apos;re <unk> .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , and further indicates that the whole field is in two places .
I think that &apos;s really cool .
it &apos;s true .
I &apos;ve been <unk> myself for all of these years because , look at the scale of this single atom and the <unk> and the <unk> of the individual atom and the <unk> and the <unk> of the individual .
so if the individual position is at the same time at the same time , then the dog can be in a different position , why can &apos;t you ?
I mean , it &apos;s just my logical logic .
so think about if you could be in more position , what would that look like ?
how do you know how to process your own <unk> territory ?
this is a part of the story .
when we heat it up , we open the lights , we see the green shoots are still one .
so I had to make a new intuition , and it seemed that all the objects in the elevator were actually stuck in a very tiny cosmos .
you &apos;ve heard a lot about how quantum physics is interconnected .
well , that &apos;s not exactly right .
it &apos;s bigger than that . it &apos;s more profound .
and it &apos;s this association that you &apos;re related to around you , and it really defines who you are , and that &apos;s the profound and amazing .
thank you .
in 2007 , I thought we needed to redefine the idea of economic development in our consciousness .
our new goals should be for every family to think about where they &apos;re working and where they &apos;re working , and they can have at least five different places where they can choose to be competitive new cities .
we have a long way to go .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t have a city willing to take their steps .
but the amazing thing about cities is that it &apos;s much more valuable than building value .
so we can easily build the world for hundreds of miles , or hundreds of kilometers .
you may think it sounds ridiculous if you &apos;ve never thought of it before .
but this is just a building to replace the city .
imagine half of the people who want to live in their apartment are already in their homes ; half of them haven &apos;t gone .
you can build the homes that have already been around to try to scale up .
but you know that the building that you &apos;re looking at and the surrounding site is legal protection for protecting its own private property and entertainment .
it &apos;s very hard to do these things .
but you can build a new building in the area without development , which is like the beginning of the <unk> .
so I propose that the government is good enough for the new cities and is called the Charter city .
I know about this at the same time that <unk> and <unk> <unk> are thinking about <unk> in Honduras .
it &apos;s said that about 70,000 people a year in the United States who are trying to figure out what they can do to keep these people in Honduras for the same task , living .
and one of the first ones said to the <unk> <unk> , &quot; What if we were to take a vacant land -- what if we were to give it to the embassy -- some American embassy that would give the US Army the American embassy ; if we wanted to find jobs in Canada or the U.S. government , what would they find their jobs , or the American embassy jobs ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , Honduras had a military coup .
in the next rule , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with the election speech , and the peace process won the overwhelming advantage of the overwhelming majority .
he invited the tower to <unk> as his <unk> .
and at the same time , I was preparing a TEDTalk .
through a series of improved <unk> , large masses of users , I tried to take this idea of a very complex concept of the city and compress it into the most fundamental essence of all .
the first is that the importance of law , as it said , is that you can &apos;t get into the households .
we &apos;re looking at new technologies , but new technologies require technological and demanding to execute , and often these efforts to pull us back .
in 2010 , a friend of mine sent a TEDTalk about this .
he showed it to the <unk> .
they called me the phone .
say , &quot; Let &apos;s show this to our president . &quot;
we had a meeting in December of Miami in a hotel room in Miami .
I tried to explain how much the city was worth and how much it was worth .
I showed you a graph of the value of a <unk> site in New York City , and notice , at some point , tens of thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it &apos;s a more abstract discussion , and when some <unk> tower says , &quot; Paul , maybe we can watch a TEDTalk . &quot;
in a very simple way , the Charter for which the city is a beginning of uninhabited , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is whether or not people choose to live in a single opportunity .
and the president of Honduras said to the question , &quot; We need this project , &quot; which is the key to bringing our nation forward .
I was invited to visit <unk> last April , May , to <unk> .
I &apos;ve shown you another example of this slide which has been tried to tell you about , if you want to make a big difference in the city , it has to be a big one .
this is a picture of <unk> <unk> , and this is a new airport in Denver .
this single airport is more than 100 square miles .
I tried to convince Honduras if you &apos;re going to build a <unk> that you &apos;re going to do at least 1,000 square miles .
it &apos;s bigger than 2,500 acres .
everybody &apos;s happy to be <unk> .
the face of the audience is serious and alarm .
and the president of the conference went to the conference and said , &quot; Well , thanks for your lectures , but maybe we can look at a TEDTalk .
I have it on my laptop now . &quot;
so I sat down , and they looked at a TEDTalk .
it also captures the essence of the new city and the choice .
it &apos;s a choice that you &apos;re going to go to , and maybe be in Honduras instead of the <unk> North .
it also gave leadership a new choice .
because the leaders of Honduras &apos; government need a universal help to get the benefit of those values to help them set up and implement the Charter in which each of them believe that the Charter will actually be obtained .
the realization of the President <unk> is the ability to ensure that I think the way to build a city that is compelling , that should be as important as the years of fear and doubt .
we field that area .
this is a picture there .
it &apos;s very easy for a thousand square kilometers .
and not long after , on the 19th of January , they voted on the Constitution in Congress to provide a legal support for specific development .
in this country where they had just experienced the last time , the government of parliament held that required that it was more than one .
all the parties have supported this .
as part of the Constitution , you actually have twice in Congress .
on the 17th of February , they passed the law again .
immediately after the voting , on the 21st of February , about 30 people of the delegation in the world came to two of the most interesting places in the world .
one is South Korea .
this is a big , new downtown town -- bigger than Boston .
all of the ones that you saw were built for four years , but they &apos;d been there for four years .
the other thing that really attracted the building was Singapore .
they &apos;re actually already building two <unk> in China and building a third .
and if you think about that in a rational way , that &apos;s where we are .
they have an infrastructure , and they &apos;ve been thinking about building it into two cities .
they &apos;re entering an legal process to allow the administrative management and to have a second legal system .
a country has been willing to make the Supreme Court accountable for the new justice system and become the final resort .
it &apos;s a very interested in urban designers and architects .
these can even bring some economic support to them .
but one of the things that you know about earlier is that there &apos;s a lot of badlands .
there &apos;s a lot of corporate action going into the United States specifically to the free trade zone , and a lot of people want to be there .
around the world there are seven billion people who want to be forever in certain places .
a million people go from Latin America every year .
many of them are the fathers who are looking for jobs -- sometimes single mothers to earn money for their families .
sadly , sometimes the kids are trying to get their parents for a long time , for decades , for decades , for them to be full .
how is this a vision of how this could be built in Honduras ?
or have you set up a tens of thousands of trees in the world ?
what about a vision of how to maintain each family with a number of competing cities ?
it &apos;s an idea worth spreading .
my friend of mine gave me a thank you for TED .
hello . I &apos;m a Kevin <unk> . I &apos;m the statistical manager of YouTube , and my field is to watch YouTube videos .
it &apos;s true .
so today we &apos;re going to talk about why some of the videos are going to be so important .
we all want to be a celebrity -- celebrity , singer , performer -- and when I was young , it was very , very difficult .
but now the Internet video allows it to be real @-@ time , so we can all be creative in order to do something famous , and then suddenly become part of the world culture .
all of you are famous on the Internet , on Saturday .
but there are over 48 hours of video a minute of YouTube .
in many cases , only the tiniest fraction of the people watch and watch and become a <unk> culture .
how did that happen ?
three keys : <unk> , community participation and unthinkable .
okay , let &apos;s see .
Mr. <unk> gas : Oh , my God . Oh my God . Oh my God .
Oh , my God !
ooh !
Oh , Wow !
last year , Mr. <unk> gas ran this video of a small park in his <unk> park .
in 2010 , the video was watched for three million times .
this graph shows that this video was just epidemic in the sky .
but the bear didn &apos;t take a video that was popular .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s called the &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s going to be done .
he also put up a lot of <unk> videos .
this video actually popped up last year .
so what happened ?
that &apos;s Jimmy <unk> .
Jimmy Kimmel takes the video and gives it a <unk> .
because there &apos;s a movement like Jimmy <unk> and it &apos;s a pioneer for us to introduce new and interesting things to the audience to get in touch with these things .
RNG : I &apos;m on Friday , Friday . play is on Friday . everyone &apos;s expected to go on weekends , weekends , Friday , Friday .
Rebecca <unk> : &quot; Friday &quot; was one of the Year &apos;s Eve .
this year has almost 200 million watch .
this graph shows the popular trends .
it &apos;s like the movie &quot; <unk> &quot; with the bear , and it &apos;s kind of like there &apos;s a sudden red cross .
what happened that day ?
Oh , that was the day , a Friday , really .
if you &apos;ve been wondering about the epidemic , it &apos;s all on Friday .
but what happened to this particular Friday day ?
it was chosen , and many of our tribes <unk> discussion .
Michael Moriarty was <unk> <unk> , and he was <unk> on Twitter .
the point is that there is a group of people who are looking at the end of the video and sharing their views , accelerating the video is red .
and it &apos;s a group of participatory jokes and sharing , not only to mention it , but to deflect its own version .
so now there are tens of thousands of <unk> on &quot; Friday . &quot;
there &apos;s a different twist on Monday .
unlike the 20th century entertainment media , it was a group of participation that allowed us to become a part of the common phenomenon -- spread or innovation .
this one &quot; <unk> &quot; is a continuum of music .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s up to 50 million people a year .
if you think that &apos;s amazing , you &apos;re more likely to imagine the video and the three @-@ hour version that draws four million people to watch .
it &apos;s even counterproductive .
the cat is watching the other cats .
but what &apos;s important about this is the technology that motivates creativity , the technology , the web culture .
we &apos;ve made <unk> .
somebody made a nostalgia .
and then comes the route .
the whole <unk> red , the whole remix , makes it a joke that everybody could play .
because now we are not only <unk> , we are involved in it .
who would have predicted this ?
who knows , &quot; <unk> &apos; or <unk> &apos; or &apos; worth of <unk> &apos; ?
what kind of script do you write will contain all this ?
it &apos;s about two days a minute of watching a web video that &apos;s unique and unthinkable for the video .
one of my friends strongly suggested a very good video was done by a guy in New York City , and I had to admit that I had no interest in it .
masters <unk> : I have a ticket because I don &apos;t have a bike , but often because a lot of obstacles don &apos;t allow you to be on a bike route .
KB : in a very unexpected way , the idea and the argument that resulted in 500 million people watching .
it works for every aspect of our innovation .
so we have a problem .
bear <unk> : what does that mean ?
Oh ...
KB : what does that mean ?
the wave , the creative collaboration , and the <unk> , these are the characteristics of new media and <unk> that people can participate in in order to define what the audience is .
as I do , it &apos;s a Justin Bieber and a <unk> from YouTube .
your ideas don &apos;t need to be generous .
we have autonomy in a popular culture .
but it &apos;s not the old media feature , it &apos;s not the whole story of today &apos;s media , but it &apos;s going to be the future of media play .
thank you .
10 minutes is enough for me to tell the story of the three women , the amazing forces of this bonds that four @-@ year @-@ old girls and her mother , together , five days old , a boat that &apos;s been waiting for 30 years , never been sitting in your head today -- today in San Francisco .
an ongoing story .
it &apos;s like a puzzle that &apos;s being painted .
allow me to tell you about the footage .
the first image in the back of it is a man that works as well .
he was a poet and a playwright that worked for the nation &apos;s unity and freedom .
imagine him being a communist , he &apos;s facing his whole life completely <unk> .
we are laughing with friends .
he silence .
he &apos;s dead .
he was my grandfather .
I never understood his true life .
but our lives are richer than memory .
my grandfather had given me his life .
and my responsibility was to keep his experience futile , and my responsibility was to learn from the past , the history of history trying to get us .
the next piece of the puzzle was the dawn of the morning , <unk> the sea .
my mother , <unk> , 18 @-@ year @-@ old , had two little girls .
for her , her only purpose was to flee the family in Australia .
it was impossible for her .
so , four years of <unk> &apos;s grand story of <unk> novels , a boat @-@ boat , a boat @-@ boat fishing .
big people know the danger .
the biggest threat was pirates , rape and death .
like all adults , my mother had a little poison .
if we are cremated , my sister , my mother , my mother and the grandmother .
my first memories are coming from the boat -- the motors , the <unk> , the flow of waves .
I don &apos;t remember pirates come up a few times , but the man on the boat is <unk> away , and the engine is turned around for six hours .
but I remember the light that came out of the road in Malaysia ; it was the young <unk> <unk> from Malaysia ; it was the first apple , a man from <unk> .
no longer to eat that delicious apple .
three months after the prison camp , we were there in Melbourne .
the next piece of the puzzle is a new life of women &apos;s generations .
it &apos;s a working @-@ class suburban , dominated by migration .
unlike the rest of the suburbs , I forget my existence , let alone the right .
the taste of the store as if it came from another world .
speaking of the same language , people are interacting with each other , and one thing is the same , and it &apos;s beginning to emerge .
the mother started working in the village , and then went to the car for six days a week , six days , <unk> .
sometimes she would learn English , she would get the I.T. <unk> .
we are very poor .
every dollar . the remaining money was used for <unk> English and mathematics , no matter what , no new clothing , no <unk> .
I went to my <unk> , I took a different hole .
the standards of school are tied to the lap because it &apos;s six years .
not very often , but a few <unk> , occasionally the graffiti says , &quot; <unk> in Asia , go home ! &quot;
where ?
something was <unk> me .
a force pulls in , quiet voice is saying , &quot; I &apos;m going to <unk> you . &quot;
I , my sister and my mother slept in a bed .
mothers are taking their families home every night , but we are talking to each other about the day , listening to the acoustic bedroom of the living room .
my mother was always perplexed , and it was all about boat .
my job is to be sober , wake up in her fine @-@ grained act .
she opened a computer store , she studied <unk> , she opened a <unk> .
the story of men , of course , is , of course , pissed off , kid , is like two worlds .
find money and funding .
it &apos;s the center .
I live in a parallel world .
on the one hand , I was a typical Asian student , I was very <unk> .
on the other hand , I was struck by the dangers , the violence , the <unk> and the apartheid regime .
but for so many years , help .
I was selected as a young Australian <unk> .
I just jumped from one snippet to another without a beautiful connection .
BMA has now been invited to speak about whether or not there is a place to be imagined .
I don &apos;t know the deal .
I don &apos;t know how to use <unk> .
you don &apos;t talk about wine .
it won &apos;t speak .
I want to go back to the original , anonymous , suburban living -- grandmother , two daughters that have been around for 20 years , talking about the past , reading about sleep , getting sleep in a bed .
I told my mother that I couldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that she took us a boat to go abroad , and it &apos;s my age right now .
no choice .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; she said , &quot; does true self . &quot;
so I talked about the struggle and the education and the indifference of the group and the struggle of politics .
the more honest I was talking about , I was invited to speak .
people around them are doing what they like , what they live .
even though I &apos;d done my studies , I realized I couldn &apos;t limit law .
here &apos;s another piece of the puzzle .
at the same time , I realized that as an outsider can , the news on the screen was not just possible , but something happened to a boat .
because it &apos;s too easy to abandon your vision , it &apos;s easy to get your hypothesis .
I &apos;ve got to stand now in the comfort zone , and yes , the world starts fragmented , not exactly what you &apos;re worried about .
it &apos;s not allowed to allow the <unk> or to amplify the possibility .
it &apos;s got energy , pure optimism , mixed with the human spirit and the courage .
follow my hunch .
I gathered together a group that couldn &apos;t do the only thing we could do .
for a year , we can &apos;t do it .
and at the end of the day , I did a big job of sharing .
it works every night .
most of our ideas are crazy , and a few of them are very good , and we &apos;ve breakthrough .
I think I move to the United States .
after a trip .
my intuition has succeeded .
I went to three months , and I continued to take a ride .
at the end , let me say my grandmother .
she grew up in the middle of a massive epidemic , and she was the largest <unk> .
a few centuries of life has never changed .
she was born , and her father died .
the mother raised alone .
she was 17 years old and married a <unk> , made of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
there was no husband &apos;s support , taking the husbands to the court , to <unk> her , to win the Nobel Prize , to become a <unk> .
impossible is possible .
when she died in Melbourne in 600 miles away , I was in a hotel in Sydney .
through the glass , I saw her standing across the line .
I know that she was happy .
my mother &apos;s phone rang a few minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a <unk> , sat next to her coffin .
we tell the story and tell her we keep with her .
and the night watchman had told us that he had to cover the coffin .
my mother made us feel the grandmother &apos;s hand .
she said , &quot; Why is it that the grandmother &apos;s hand is Van <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been <unk> from the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you never let go . &quot;
if we have mobility in our family , it must be women .
if we think about the shape of our own and our life , we can now see that a man has to frustrated us . we have to be frustrated .
it &apos;s easy to fail .
now I want my baby , my boat .
who would not ?
but I was afraid of privilege , privilege , power and power .
<unk> their life , brave <unk> each wave , naturally , ultra @-@ <unk> , <unk> vision , generous vision , can I do that ?
I don &apos;t know .
but I can let it look at their safety , and that &apos;s what I hope .
and at the same time , what &apos;s going on here today is the fourth , the fourth , the <unk> .
I want to share with you today a little bit about my photography .
or is this a photographic work ?
because , obviously , this is a photograph , but it &apos;s not like you &apos;re taking a camera .
however , my interest in photography started when I got my first digital camera , I was 15 years old .
it was about my passion for painting , but it was a little different , because the whole process of using the camera is already ahead .
when you pick up the camera , the whole process is over .
so it seems to me that photography is more about fitting time and time .
I think anyone can do this .
so I want to do something special , especially when you press your shoot , the whole process is just beginning .
for example , this is a busy road building .
it &apos;s not surprising .
and yet , it &apos;s still a sense of what it &apos;s like .
or a picture like this is both <unk> and color , but it &apos;s all about trying to preserve a sense of being a compliment .
I mean , what I &apos;m talking about here is the image of the picture .
because it &apos;s not something you can actually hold , but I always wanted to make it look like a way to get some traction out .
these pictures need to be able to quickly figure out the tricks behind them .
so what &apos;s more important is capturing an idea instead of capturing a moment of reality .
but what does it look like to make these pictures look realistic ?
is it about detail ? is it about color ?
is it about light ?
what made this illusion ?
sometimes a different perspective causes different visions .
but ultimately , it &apos;s not just that we can understand the world and how we understand it in a two @-@ dimensional space .
it &apos;s not about what it &apos;s about , it &apos;s about what we think looks like .
so I think these basic principles are simple .
I think of it as a mystery in the real world , where you can put different pieces of the real world together and create a real reality .
let me give you a very simple example .
there are three totally <unk> and real objects , and we can find them in real three @-@ dimensional worlds .
but if you combine these objects together in a certain way , you can create visual objects that are still three @-@ dimensional objects , like it &apos;s possible .
but it &apos;s also clear that it &apos;s not possible .
and we &apos;re cheating our brains , because the brain is not going to have that reality .
the same is true of the <unk> .
it &apos;s just a different picture of reality .
so what makes a picture look like is something that we normally don &apos;t even think about , but something that &apos;s out there .
but when we do that , it &apos;s worth thinking about it , or it looks a bit more bizarre .
I want to say that we are going to follow three simple principles in order to achieve what it looks like .
you see , these images are not special .
but together , they can create this .
so the first rule is that all of the photographs that are labeled in the same way .
second , there &apos;s also the same light that &apos;s labeled as a result .
both of these photographs were exactly the same , and they were asked to do the same amount of filming and identical light .
and the third principle is that it &apos;s difficult to get people to see the bridge , and it &apos;s going to make the bridge look like these .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense to anybody .
by matching the colors of the surfaces , the <unk> and the <unk> of the lens , the depth of the depth and the noise of the eye , we can take away the boundary between a different picture and make it look like a single photograph , even if a picture contains hundreds of photos .
here &apos;s another example .
some of you may think that this is just a piece of <unk> , and that &apos;s part of the process .
but this picture is actually all of the photographs that are taken from different places .
and I personally think that creating a place that is easier than finding a place , because you don &apos;t have to have anything to your brain .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and when I came up with this idea last winter , I knew I had a couple of months to design this thing , and it was basically to go to a different place to find a picture of what the problem was required .
for example , this fish was <unk> from the sky .
the shore is taken at another location .
the underwater part was a quarry .
by the way , I took the island and turned it into red , which made it look more wind .
in order to achieve what that looks like , I think the most important thing is to plan .
it always comes up with the idea and the idea .
and this is a different picture .
every one of these pictures is taken carefully .
if you can get a good picture , it works beautifully . it &apos;s very nice .
so actually all the tools are within that limit , what &apos;s our imagination .
thank you .
I &apos;d like to talk to you about a number of reasons why digital healthcare programs failed .
and one of the things that I think is important is that we don &apos;t listen to patients .
one of the things we did at the Netherlands is we commissioned a <unk> to listen to .
it &apos;s not science in a very scientific way -- she &apos;s going to have a coffee or a teas , and the question is , &quot; Okay , ma &apos;am ?
what does it take for us ? &quot;
and I think we &apos;re willing to think that this is one of the main reasons why almost all digital healthcare programs fail , which is that we don &apos;t listen to .
it &apos;s a very simple thing that my weight gain is .
there &apos;s a switch .
I weigh it every morning .
well , I set myself a duet , which you can see .
I set the limit on the weight .
in fact , the whole operation was so simple that I could get my data to Google Health .
at the same time , my close @-@ up doctor could be received , and he could look at what the problem was , instead of having a heart attack like a heart attack , the weight would come back and forth .
but here &apos;s another one .
some of you may know that I have a big fan on Twitter .
so every morning , I <unk> weight , and before I get in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you &apos;re lunch today , or Jenn . &quot;
but that &apos;s great because it &apos;s peer @-@ to @-@ peer pressure stress , and it helps patients -- it helps with obesity .
but on the other hand , it can bring people together in some kind of game @-@ like games to make it better .
the next week , the next week has to be lost .
there &apos;s a little <unk> that connects to the smartphone or other installations .
and then people would take their blood pressure and send it to their doctor &apos;s doctor , and they would share it with you a hundred dollars .
and that is the key , when the patient is collecting data , not only can they self @-@ control , but it can help us deal with the challenges in health care , like the health care or the need to multiply and so on .
we &apos;ve got to get technology in order to motivate the patients that are already in orbit .
you can do it through technology like this and you can distribute it to ordinary people .
today I &apos;m going to show you a project that we did .
we have instruments in our cars .
even the cell phone .
we know where the Schwarzschild radius is .
you know where all the gas stations are .
of course , fast food .
but where &apos;s the closest vehicle to saving the patient &apos;s vehicle ?
we &apos;re everywhere , and nobody knows .
nobody knew what was going to happen to his life .
we &apos;re going to be sent to the Dutch mission .
we built a website that told people , &quot; If you look at a liberal <unk> , please mark it on the Internet and open time , &quot; because it &apos;s not always open for 24 hours .
in the Netherlands , the Netherlands is labeled .
the next step is to develop appropriate apps .
we developed an iPad .
a <unk> app , <unk> <unk> , to find <unk> .
if you saw someone fail in Boulder , you could use an iPhone in a couple of weeks , and Microsoft phone phones could find the closest life to saving lives .
what I &apos;d like to talk about today is not just the name of the product , but the name of the <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;re going to move this out into the world .
and we &apos;re also calling to colleagues and universities around the world to help us think together to make sure that we can all of the world &apos;s labels .
so when you go out and see someone who &apos;s dead , maybe your family , or your way out , you can find someone who &apos;s dead .
and here we have the appeal to every company in the world to help us test these <unk> .
for example , maybe sending a <unk> or a <unk> to see if the name is still there .
so to help us with this project , not only to health , but to put it back together , to get better .
thank you .
today , I &apos;m going to talk about some surprising discoveries .
now I work in the sun .
and I was just a little company that was trying to force us into a natural way of looking at it .
attention can be done .
this video is showing what we &apos;re doing .
<unk> , wait .
it takes time .
maybe we can skip -- I &apos;ll skip the video .
don &apos;t .
it &apos;s not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
no , my time has gone ?
well , thank you very much .
a few years ago , I started a project that had some incredible design and design people who were supposed to represent everything they wanted to be -- government , a year of work .
this project is called &quot; The <unk> of America , &quot; kind of like a <unk> .
we take a few people a year and we make them work for the government .
not to send them to the third world , but to turn them into the city hall .
there they created a good app and worked with the city .
but what they &apos;re really doing is to show the possibility that technology can create today .
this is Josh .
Al is a fire hydrant .
it looks like it &apos;s waiting for a date , but what it &apos;s really waiting for is a human being that can be <unk> when it &apos;s lined up , because it knows when it &apos;s four feet of snow , its ability to melt down .
how does it work in a particular way ?
last year we said , &quot; The United States has a team in <unk> .
they were in February , and it was a lot of them last year .
they noticed that the fire of this city was hardly designed .
and one of the people that worked on that team was called Erik <unk> , and the other thing that came up with was that the citizens would knock out the front of the fire hydrant .
so he did what any good programmer would do , and he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a lovely program for you to adopt a fire hydrant .
and then you agree that it would open up in the snow .
if you did that , you could give it a name ; he called this first Al Gore .
but if you don &apos;t know it , other people can steal it from you .
so it has some little fun inside .
this is a relatively small program .
it may be the smallest act of the team that wrote that year .
but it did something other government couldn &apos;t do .
it &apos;s like a virus .
one of the guys who worked in Honolulu in Hawaii in Honolulu , in Honolulu , is seeing this program and realizing that it doesn &apos;t have to be used for it to be able to use it to make the citizens of the protests .
the effects of the tsunami are important , but people are stealing the batteries inside them .
so he allowed the citizens to examine them .
and then Seattle decided to use it to clean up the <unk> , to clean the <unk> .
the Chicago started to use it to get people out of the <unk> .
we now know there are nine cities to use it .
it just <unk> , organically , spread out .
if you know something about government , you know , it &apos;s not universal .
it takes a few years to build a software .
last year we had a team of three and a half months of working on a project .
it can help parents decide which public government is best for their children .
and then we were told , if this project works , it would take at least two years , and it would take about two million dollars .
and this is just a small number .
the city of California is about a project that costs 20 billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are all kinds of projects in government .
so a program that only takes a few days to program , and works like a virus , is a alarm for government institutions .
it &apos;s seen that government can be more efficient -- but not more like private , like so many people think .
it &apos;s not even a technology company , it &apos;s more like the web itself .
it means you don &apos;t have to give them permission ; it &apos;s available .
and this is very important .
but what this does represent , and more importantly , is that the new generation of people are looking at the problem of government as a group of issues , asking for solutions , not as a form of organization .
and this is good information , because , as it turns out , we are very good at digital technologies .
now there &apos;s a very large group of people who are building things that will make us much more efficient .
it &apos;s not just the &quot; American <unk> &quot; employees , but hundreds of people around the country have daily code and code their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they were very disappointed about it , but they didn &apos;t <unk> , and they were trying to improve it .
these people know something we &apos;ve lost .
and that is , when you peel away all the <unk> of our anger , like the feeling of politics , and at the top of the FDA , the government , at the center of it , says , &quot; The government can achieve something for us . &quot;
there are a lot of people who are totally <unk> about the government .
if you &apos;re one of them , I want you to take a second , because a lot of things are changing .
politics has not changed , but governments are changing .
and because of the power of government , the power of the most fundamental comes from our people , how we see it will affect its change .
when I started this project , I didn &apos;t know much about government .
it &apos;s like a lot of people , I think the government is just a selection department .
two years later , I got a realization . government , particularly local governments , is about .
this is the center of service and information recall The Center .
if you call the &quot; <unk> &quot; in your city , you &apos;re going to be connected to it .
if you &apos;re going to get a chance to work at the center of your town , like the colleague of our project -- in fact , they &apos;re all going to have to do this service -- you &apos;ll find people to call a very different problem for their own government , including cooking a government .
Scott got this call .
he put the word &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official <unk> .
nothing . he started with the animal control center .
and at the end , he said , &quot; Well , you can open your door open up , and then you have a loud music , and then you can see if it &apos;s going to go away ? &quot;
and that worked . Scott , <unk> .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the story .
we have no central nodes .
it has a program , a website and mobile application , called citizens connectivity .
we didn &apos;t write the program .
it &apos;s a group of very clever people writing in a new town in <unk> .
there was a day -- this is a real report -- the message was put up : &quot; there is a bin in the bin that doesn &apos;t see whether it &apos;s dead .
how can I get this out ? &quot;
citizens have a different approach to this problem .
Scott had a conversation about people .
but it &apos;s freely open @-@ minded , so everyone can see .
this time , a neighbor sees it .
the next report we received was , &quot; I passed the site and found the garbage in the back of the house .
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; I &apos;m alive . &quot;
put the garbage away , go home .
say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
so that &apos;s good . that &apos;s the reality and the digital world .
it &apos;s also a very good example of how government plays an <unk> game .
but it &apos;s also a very good example of how government works .
and I &apos;m not here to say the definition of a platform .
I just want to mention a platform that lets people help each other .
a citizen helped another citizen , and the government plays a role in it .
it &apos;s going to be two <unk> .
it can be used by government services to help the people that need it , but a neighbor is far more simple and effective .
when one of the neighbors helped another , our social relationships can be enhanced .
we call the &quot; control control control &quot; a lot of money .
one of the things that we need to think about is that the government is different from politics .
a lot of people understand this , but they still think politics is the input of government .
we have input from the government system through the ballot .
so far , how much political leadership is -- and at some point , we spend a lot of energy trying to support a new political leader -- and we &apos;re expecting government to do something that we need , but not so much change ?
it &apos;s because governments are like a big ocean , and politics is just the top .
and here &apos;s what we call a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
we talk about the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but it &apos;s this kind of bouncy with the things that we have and pay to keep in mind that we are losing our energy .
people seem to think that politics is sexy .
if we want the department to serve us , we have to make it sexy .
because the real government is there .
we have to be part of the government .
and this is what the U.S. Security Council does .
have you met these people ?
they were a very wealthy citizen , and they wrote a very detailed , about half @-@ page report to the U.S. Capitol Hill at the request of financial reform .
it &apos;s not about engagement , it &apos;s about engagement .
now , for those of us who have already given up government , it &apos;s time to ask ourselves what kind of world we want to leave our children .
you have to realize that they have to have a huge challenge .
before we don &apos;t improve our institutions , do we really think we can achieve what we want ?
we can &apos;t have government . we need it to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is meant to be able to reinvent the function of government by which we can build our citizens .
now the next generation is growing up in the Web , and they know it &apos;s not too hard to build the system .
our average age was 28 years old , so I was very tired , almost more than most of them .
this generation has been used to it .
they don &apos;t have to go through our generation about who can have free speech ; they all have free speech .
they can do that through any channel at any given time .
so when they face the flaw in the government , they don &apos;t care about using their own voice .
they use their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write programs that make government better .
and these programs allow us to use our own hands to improve our society .
it could have been designed for a fire hydrant , a grass , or a could put in a garbage bin .
and of course , a lot of people have started to break a fire safely .
but these programs are like a small alarm clock , and you can tell us that it &apos;s not just consumers ; we &apos;re not just Chinese spending ; we &apos;re paying taxes ; we &apos;re paying royalties .
we &apos;re not just this , we &apos;re citizens .
before improving the government , we have to take responsibility as citizens .
so I &apos;m here to leave you with a question : when we &apos;re faced with a big , important , and we need to do something together , we &apos;re going to have a group of individuals , or are we going to be a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be a <unk> group of people ?
thank you .
because I &apos;ve always been explaining to people how wonderful this new technology is going to come , and I think since I &apos;m with the <unk> , it makes me say that my real idea and trying to understand how this is going to happen and understand how it &apos;s going to happen , it seems like we can &apos;t catch it .
let me start with a very boring science slide .
and you can start the slide .
this is just a random sample of my documents .
what I want you to look at is not the detail , but the whole form .
this is a slide that we did on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with local power analysis .
interestingly , the <unk> slide , which we &apos;re familiar with , is a straight line on a semi @-@ log graph .
so every layer here represents the level of performance at the scale .
it &apos;s very fresh .
it &apos;s kind of weird .
it &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to say .
take the lights off .
and I &apos;m going to make the highlights because I &apos;m going to use the ink .
why do we use a <unk> curve of technology ?
well , the answer is , if I use the ordinary curve , we say , this is the year , this is the time that I &apos;m prepared to make some kind of measurement of technology , which is a bit silly .
it &apos;s kind of like this .
and it doesn &apos;t provide any information .
now , if I do , for example , another technology like transportation , which looks like transportation , on a semi @-@ log plot , it looks like a <unk> line .
but if that happens , it &apos;s not the case .
if transportation advances are as fast as the fossil advances , then I can have a taxi that goes into Tokyo in 30 seconds .
but it &apos;s not moving fast .
there is no self @-@ sustaining in technology &apos;s history , doubling every year .
now I want to ask you , if you look at these exponential curves , they &apos;re not going to last forever .
things can &apos;t change that fast .
two things happen .
it &apos;s going to be a typical S @-@ like trajectory that goes all the way to a very different situation , or it &apos;s going to be like this .
that &apos;s all possible .
now I &apos;m an optimist , so I think it &apos;s possible to be like this .
if that is true , it means that we are at the moment in time .
we seem to be on this line , in the world , from the past to the future .
all I have to ask , I &apos;ve been asking myself , where is the world going ?
what is the age of this new era ?
because this change seems very , very confused , when we &apos;re in it .
when I was a kid , the future was like 2000 , and people were discussing what was going to happen in 2000 .
now , at this conference , you &apos;re talking about the future , and you can see whether this is the year 2000 .
that &apos;s how much we can get there .
in other words , the future of my life is declining .
I think the reason is that we all feel what &apos;s going on .
the change is happening . we can all notice .
we know that for the next three , 50 years , 50 years , because everything is so different that it &apos;s not going to be meaningful in the future .
so I &apos;m going to talk about how that can be changed .
and to do that , I have to introduce a whole bunch of things that are very different from technology and computers .
because the only way I decided to understand this is to go back and redefine the timeline .
and I &apos;m going to look at the timeline of life on Earth .
I think this picture makes sense if you look at it for billions of years .
so if you look back in about 25 billion years , the Earth is so big , barren rock with some chemicals on it .
if we look at how these chemicals combine , we start to understand how they form .
I think there &apos;s some theories about how life started in RNA , but I want to tell you a very simple story about life , which is that , at that time , there &apos;s a <unk> oil flowing around , and there &apos;s all kinds of chemicals in it .
some oil droplet has a particular chemical composition that causes it to grow from the outside world and become larger .
it starts to differentiate , like this .
the most primitive of all , in some sense , formed cells , these little oil droplet oil .
but these oil prices are not real alive now , because every one of them is chemical random .
every single one divided , it &apos;s not the normal <unk> chemistry .
so each droplet has a little different .
in fact , the oil droplet is made for them to be able to integrate the compound around them , to grow larger , to divide more .
so they &apos;re more effective , they &apos;re more expressive .
it &apos;s a bit like a very simple chemical form of life , but the process becomes interesting when these oil prices learn a powerful skill .
we don &apos;t know how to make a fully understood way that these <unk> have learned about information .
they learn to make the secret of the cells into a specific substance called <unk> .
in other words , they came up with this kind of evolutionary way that you could write down the genetic information so that it could be replicated .
and the amazing thing is that this type of recording seems to be replicated about 25 million years ago .
in fact , our genes are exactly the same code , same way .
in fact , any organism is recorded with identical letters and code .
in fact , one of the things that I do is just for fun is we can document events .
I have a hundred @-@ dollar cabin , and I try not to find them in the airport .
but what I have in there is code , what I do is I take this code , and it has the criteria that we use to tag it , and I write my business card to an oxygen that goes to 100 times the size of 100 to 17 times .
so if anyone needs millions of my business card , I have enough to get everyone in this room , or even everyone around the world , right here .
if I &apos;m a very proud person , I &apos;m going to put it in a virus to a room .
so what &apos;s next ?
it &apos;s a fun step to document .
it causes the cells -- it &apos;s happy for billions of years .
but there &apos;s also a really interesting component that starts to become very different , and that is that these cells start exchanging and communicating information and forming cell groups .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , that bacteria can actually trade to oxygen .
that &apos;s why , for example , the evolutionary <unk> .
some bacteria know how to get away from penicillin , and then it creates this kind of <unk> information , and it goes around in other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacterial bacteria for penicillin , because bacteria are going to be able to communicate information .
so , these communication communities form , in a sense , they &apos;re <unk> with one boat ; they &apos;re cooperative .
so they &apos;re both surviving or they &apos;re dying together , which means that if a community is successful , all individuals in all communities can replicate more , evolution is much more positive .
so , the transition is transformed , and when these groups are very close , in fact , they are all gathered together and decided to write the elements of the entire community .
the next interesting stage in life is over billions of years .
in this period , there &apos;s a whole range of cells , which are very diverse , as a organism .
in fact , we are these cells .
we have a lot of cells ; they &apos;re no longer just for themselves .
the skin doesn &apos;t work . if you don &apos;t have the heart , the muscle cells , the brain cells , etc .
so these groups are beginning to evolve so interesting evolution is no longer just single cells , but what we call the organism .
and this is what happens in these groups .
these cells , again , start to extract information .
they start building very specific structures within the community .
these are the neurological structures .
so neurons are the information processing that these cells build .
in fact , the community is beginning to appear experts and track specific structures , understanding information .
this is the brain and nervous system of these cells .
this gives them evolutionary sense of evolution .
because then , for every individual -- learning can happen in a single organism , not the entire evolutionary time .
so an organism can , for example , learn some kind of fruit , because it &apos;s not good for the last time .
this could happen in a single organism &apos;s life , and then , before this particular information processing structure , it had to evolve thousands of years of learning to die from this fruit cell .
so the nervous system has built this particular structure that has accelerated evolution .
because evolution can happen in individuals at this point .
it can happen over time .
but what happened next was that every single individual discovered , of course , the secret of communication .
for example , the most sophisticated version we know is human language .
think about it as a wonderful invention .
I have a very complicated , chaotic , chaotic thought .
I &apos;m sitting here , basically <unk> , hoping to build a sort of chaotic chaos in your head .
but we &apos;re turning complex things into sound , through a series of sounds , and creating very complicated things in your brain .
so it &apos;s now pushing us into a single organism .
so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humans , begin to <unk> .
we &apos;re going through the same stages of multi @-@ cellular organism -- extract the document , the way we process information .
for example , the invention of language is very small steps .
the phone , the computer , the <unk> , etc . , are the special mechanisms that we are creating in society to deal with information .
all of this is about connecting us together , changing faster , and more empowered than we had before .
so now , evolution can happen on a subtle <unk> scale .
you see that little example of evolution that you see in front of you , it sort of shows a little bit of evolution in the back of your eye .
so now we &apos;re going to speed up time .
the first step that I &apos;m telling you is that it took billions of years .
next , like the nervous system and the brain , it costs millions of years .
and then , like language and so on , you can &apos;t get a million years .
the next step , like the <unk> , is like a decades .
the process is self @-@ sustaining and turning , and , I guess , the self @-@ obsession is more at the speed of change .
the faster the change is the change .
I think that &apos;s what we see here .
we see the process giving back to ourselves .
I work now on my own computer , and I know that the mechanisms for designing a computer are not possible without a recent advance .
now , what I &apos;m doing is designing complex and improbable objects for design .
I don &apos;t know how to connect to machines .
there are billions of dollars .
in fact , what I &apos;m doing is thinking about machine designers , what we think is a kind of information , and then we can get it to the machine , and the machine can go beyond what we can do , and it &apos;s much more than what we used to do .
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s used , we don &apos;t know very well .
and one of the interesting things that I &apos;ve been using recently is evolution itself .
what we do is we put a evolutionary process in the machine , which happens in a subtle number of time .
for example , in most extreme cases , we can actually start a program with random instructions .
&quot; computer , please produce a billion random instructions .
now you &apos;re going to run all of these random indicators , running all the programming and pick the one that I want . &quot;
in other words , I define what I want .
suppose I have to <unk> the data , which is a very simple example of what I &apos;ve experimented with .
find the most close @-@ to @-@ source programmers .
and of course , the random sequence is very unlikely , so none of them can do it .
but there &apos;s one in the middle , and it &apos;s good , and it &apos;s probably going to take two numbers .
I said , &quot; computer , please pick up 10 percent of the sequence .
keep this up . the rest of it .
now to replicate the data blocks best of all .
to replicate them like this .
take two programs to exchange their children , and these kids inherit the characteristics of two programs .
so I got a new generation of programmers doing well .
say , &quot; Let &apos;s do this process . &quot;
do it again .
it could be a bit of a mutation .
try it out in a new generation .
every generation of programmers need just a few milliseconds .
so I can do that on a computer for a couple of minutes as equals the evolution of millions of years , or , in a matter of hours .
at the end of the day , I got the absolute <unk> program .
in fact , these programs are much more effective than my hand .
now , if I read these programs , I don &apos;t know how they work .
I tried to read and explain how they work .
they &apos;re abstract , they &apos;re weird .
but they can do the task .
in fact , I know , I &apos;m confident that they can do the task , because they come from a line of tens of millions of programmers .
in fact , their life is the work .
I once sat with <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he pulled out a card and said , &quot; Look , look at this .
it says , &quot; The flight has a lot of very sophisticated components to keep you safe . &apos; is it going to make you confident ? &quot;
in fact , we know that engineering complexity doesn &apos;t work very well .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a very different process .
it allows us to produce something more complicated than normal projects .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the choices .
in a sense , the computer is far ahead of us .
we &apos;re using these software now to create faster computers so that we can run the process faster .
so it &apos;s self @-@ feedback .
and it &apos;s getting faster , and that &apos;s why I think computers seem to be very encouraging .
all of these technologies give back to themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and we &apos;re just at one point in time , and it &apos;s kind of like a single cell organism that &apos;s turning into multiple cells .
we &apos;re like amoebas . there &apos;s nothing we &apos;re creating .
we are at the turning point .
but I think there must be something that goes with us .
I think it &apos;s a very well @-@ known thing that we are the ultimate product of evolution .
I think all of us are part of reproduce , whatever next .
it &apos;s going to happen , and I &apos;m not picked up , and I think I &apos;m going to end up here .
it &apos;s a great pleasure to be here .
I spend most of my time in prison , in prison , on death row .
I spend most of my time in low @-@ income communities working in a very toxic place , working in a very poor neighborhood .
and today at TED , I saw these fascinating speeches giving me the <unk> .
and in that brief time , I noticed that TED has its own place .
you can see what &apos;s going on here is affected the world .
sometimes , when something happens at TED , it &apos;s a little more interesting than something else .
I mention this because I think self @-@ position matters .
we &apos;ve heard some amazing speeches .
we &apos;ve learned that as a teacher , you have influence , and if you &apos;re a very charitable teacher , you &apos;re willing to be careful .
as a doctor , you can help people , if you &apos;re a medical doctor , you can help more .
so I want to talk about the importance of positioning .
I don &apos;t learn from being a lawyer or doing other projects .
I actually learned from my grandmother .
my family was a traditional black family , and it was one of my grandmother .
she &apos;s resilient , she &apos;s strong .
she has a fight , she has an influence .
but a lot of things happened to her .
her parents were the true <unk> .
in the &apos; 40s , her parents were <unk> .
my grandmother was a born in the &apos; 80s , and her parents had been taken away by slavery , and she looked at the world .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was a <unk> .
when I was a little boy , every time she saw me embracing me .
and she &apos;s holding so close that I can &apos;t get there , and she can untie me .
one or two hours later , when I was goodbye , she would come and ask me , &quot; Can I feel my hug ? &quot;
if I say , &quot; I don &apos;t feel anything , &quot; she goes back to me until I say , &quot; <unk> me .
she &apos;s the ability to get close to her .
the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of 10 .
it &apos;s often hard for me to get close to Grandma when I go close to my grandmother .
my lips are everywhere .
I remember , when I was tired , I woke up in the morning , and I ran all the tarps .
my grandmother sat on the other side of the room and looked at me .
at first I thought we were playing games .
I went back and I smiled , but my grandmother was serious .
about 150,000 or so later , she stood up for 20 minutes , she walked through the room and she said to me , &quot; Look , Brian , we have to talk about it . &quot;
this is what happened yesterday .
I &apos;ll never be alone .
she took me to the side and she said , &quot; I want to say something you &apos;re not supposed to say to anybody . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , my grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> &apos;t say anything . &quot; I said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we sat down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to see me for a while . &quot;
and she said , &quot; You &apos;re a special kid . &quot;
she said , &quot; I &apos;m sure you can do anything . &quot;
I &apos;ll never forget that .
and she said , &quot; I want you to give me three things . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay my grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; first , I want you to make sure you &apos;re going to love your mother forever . &quot;
she said , &quot; Your mother is my <unk> , you have to make sure you &apos;re going to love her forever . &quot;
I love my mother , and I said , &quot; Okay , my grandmother , I will . &quot;
and she said , &quot; The second thing is that you have to agree that you &apos;re going to go forever , even if it &apos;s hard to go . &quot;
I thought , &quot; Okay my grandmother , I &apos;ll . &quot;
and she said , &quot; The third thing , I want you to keep breathing . &quot;
I was nine years old and I said , &quot; Okay , my grandmother , I promise . &quot;
I grew up in the south of my village , and I had a brother , and I had a little sister , and I had a one @-@ year @-@ old .
when I was five years old , my brother took me back to the <unk> beer -- I don &apos;t know how he got -- he took me and my sister , he ran into the woods .
and he was like , this is crazy .
he drank a drink of beer and handed me my sister , and she ate me .
I said , &quot; I don &apos;t want it . you drink it . I don &apos;t drink . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; Look , we all have a drink in the face of a poem that we have today .
I drank a little , and I got a little baby , and you got a taste . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want to drink . you drink it . &quot;
my brother was <unk> .
ask , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? drink a little more . &quot;
and then he looked at me for a second , and he said , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re not going to think about my grandmother as you &apos;re going to make sure . &quot;
I said , &quot; What are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; <unk> and every nut says he &apos;s special . &quot;
I &apos;m sad .
now I want to make a confession to you .
maybe not .
because the talk is everywhere .
and I &apos;m just going to give you a sense of that I &apos;ve never had a drop of beer .
it &apos;s not for me to tell you how ethical it is for me .
when we decide the right place , we can get the world to accept what they don &apos;t expect .
we can make the world do what they thought was impossible .
and when I was thinking about my grandmother , she was , of course , every woman was very special .
my grandfather was banned to go to jail .
I &apos;m not just a uncle dying and drunk disease .
these principles are all of my grandmother , and I think we should be .
what I want to talk to you about is our criminal justice system .
it has changed a lot over 40 years .
in 1972 , only 300,000 people in prison .
today , there are 880 .
today the United States is the most infected country in the world .
we have seven and a half million people in Stage One .
it seems to me that such a large number of crimes have completely changed our world .
in poor communities , in color communities , despair is transformed by these changes .
a third of all the black men and women between 30 and 30 percent are not in jail , they &apos;re in a state of affairs , or they &apos;re in <unk> .
it &apos;s all over the country -- Los Angeles , Baltimore , D.C. -- 50 to 60 percent of the young people who are in jail , not in jail , in <unk> , or in <unk> .
our justice system is not only changing , it &apos;s distorted , it &apos;s <unk> around race .
the justice system in this country will tell you that if you &apos;re a certified rich man , not a poor person .
wealth , not <unk> , determines the end result .
but what about it ?
playing with fear and anger , the wrist convinced us .
<unk> .
I &apos;m interested in this .
and we can look at daily changes .
I &apos;m in Alabama , like a lot of other states , if you &apos;re a convicted of your political power .
now , four percent of black men in Alabama are never going to vote .
we &apos;re going to see a decade ahead of us , and we &apos;re going to take away the political ratio and vote according to the same rate .
but nobody talked about half the words .
I represent children .
a lot of my contemporaries was young .
the United States is the only country in the world holding 13 @-@ year @-@ old children in imprisonment .
my country is a lifelong struggle for life , not <unk> .
we &apos;re actually just trying to get these people appeal .
the world is just one .
I was a victim of death row .
the death penalty was alarming .
the fundamental problem that we learn from things like that is that people are writing their own crimes .
it &apos;s a very reasonable question .
but the problem is our self @-@ positioning .
the other way to think about it is that people are not lying for crimes , but we are not for them .
I mean , this is very shocking .
death penalty in the United States is always a mistake .
every nine who had a death penalty would have been proven to be <unk> en route .
this type of strike -- a ninth -- is absolutely innocent .
I have to say , it &apos;s amazing .
the <unk> knew that if the plane would have an accident , we would never let the man fly .
but somehow we can ignore the problem of death .
because it &apos;s not our own problem .
it &apos;s not our own problems .
it &apos;s not our own struggle .
I have a lot of questions .
race , and we are not worthy of execution .
it &apos;s alarming . when I teach African history , I talk to students about slavery .
and they were talking about terrorism in the beginning of the Second World War .
we don &apos;t really understand that history .
but for the black people in this country , it was a <unk> time .
in many communities , people were scared of <unk> and <unk> .
people were afraid they were going to be attacked by bombs .
it changed their life .
the man at the time is now old , come and talk to me , &quot; You know , sir , you &apos;ve got to tell you about the first time we &apos;ve ever had terrorism in America . &quot;
they told me , &quot; We are born in fear . &quot;
the era of terrorism , of course , has finally become <unk> : decades of racism and apartheid .
however , our country doesn &apos;t like to talk about existence .
we don &apos;t like to talk about history .
and because of that , we can &apos;t really understand what we &apos;ve done .
we are constantly creating conflict .
it &apos;s making intense atmosphere .
we can &apos;t talk about race because we don &apos;t want to face a series of facts that we don &apos;t want to accomplish .
in South Africa , people know that we can &apos;t forget about apartheid unless we &apos;re honest with it .
in Rwanda , even after the genocide , people were faced , but we were not willing to .
I also talked about the death penalty issue in Germany .
and it turned out to be amazing , because there was an academic standing up there saying , &quot; You know , it &apos;s dreadful . &quot;
she said , &quot; We don &apos;t have a death penalty in Germany .
of course , our Germany will never have a death penalty . &quot;
the whole woman said , &quot; Because our history , we &apos;re never going to decide that systematically is broken .
we have a <unk> , we have a conscience that we can &apos;t get .
I thought about this .
what would it be like to feel like if I watched the Germans all day ?
I couldn &apos;t care .
it wasn &apos;t enough .
but in our country , in the South states , we are indeed killing -- when the victim is white , not black , the likelihood of a death penalty is 10 times more likely to be executed for black men than the white death penalty of you -- the likelihood of being executed -- those are filled with <unk> people everywhere .
but we &apos;re not paying attention .
I believe that we have a defining crisis .
when we &apos;re not interested in these intractable problems , we are still lousy at all about the positive things .
we love innovation .
we love technology , we love to create .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , all of these good things are suffering from suffering , <unk> , human rights , <unk> and <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary for both of us .
because ultimately , we &apos;re talking about how we want to be secure , we want to make a difference to how we live in this complex society .
for me , it took time to spend time thinking about the poor , the vulnerable individuals who never had the opportunity to come to TED .
but they &apos;re thinking about it in a sense that they &apos;re merging into our lives .
you know , at the end , we have to believe things that are not seen .
we have to . as a rational society , smart society .
innovation , building development , not just in our heads .
they &apos;re a product of the wisdom of our brains and our beliefs .
it &apos;s a self @-@ sustaining , and I believe it &apos;s not just for the light , but for the dark and intractable matter .
the Tarahumara , the brilliant leader , talked about it .
he said , &quot; When we solve the problem in Eastern Europe , we want to do a lot of it , but most importantly , we want a chance of a soul towards a sense of despair and the will of the future . &quot;
and the point of the mind is that my core beliefs about the TED society are going to be involved .
there &apos;s nothing to do with deep science and perfect design and human space , as long as we can see it , to reach out to poverty , to power , to power , to power , to <unk> , to power , to <unk> , to power .
and I want to remind you that this is a very challenging place to pay attention .
it will affect you .
when I was a young lawyer , I was very lucky to meet Mrs. Hall .
Mrs. Lois <unk> , who , every time she would meet two friend of mine , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was a bus <unk> -- very black women -- in Virginia , Virginia , a white woman named Martin Luther King .
these women get together and talk about issues .
sometimes the <unk> would call me up and ask me , &quot; Ma &apos;am , we &apos;re gonna get out .
do you want to hear us ? &quot;
I would say , &quot; Of course , ma , I &apos;d like to . &quot;
she said , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
I say , &quot; I want to listen . &quot;
and I &apos;m going to go back , just to listen .
these parties are always very inspiring and inspiring .
one time I was there listening to her lady , she asked me , &quot; Brian , tell me about your equality initiative .
tell me what you &apos;re going to do . &quot;
and I started to <unk> .
I said , &quot; We want to challenge injustice .
we want to help those who have been wrongfully convicted of <unk> .
we want to fight against prejudice and discrimination in international institutions .
to give children a life @-@ saving system to the end .
we want to do something about the death penalty system .
we want to reduce the population .
we also want to keep falling apart . &quot;
I did a five @-@ <unk> presentation , and when I finished , she looked at me and she said , &quot; Happy New Year . &quot;
she said , &quot; These things are going to get you tired , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
and the <unk> came , and she put her hand up to me and she said , &quot; This is why you are so brave . &quot;
and I &apos;m sure that this TED society needs to be a little more wiser .
we need to find our way to confront these problems , these suffering .
because ultimately , our whole humanity depends on the human being .
in my work .
I learned very simple principle .
I began to understand that every single one of us would not be defined by our worst .
I believe that for every man on the planet .
if he had a lie , it would not mean that he was a liar .
if he didn &apos;t belong to anything he didn &apos;t say he was a <unk> .
even if you &apos;re not saying that you &apos;re a killer .
because I believe that humans have a fundamental dignity law must respect it .
I also believe that in many places in our country , of course , even the opposite of poverty in the world is not rich .
I don &apos;t believe this .
I think , in many , many different places , the opposite is justice .
and finally , I believe that although it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s tempting to pitch , but we &apos;re not going to be judged by technology , we &apos;re not going to be judged , we &apos;re not going to be judged by wisdom and philosophy .
and finally , people are saying that our society is not based on how we might be good people , but how we might be punished for the poor , the ones that are being trapped by the poor .
because it &apos;s this dark spot where we &apos;re really beginning to understand how people we are .
I don &apos;t know . I want to end with a story .
I work too much .
it &apos;s like everybody .
sometimes these ideas are too big , and they don &apos;t work very well .
I used to justify these kids with a very heavy <unk> .
I went to Alcatraz , and I saw my <unk> , and they were accused of being adults , as adults .
I started to think , what &apos;s going on ?
how could a judge a single individual be a different person ?
the judge said he was an adult , but I just saw a kid .
and one night , I didn &apos;t think about it , but I was like , &quot; Oh my God , if the judge could write you a different person , the judge must have magic . &quot;
by the way , Brian , the judge has a magic .
you &apos;re free .
because I slept too late , my brain didn &apos;t know that I was going to make a bill .
I had a grad student , I had a black kid .
I started to make his mantra : to get my 14 @-@ year @-@ old black kid into a four @-@ year @-@ old , white guy .
in this case , I said the <unk> , the police department , the court .
it said that there was no justice , no <unk> or anything like that .
the next morning I woke up , and I did a dream , or did I actually write this proposal ?
and the fear is , not only did I send me to the court .
a few months back in time , I forgot about it .
and I decided , &quot; Oh my God , I have to do this . &quot;
I jump in and I feel nervous -- very nervous .
I went to the court .
I &apos;m thinking , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , it &apos;s going to be pain .
I finally got out of the car , and I started to go to court .
when I got on the stairs , there was a black <unk> , the <unk> cleaner .
he saw me running , and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; You , you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; I said , &quot; Yes . sir . &quot;
and the response came to me , and this is what happened to me .
he whispered his ear in my ear .
he said , &quot; I &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
I have to admit to you that this is going to give me a break .
he warned my heart to my heart , and my self was reminded that I was going to make a difference in society , in a better way .
so I ran to the court .
I went in , and I saw the judge , and I said , &quot; Look , I &apos;ll go .
&quot; Mr. Ma &apos;am , did you write this ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , sir . I wrote . &quot; we started to argue .
people came in , because everybody was angry .
I did write quite a few things .
the cop comes in , gets in , gets in .
I &apos;m not going to get back , and the whole court is full of anger , because we &apos;re talking about race , we &apos;re talking about poverty , we &apos;re talking about poverty .
I was walking around the corner of the eye , walking around .
he keeps getting tired , he hears people complaining .
he just kind of raced away .
and finally , this black guy came in , and he was afraid to sit behind me and almost immediately and almost immediately <unk> .
10 minutes later , the judge suggested a rest .
at the end of the day , a vice @-@ <unk> thought was a false mistake .
this is a <unk> jump , and this is a <unk> .
he said , &quot; Jimmy , what do you do for the address ? &quot;
this old black guy stood up and looked at this <unk> , and he said , &quot; I come in and I want to tell this young man to go ahead and see it for a better turn . &quot;
I come to TED today because I believe a lot of people here understand the moral <unk> of the world , but it &apos;s always been sideways , it &apos;s almost undeniable .
before we start caring about human rights and dignity , we can &apos;t really accomplish evolution .
our survival and every one of us are not alone .
we have a vision of technology and design in terms of the vision of entertainment and creativity that has to do with human nature , of philanthropy , of philanthropy .
and most important of all , I just want to show you a little bit about every nut , and I want to see it better .
thank you .
you need to hear the audience , the group who want to help you , and what you want to do .
what can we do with this check ?
Brian : there are many opportunities .
for example , if you live in California this spring , there &apos;s a poll that will be a big <unk> about the <unk> and the money that we &apos;re spending on .
for example , in California , we &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars -- 100 million .
and at the same time , 45 percent of our homicide falls .
fifty percent of all the tarps were gone .
this was an opportunity to change .
this was a poll that was asked to spend it on law enforcement and on security services .
I think we can help .
Chris : there is a big decline in crime in the last 30 years .
some people say partly because of a rising rate of imprisonment .
how would you tell the story ?
Brian : almost nothing changes .
the rate of imprisonment is not violent .
it &apos;s the abuse of drugs .
that &apos;s the main reason why our population is rising .
we &apos;re a little too far on <unk> .
at the same time , we had three and a half dozen rules for fixing some people permanent , just because they stole a bicycle , or a little bit of <unk> , we didn &apos;t give them the opportunity to make a <unk> .
I believe that we need to help people who are committed to crimes , not to deprive them .
and I think that philosophy of today has nothing to do with him .
I think this one should change .
Brian , you &apos;re ready for help .
you &apos;re really excited about this guy .
thank you very much for coming to TED . thank you .
<unk> : after bin Laden was killed , there was a massive increase in fear .
encounter two : Somalia , there are famine . three : police use pepper spray .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> . five : a thick <unk> .
DB : <unk> . <unk> : sixty @-@ five . sixty @-@ five .
<unk> : the tsunami . <unk> 9 : cyberattacks .
number three : drug wars , mass destruction , hurricane , droughts .
it was a recession , and it was the beginning of Egypt , Syria , Syria .
crisis , death , disaster .
Oh my God !
Peter Ward : this is a video that I &apos;ve collected in the last six months , and if it &apos;s six days , or in the last six years , it can be easily collected .
the point is that the media tends to teach us negative information because our brains are very easy to look at .
and of course , the brain has a very important reason .
all the time , our sensors &quot; collect a lot of information about our brains don &apos;t come .
and there is no more important information about survival than about living , and all of the data that goes through is a very primitive part of the brain called the brain .
the <unk> is our early detection , dangerous <unk> .
it divides all the information and check it out , any threat in the environment .
so every time we open the paper , we automatically read all kinds of negative information .
the old one said , &quot; <unk> the headline , &quot; which is very good .
and now we have all kinds of digital instruments , all the time , all the way up to us , and it &apos;s not surprising .
no wonder people think the world is backwards .
but that might be true .
it &apos;s not that , and the message that we get is distorted .
our society has a huge impact on the consequences of a series of events that have happened in the last 30 years , and in fact , that speed allows us to have a high @-@ probability in the next 30 years .
I &apos;m not saying that these problems are not -- climate crises , mass extinctions -- water and energy shortage are indeed occurring .
as humans , we are very good at making all kinds of predictions about the crisis , but we will eventually eliminate them .
let &apos;s look at what happened in the last century to understand what direction we &apos;re going to move forward .
over the last hundred years , human life expectancy has increased two times more , inflation has increased the average income of the world .
the infant mortality rate goes down 10 times .
food , transportation , transportation , communication , communication , cost 10 to 1,000 times less than it is .
Steve Wozniak we are living in the most peaceful era of human history .
and Charles <unk> suggested that the world was going up from 25 to 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a great time .
but a lot of people forget this .
we keep hoping that the more we go .
in fact , we have changed the concept of poverty .
if you think about it , most people in the United States today live in poverty have electricity , drinking water , microphones , telephone calls , air conditioning and cars .
the richest <unk> <unk> in the 20th century , the folks on the planet have never imagined it .
and the basis of all this is technology . and a very recent exponential technology .
my good friend Ray <unk> showed any information technology to follow the curves , which is Moore &apos;s law , and it &apos;s doubling every 12 to 24 months in price performance .
that &apos;s why you have a mobile phone in your pocket that &apos;s about 100 times cheaper than the &apos; 70s , and you have about 1,000 times more .
look at the curve .
this is Moore &apos;s Law from the last hundred years .
I want you to notice two things about the curve .
first of all , it &apos;s very smooth -- whether it &apos;s good or bad , whether it &apos;s war or peace or peace , or recession or growth .
it &apos;s because faster computers are used to make faster computers .
it won &apos;t happen because the big challenges we face cannot slow down .
even though the one on the left is the curve , it &apos;s still the curve .
technology accelerated itself , and pace changed itself .
on this Moore &apos;s Law curve , it &apos;s a series of powerful technologies for everybody .
cloud computing , my friend of mine at Autodesk called an infinite number of computing power , sensors and networks , 3D printing , allowing us to get the power of synthetic and <unk> production around the world : artificial life , the synthetic life , the synthetic life , the new vaccine , the synthetic life , the synthetic food , the synthetic life .
how many of you have seen IBM , when it &apos;s won , when it &apos;s won ?
that was great .
I looked at all the press headlines that I thought was the best .
I like this : &quot; Watson <unk> the human race . &quot;
it &apos;s not an easy game .
the key is to understand the subtle detail in human language .
so you can imagine the kind of artificial intelligence that &apos;s in this kind of computational computation that all of the people who have actions can be used .
four years ago at TED , Ray <unk> and I started a new university called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
we teach students all sorts of technologies and especially how to use these technologies to address the grand challenge of human beings .
every single year , we &apos;ve asked students to build a product or make a service that will make a positive impact on a billion people &apos;s lives in 10 years .
imagine a group of students could impact a billion people &apos;s lives today .
it sounds ridiculous , 30 years ago .
today we can list the companies that make it happen .
when I think about creating a rich society , it &apos;s not about creating a luxury for every single person on the planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
it &apos;s the resource that &apos;s poor and poor .
technology is relative , and technology is a source of resources .
let me give you an example .
this is a story of Napoleon &apos;s land in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the one on the left .
I invited all the kids to go to dinner .
all the soldiers were using gold @-@ <unk> , and Napoleon himself was using gold plates .
but the king of Thailand uses aluminum <unk> .
aluminum used to be the most skilled metals in the world , much more expensive than gold and <unk> .
that &apos;s why <unk> is made of aluminum .
even though the aluminum foil is the <unk> of the earth , it &apos;s not the green metal form .
it &apos;s all about oxygen and oxygen and oxygen .
but then there was the <unk> technology that made the shipping price so low that we could see it at one time .
let &apos;s apply this metaphor to other things .
let &apos;s think about energy shortage .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s equivalent to the total energy consumption we have in the year .
every 88 minutes has 16 megawatts of energy on the Earth &apos;s surface .
the problem is not scarce resource , it &apos;s accessible .
there are good news .
this is the first year in India , where solar power can be reduced to half the cost of fossil fuels -- <unk> <unk> , 17 rupees .
the cost of solar power last year has halved .
last month , MIT announced a study which showed that by 2020 , the cost of solar power is between six and six cents per kilowatt @-@ hour , which is 15 cents .
if we have enough energy , we have rich clean water .
let &apos;s put in the water .
remember ? 1990 , the <unk> , the <unk> , was going through Saturn &apos;s spaceship , face the Earth .
take a famous picture , what is the name ?
&quot; dot @-@ com . &quot;
because we live on a planet .
the Earth is covered with water .
yes , the <unk> percent is two percent of sea water , and we &apos;re fighting over 1.5 and a half percent of the world &apos;s water , but we still have hope .
there &apos;s a technology that &apos;s being prepared for it , not the next 10 years , which is now .
there &apos;s a nano technology .
I spoke to a great DIY man this morning , Dean Kamen , and I &apos;d like to share with you -- and I &apos;ve been able to convince him -- to develop a technology called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and some of you may have heard about it as a small fridge .
you can go from any water every day -- seawater , pollution , water , <unk> -- to make 1,000 liter of clean drinking water , each one of those liter costs less than two cents a day .
the president of Coca @-@ Cola has been tested in over many developing countries called <unk> .
if it &apos;s successful , I &apos;m confident that it will be successful , that Coke &apos;s around the world will be able to deploy the device around the world .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s already being driven by technology .
we see this on the mobile phone .
my days , at the end of 2013 , the mobile phone in the developing world will reach 70 percent .
think about it . in the center of Kenyan troops owned a better move than a 25 years ago .
if they visit Google , they get more knowledge and information about 15 years ago than President Clinton .
they live in a world of information and abundance that nobody could have predicted .
and better yet , we spend tens of millions of dollars -- GPS , television and <unk> , and medical diagnostic technology -- not <unk> in your phone .
the best part of this is probably health .
and last month , I was honored to be announcing with the <unk> <unk> , which is 1,000 million dollars .
we challenge the team around the world to bring these technologies together into mobile devices , and you can speak to it , because it has an artificial intelligence , or a <unk> to it .
to win the competition , the device needs to provide you better diagnosis for a group of directors .
imagine this application with a shortage of physicians , 25 percent of the disease burden to just 1.3 percent of the developing countries .
if this device lasts for the microRNA or DNA , it can &apos;t recognize that the first time it &apos;s going to call a disease to prevent a pandemic .
there is also the power of rich and rich world .
I call it the &quot; top billion . &quot;
that white line is the population .
the population of the Earth is over 70 billion .
and by the way , the best way to prevent the explosion of population is to get more education in the world .
in 2010 , we have nearly two billion people connected to the Internet .
by 2020 , the Internet will go from two billion to five billion .
thirty billion people have never been touched by this conversation .
what do they want ?
what would they consume ? what would their wish be ?
we &apos;re going to have the largest economy in it , not the recession .
these people represent hundreds of millions of dollars of <unk> that will be put into a global economy .
they &apos;re going to be better , because using the device , and they &apos;re going to use the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be better at seeing the Khan of the Khan Academy of 3D printing and infinity , and it becomes more productive than ever .
what are the three billion healthy , educated , productive human social members for us ?
a series of discoveries we &apos;ve never touched .
it &apos;s also about giving , or other difficult people to get their attention and help .
what does that lead to ?
maybe it &apos;s something that we haven &apos;t seen yet ?
and one of the things that I &apos;ve learned in terms of the winning X meet is that the goal is clear , the passionate team can achieve excellence in the past , and in the past , the large corporations and government .
let me end up with a story , which is very exciting .
some of you may have heard of this project .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it comes from Washington in Seattle .
it &apos;s a sequence that allows individuals to get a amino acids and figure out how the proteins are folded .
the way it &apos;s folding is the structure and function of the amino acids .
it &apos;s a very important medical study .
until now , this is still a problem done by super @-@ computer .
this is a game that they play with .
and then hundreds of people play the game .
it also shows that human pattern detection is still better than the best computer .
when you synthesize the best folding experts , it &apos;s not a professor at MIT , it &apos;s not a student from <unk> , it &apos;s an English woman from the Manchester Craftsmen &apos;s Guild , which is the best protein in the world .
and ladies and gentlemen , what gave me faith in the future is that every single one of us , as individuals , has been challenged around the world .
we have fast @-@ evolving technology and tools .
it &apos;s also a passion for DIY inventors .
you all have the power to be a technology <unk> .
and there are 30 million people on the line who are working with us to get the big challenge , to do what we need to do .
we &apos;re going to be mastery of decades .
thank you .
I think that in modern medicine , there is a cultural need to start changing .
and this change can start with a doctor , which is me .
maybe it &apos;s because I &apos;ve been in medicine for years , I can give up some money to start this .
so before we enter the theme , let &apos;s talk about baseball .
why not ?
the traditional baseball game is over , and the professional baseball is going to start .
we all love baseball , right ?
there are hundreds of thousands of deaf people in baseball .
let &apos;s take the data .
the movie &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is about statistic and how to build a great team based on the data .
I want to talk about a data that I want you all heard about .
it &apos;s called a hit rate .
when we say a ball hits , it <unk> .
we mean that the player &apos;s hit very stable , and every 10 times you have three <unk> .
it means that the <unk> are hit and gets caught in the <unk> , and doesn &apos;t get killed immediately , and the ball isn &apos;t going to be successful until the <unk> is hit .
ten are three .
do you know how a baseball <unk> has a lot of <unk> ?
great , great , great singer players .
you know , how they called a ball , they have 40 percent .
is it the four <unk> player in every 10 times ?
it &apos;s a legacy of -- like Ted Williams -- he &apos;s a baseball <unk> -- and he &apos;s the last baseball player in baseball -- has more than four million hits .
now let &apos;s go back to my world -- medical field , which I &apos;m familiar with , but I &apos;m going to have a little bit of a problem .
if you have a <unk> , and then you get an account of a surgeon in an eight @-@ year @-@ old brain , 40 percent of the bat &apos;s .
it sounds strange , right ?
and if you live in a very remote area , and the two vessels that you love have been blocked , your <unk> <unk> account for a central cardiac surgeon who appears to have a &quot; <unk> in a blood vessel . &quot;
but wait , wait , you know what ?
she has a big increase in the expression of this year , and her level is healing .
her &quot; hit &quot; hit hit &quot; hit 5 .
but it can &apos;t be accepted .
and I want to ask you a question .
you think , what a medical doctor should be like , or a professional , or a professional manager , is a surgeon , &quot; or &quot; How should it be ? &quot;
<unk> ? very good .
in fact , nobody in medical medicine knows how much a good surgeon or an emergency person should have .
we take them , we include myself , we send them a career , we tell them to be perfect .
absolute , absolutely impossible to make false diagnosis -- but we asked them to think about detail , how do we get there ?
that &apos;s what I got at medical school .
I &apos;m a student with an evolutionary tendency .
at school , a student once said , Brian <unk> is going to review the blood test .
and I did .
I was in a very short distance from this little kid in Toronto , and I finished my studies .
I had everything .
I &apos;ve just spoken about every piece of the <unk> and the way that the muscles stretch , the way they stretch out , each branch of the aorta , and all the <unk> , or the usual suspects .
I even know how to judge different <unk> .
and during that time , I accumulate more and more knowledge .
I did well , and I graduated with the grade .
when I came out of medical school , I thought I could just get everything I knew -- or I was going to do everything -- almost everything that I &apos;d made was going to have a medical situation .
and I did not get wrong in a while , until I met <unk> women .
when Ms. <unk> was brought into a teaching hospital in Toronto , I was working as a place to work .
I had a cardiac cardiac cardiac cardiac cardiac cardiac catheterization .
my job is , when the emergency patient needs to have a full @-@ spectrum of cardiac patients , they &apos;re going to be in the ICU .
and I was in charge of my return .
when I saw <unk> , her breath was very faint .
I heard her breath when I spoke to her .
when I was listening to her to her chest , it told me that there was a ferocious sound coming out of the sides that came to me that was a <unk> heart failure .
and this is due to heart failure , to get all the blood from the heart to the lungs , and it causes the blood to come back into the lungs , and it &apos;s filled with blood and bone .
it &apos;s not a difficult diagnostic .
and I started to help her .
I gave her the toaster aspirin , and gave her something that would help reduce her heart .
I gave her some <unk> , <unk> , to help her take the extra water in her body .
and over the next couple of hours , she began to feel better .
I was happy .
and at this point I made the first mistake : I made her home .
at the right , I made two errors .
I had been back home before my bed with my family .
I didn &apos;t do what I was supposed to do , and I got the phone call to call my <unk> and showed him the opportunity to meet him .
my <unk> knew her , so I could give her more detailed data .
maybe I have a reason for that .
maybe I don &apos;t want to do the kind of thing that &apos;s always required .
maybe the swami is right , and you don &apos;t have to interact with my <unk> , which is good for his patient .
the second mistake I made was even more serious .
when I got her home , I ignored a small voice in my heart , and the voice was trying to tell me , &quot; Don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , I was so innocent that I could even ask the nurses for caring for the woman , &quot; Would you like her to go home ? &quot;
the nurse thought , and he said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t think there &apos;s a problem . &quot;
this all seemed to me yesterday .
I signed up at the hospital , and an ambulance woman sent her home .
and I went back to my work in clinic .
on the next day , my gut feeling a cold gut feeling .
but I still work .
and at the end of the day , I set out to leave the hospital , and I went to a parking lot to get my car , and I did something that I would never do .
I borrowed the term from the emergency room .
and there was another nurse there , not the woman who had taken care of <unk> , who said to me that most physicians were scared of three words .
other naive physicians are also afraid of these three words , but because physicians look at patients , these three words are very specific to us .
these three words : remember ?
&quot; remember ? the patient you send home ? &quot;
the nurse asked .
&quot; she &apos;s coming back . &quot; and she &apos;s using that normal tone .
she did come back .
it &apos;s been endangered .
and after I got her home about an hour after that , she was on the floor , her family hit 9 / 11 , an emergency woman brought her back to an emergency room , and at this point she had severe shock , blood pressure was 50 percent .
her breath is very <unk> , and it &apos;s very thin .
the crowd was shocked .
they gave her increased blood pressure .
and she connected her <unk> .
and I was amazed , and it was pretty scary .
and I was feeling like I was doing a <unk> , because when they shove her down her stability , she delivered her to a operating room , and I wanted her to wake up in despair .
but in the next two or three days , she would never wake up again .
her brain had been <unk> to heal .
her family came together .
and in the course of the following year , they slowly accepted it .
at the end of the year , they chose to leave her life -- the <unk> , the wife , the mother , the grandmother .
some people say you &apos;re never going to forget the names of the people you &apos;re going to die for .
and that was the first time I realized that .
for the next couple of weeks , I was so frustrated , and I had the first time in that kind of fear that there was in medical culture -- I felt alone . it was not a feeling of being healthy , because you couldn &apos;t talk about it .
it &apos;s that , when you have a choice of a friend , you have a choice to tell the secret of a compass , and you know , your best friend shall look for you , but that last guilt will still lead you , and I will never tell you that way .
and then you do the right @-@ hand commitment , and then you &apos;re never going to take a <unk> .
it &apos;s a stigma .
and the kind of non @-@ toxic shame that I &apos;m talking about will allow you to lose your head .
it would say to you , not what you do , but you are bad people .
that was my feeling .
and that &apos;s not because of my <unk> ; other people are very good .
he talked to his family . I was sure that I had not been arrested for making sure I had not been punched up to me .
but I kept asking myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t I touch my <unk> ? why did I get her home ?
and I was frustrated , and I said , why do I make such a stupid mistake ?
why would I choose to enter medical medicine ?
slowly , but steady , awful feeling began to dilute .
and I began to feel a little <unk> .
and then in a sunny day , when I saw a flash of sun , I thought , maybe I could feel good again .
and I did an appointment with myself : if I could make perfect , I could never make mistakes , please let that go .
that voice did stop .
I went back to work .
but it happened .
two years later , when I was in a neighborhood in Toronto , I looked at a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man who was 25 years old .
the clinic was busy , so I was a little slow .
he &apos;s always pointing up here .
I looked at it , and his throat was kind of exhilarating .
I left him with a prescription for penicillin .
even when he got out of the hall , he seemed to be pointing at his throat .
two days later , I was at the emergency room , and my director was going to go to her office and talk about it in private .
she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; remember ? who did you see the throat ? &quot;
he didn &apos;t have to have a <unk> .
it &apos;s a condition that might be threatened to live , called <unk> .
you can search on Google , but it &apos;s not throat , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s potentially respiratory failure .
he didn &apos;t die .
and a few days after he was put up antibiotics , he was cured .
and I went back to that stigma , and I got emotional response , and I got back to work until these errors happened again .
at the same pace , I didn &apos;t find the patient twice .
it &apos;s very hard to imagine what &apos;s going to happen , especially when you &apos;re in a hospital where you work at night .
although for those two cases , I didn &apos;t get them home , and I didn &apos;t think there was any void and errors in care .
one of the things I found was he had a <unk> .
he set up the kidney , but it turned out to be normal , and my colleague was working on the patient &apos;s condition , and he noticed that there was some soft place on the right , left @-@ hand side , and he connected the surgeon .
another patient has severe diarrhea .
I gave him some liquid to help him replace the water , and looked at my colleague .
<unk> did . when he noticed that the patient is a little soft , soft , association surgeons .
both of these patients have done surgery and recovered .
but when I think about those two cases , that feeling <unk> me .
and I hope I can tell you that the worst mistake that I &apos;ve made is only five years ago when I started practicing , like so many of my colleagues , what I call normal , but it &apos;s a complete <unk> .
I &apos;ve made some mistakes in the last five years .
I still feel lonely , shame .
but the crux of the problem is : if I can &apos;t get the answer to the wrong mistakes I &apos;ve made , if I can &apos;t find the voice that will tell me the wrong source , how can I share my experience with my colleague ?
how can I teach them not to repeat my mistakes ?
when I walk into a situation -- like now , I don &apos;t know how you see me .
when do you hear someone talking about their own failure once again ?
yes , if you go to a party , you might hear some mistakes about other doctors , but you don &apos;t hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
if I walked into a room right now , my colleague , asking them to help and start telling them what I told you about , maybe before I even tell you more than two stories , they &apos;re going to start feeling very uneasy . somebody will change the topic .
in fact , if I , or my colleague , I know that one of the guys in the hospital had been touched by the patient , and I believed that when I met him , I could never meet him .
that &apos;s what we have .
a completely false system .
there are only two people in this system -- they &apos;re wrong , they can avoid sleep , sleep loss of sleep and bad outcomes .
it &apos;s almost like the immune response to the immune system , like the antibodies , starts to attack the very different people .
we have an idea that when we apply all the wrong people in medicine , we get a safe system .
but that idea can produce two problems .
in my first medical broadcast and news work , from the first article that I wrote in Toronto to my show &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; where I &apos;ve been studying everything I can access to medical mistakes I can access to .
and what I learned was that it was absolutely everywhere .
we &apos;re working in a system that &apos;s going to happen every day , and a 10 percent chance of a hospital is going to give the wrong dose , or give the wrong dose , and in a hospital , it &apos;s going to be increasingly increasingly infected , with unnecessary harm and death .
in this country , nearly 20,000 <unk> died of medical mistakes .
in the United States , according to the Institute of Medicine , this is about 10 million people .
even though , both of these together have still underestimated the reality , because we have never looked at this problem before .
the point is that .
in a healthcare system , in two or three years of the year , we can &apos;t get the growth of knowledge .
sleep deprivation is very widespread .
and we can &apos;t get rid of that .
we have our own intuition biases that will directly affect our conclusion , for example , a patient that I can record perfectly well @-@ documented .
but if the same patient with the same <unk> , then with a little bit of alcohol , I wrote a little bit of <unk> , which was a bit of <unk> .
and this is a very different one .
I &apos;m not a robot , I won &apos;t do the same thing every time .
my patient is not a car , they &apos;re not going to describe their symptoms every single time .
so it &apos;s inevitable .
if the Eameses had been taught to prove that all the easy medical professionals to go awry , then there would be no left in this field .
and it &apos;s about people who don &apos;t want to talk about the worst false mistakes that they can &apos;t talk about .
in my show , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which is my worst mistake , &quot; which is the worst mistake I can say to everyone who &apos;s going to have a heart attack and have a heart attack , &quot; which says , &quot; This is my worst mistake , and I &apos;m going to pass the microphone . &quot;
now , their pupils dilate , they go to the ground , they look at the mouth , they start to tell me their story .
they want to say their stories , they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; Listen , <unk> and me . &quot;
they &apos;re just going to be in a situation .
what they need is a re @-@ defined medical culture .
start with one individual doctor .
doctors who were once more define themselves as humans , understanding that she was man , and she was not impressed , but she could learn from it and learn from others .
she &apos;s going to share her experience with other people .
and it &apos;s for people to talk about their own failure .
she &apos;s not going to have a healthy mindset , but only a way to get everybody from the table to the point where they &apos;re going to be wrong .
and the medical culture that she worked on was recognizing that the system was operating , and when someone was operating on a system , it was often a failure .
so the system can evolve over and over and over again , and it can make it easier for people to avoid mistakes , and at the same time , we can produce a caring environment and encourage every one of us to look at our health care system to point out the potential mistakes that might be encouraging people to be wrong , when we &apos;re wrong .
I &apos;m Brian <unk> .
I was a physician who was <unk> .
I &apos;m a human , and I get wrong .
I &apos;m sorry for that , but I &apos;m going to try and learn how to do this .
I still don &apos;t know how you see me , but I think I can .
and I ended up making three words for myself : I remember .
in the 1980s , in communism , if you have a typewriter , you have to go to the government .
you have to come up with a copy of the typewriter .
in this case , the government can follow where the text came from .
if they find a page writing the wrong view , they can track who &apos;s produced that view .
and in the West , we can &apos;t understand how someone can do this , how much freedom of speech can be done .
we will never do that in our own country .
but today , in 2011 , if you bought a page from any large <unk> manufacturer to print a page , a page to paper , and then a piece of paper would ultimately have a small percentage of pages on every page that would allow you and your printer .
this is what happens to us today .
it doesn &apos;t seem like nobody was doing it .
it &apos;s an example of how our government uses technology to deal with our citizens .
this is one of the three sources of the Internet .
if we look at what happens in the online world , we identify what the attacker is .
we have three major groups .
we have online criminals .
here we have a gentleman named Ellen <unk> from Kiev , Ukraine .
online criminals are easily understandable .
these guys are trying to make money .
they make a lot of money online attacks , lots of money .
we actually have several cases where they &apos;re all <unk> , <unk> , all made by attack online .
there &apos;s also <unk> from Estonia .
this is Alfred <unk> .
this is Stephen Hawking .
this is <unk> <unk> .
this is Matthew Anderson , a brass pen , etc . , etc .
these people are making a lot of money online , but they &apos;re making illegal money by using bank assets like <unk> from our accounts , when we &apos;re putting our money online , or using <unk> to gather our credit card information when we &apos;re bought into a computer that &apos;s available online .
the United States , two months ago , frozen <unk> in the bank accounts of Mr. <unk> &apos;s bank , and that frozen bank account had <unk> million dollars .
Mr. <unk> &apos;s still not working ; nobody knows where he is .
today I have argued that any of us have the potential to be a victim of online crime and beyond reality .
and obviously it &apos;s getting worse .
in the future , most crime will happen online .
the second group of attacks that we &apos;re looking at today are not due to money .
their motivation came from the other side -- the protests , the <unk> , for the laugh .
these anonymous groups have been active in the last 12 months , and they &apos;ve become the primary participants in online attacks .
these are the three main military attacks : for the money , anonymous predators , for the last group of ethnic nations , government attacks .
let &apos;s look at an example of what happened to a company called <unk> .
this is a typical example of government attacking its people .
<unk> is an authority in the Netherlands , or it used to be .
it was broken last fall because they were invasion .
some people have completely destroyed it .
I spoke to a meeting last week at the time of the New York Times , and I asked a leader if he could find somebody who was dying of the attack .
his answer was yes .
so how do people die from such a attack ?
<unk> is an authority board .
they sell the license .
what do you do with a certificate ?
you need a certificate , which is that you have a website that has <unk> encryption , web encryption service , which kind of healthcare .
now all of us , or most of us , use Wang <unk> or any of its opposition , and these services are particularly popular in the <unk> state of Iran , Iran @-@ state @-@ owned services , because they know that these are more reliable connections than local services , that they can &apos;t discuss with them .
they can also , if they attack a foreign authority .
<unk> .
and that &apos;s what happened in the United States .
what happens to the Arab uprisings like in Egypt ?
in Egypt , the riots had broken the base of Egypt , which was in April of 2011 , they found a lot of documents .
in these documents there was a <unk> called <unk> .
some notes come from a German company , and they sell a set of tools for the Egyptian government -- big proportions , all the communication in the public .
they &apos;re selling this tool for 28 million Euros in Egypt .
the headquarters for the company are there .
so , the West provides the power of government the authorities against their citizens .
but the Western government did do that for themselves .
for example , in Germany , it was discovered a few weeks ago called <unk> , and the German government was used to investigate their people .
if you &apos;re a alert to the attacks , it &apos;s obvious that your <unk> are being watched .
but today , things are beyond .
they &apos;re going to watch your Internet connection .
they &apos;re going to use this kind of <unk> device to infect your computer so that they can watch all your communication , listen to your online discussion , gather your password .
when we think about these things a little bit deeper , the reaction is , &quot; Yeah , it sounds bad , but because I &apos;m a legitimate citizen , I don &apos;t really have a impact on me .
why am I worried ?
I don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
that &apos;s where the argument is , it &apos;s not good .
privacy is an authentic assessment .
privacy doesn &apos;t have to talk .
it &apos;s not a question of privacy against safety .
it &apos;s a freedom against control .
we are going to trust our government in 2011 , and any power we give up will never lose .
are we going to trust the future government , blindly trusting , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old government ?
these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
it sounds a bit odd , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
the first one was built in <unk> , which was a very simple idea : to embed the tiles of concrete into a composition .
soon it became the largest building in the world .
it allows us to make more fuel , to build bridges , to bridge the gap .
the building was essentially our time @-@ lapse .
and about 100 years later , in &apos; 47 , it brought this .
it was called an autonomous building .
and in just a few years , the Lego blocks took every household .
it &apos;s been estimated that the Lego blocks have made more than four billion dollars -- or 75 dollars per capita .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer , you can build beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
the Lego is possible .
essentially , the Lego blocks , the actual construction of the real world , are used to build the building blocks that we think .
in the same year , in New York City , a new revolution is going to launch , the next generation building blocks .
a transistor is a small plastic component that will take us from a static building , into a world where everything can play .
like the <unk> , you can use a transistor where a transistor is a smaller , more complicated circuit .
but there is a major difference : just experts playing with a transistor .
I personally cannot accept the only experts in our time , so I decided to change it .
eight years ago , when I was at the Media Lab , I began to think about how we could empower engineers and designers .
I started to develop <unk> .
I &apos;ll show you how it works .
the <unk> is a subset of the modules that have a specific function .
they all set in pre @-@ designed , as light , or sensors .
and the best thing is that they &apos;re using magnets , and they &apos;re stuck together .
so it &apos;s not possible to assemble the wrong thing .
these pieces are colored .
green is the output , blue is the input , and the pink is the <unk> .
so what you need to do is you take the blue , you get the green , and then you can start building larger circuits .
you take the blue , you make a green light .
you can put a dial in the middle and you can make a little <unk> .
you remove a pulse of pulses , a pulse here , and now you create a little <unk> .
you add the pressure to the point where you create a noise machine .
I have to get there .
in addition to simplicity , in fact , the functional function is powerful .
it doesn &apos;t require programming , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , it can program you with simple intuition .
so for example , if you shine a little , or if you just spin the dials , you can actually make it faster or slower .
the idea behind the scenes is that this is a material that &apos;s grown .
we want to take every single individual interaction in the world and make a usable building .
the sound , the solar panels , the motors -- everything should be <unk> .
we used to teach our kids to watch them play .
it was an incredible experience .
and the best thing is that they start to understand the appliance that they don &apos;t learn .
for example , how <unk> works , or why the <unk> can keep driving , or how the iPod feels .
we used to bring design schools .
so for example , we used to make designers completely free to start doing things with <unk> .
as you can see , the <unk> and the glass <unk> ...
a few weeks ago , we took <unk> to Rhode Island School of Design to get it to a design institute that has no engineering experience just to cardboard , wood and paper -- to say , &quot; Do something . &quot;
and this is a project that they did , a movement @-@ driven <unk> .
and so on , this is actually one of my favorite projects .
it &apos;s a shrimp play , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
for these technicians , <unk> has become another material , electronic is just a material .
and we want to make this material available for everybody .
so open @-@ source .
you can go to the website and download all the design files for yourself .
we want to encourage a world where everybody is the makers , the inventors , the understanding of the world that we live in , the world that we interact with , the world that we all share .
don &apos;t get it wrong , start your invention .
thank you .
I was 11 years old , and I remember one morning I woke up and I heard a happy sound at home .
my father was using his little gray radio to the BBC .
he couldn &apos;t see it , because most of the news had only killed him .
&quot; the Taliban are gone ! &quot; the father is calling .
I don &apos;t know what that means , but I can see my father is very happy .
&quot; you can now go to a real school , &quot; he said .
I &apos;ll never forget that morning .
a real school .
I was six years old , the Taliban took Afghanistan and decided that girls were illegal .
so , five years after that , I sat with my sister to a secret school where my sister had never been allowed to go .
this is the only education we had .
we &apos;re going to walk different routes every day so that nobody can doubt where we are .
we put the book on the food chain so people think we &apos;re just going to go shopping .
school is in a house , and we &apos;re 100 people in a small living room .
it was good in the winter , but it didn &apos;t work .
we all know that we are not alone in life -- teachers , students and parents are very aware of it .
sometimes , school is closed for a week because the Taliban doubt .
we are always afraid to be found by the Taliban .
are we being tracked ?
do they know where our houses are ?
we &apos;re scared , but we still want to go to school .
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that valued my daughter .
my grandfather was a remarkable man in his day .
he was born in Afghanistan , he had a different view of other people , and he insisted that he could keep his daughter , my mother , to go to school , and that was forced to shut up with his dad .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
that &apos;s her .
she retired two years ago , and she turned my home into a school , a girl and woman in her community .
my dad -- that was he -- he was the first person in his family .
so , of course , his kids should be taught , including his daughters , but they have the Taliban , and they have a risk .
for him , kids don &apos;t accept education is a big risk .
in the Taliban controlled Afghanistan for the years , I remember that sometimes I &apos;d be frustrated about my life forever , seeing the future .
I thought I &apos;d give up , but my father would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you may lose anything in your life .
your money might be stole , and you might be <unk> for the war .
and the only thing that you can live on here is that if we have to pay the tuition to pay your school fees , we &apos;re going to go .
do you even want to keep going ? &quot;
I &apos;m 22 years old now .
I grew up with a few decades of wars .
I &apos;m a woman of age , I don &apos;t have six percent high school , and I &apos;m going to be like most people .
I &apos;m now a proud college student .
it was one of the top <unk> School of America , <unk> County , 2012 in all America , when I went back to Afghanistan , my daughter , son @-@ in @-@ law , first to <unk> my house .
he was proud of not only my university , but also because in women , I was the first , and in women , I was the first to drive him to the street in Kabul .
my family was very confident to me .
my dream is big , but they &apos;re more expecting me .
and that &apos;s why I became a global ambassador , which was a global organization for women &apos;s education .
that &apos;s why I got involved in creating a new role , which is the first , probably the only <unk> in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , girls are still very dangerous .
and what was exciting to me was that I saw students in my school were able to get their chances , their aspirations .
I see their parents , especially their fathers , supporting them like my father , even though they see fear in their face .
for example , he &apos;s not a real , and I can &apos;t show you his face , and he &apos;s my father .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter caught up on the road to his village , and they were blown up by the side of the road .
he goes home , and the phone rings , and a voice tells him that if he sends his daughter to school , it will happen again .
&quot; if you think , it &apos;s going to kill me now . &quot; he said , &quot; but I &apos;m not going to destroy my daughter &apos;s future for you . &quot;
and for Afghanistan , I realized -- this is something that the West has never realized -- that behind our success , it &apos;s a father -- he can recognize his daughter , his daughter &apos;s success , his own success .
it &apos;s not that mothers are not important for our success .
in fact , for the future of daughter &apos;s future , they &apos;re usually the beginning with the most persuasive <unk> , but in society like Afghanistan , we have to have male support .
in the Taliban controlled , the girl who went to school was once a couple of hundred -- don &apos;t forget , it was illegal .
but today , Afghanistan is over 300 million girls .
Afghanistan is very different .
I found that Americans can see the fragility of our change .
and I was worried how long these variations can be kept after U.S. military power .
but when I went back to Afghanistan and saw my students and my support and encourage their parents , I saw the hope that the future will continue .
for me , Afghanistan is full of hope and infinite possibilities , and every day girls reading me that reminded me .
like me , they have great dreams .
thank you .
everything that I did , whether it was my whole life -- was deeply influenced by the youngest seven years of working in Africa .
from 1971 , I look young , but I was actually old in Zambia -- I was in Zambia , Kenya , Cuba , Algeria , and dozens of partnerships with technology in Africa .
I worked in a non @-@ governmental organization , and every project that we built in Africa failed .
I &apos;m all <unk> .
when I was 21 years old , I thought we were Italian , we were doing good for Africa .
however , what are we doing ?
our first project gave me the first book , which is called &quot; <unk> ripple , &quot; and in this case , the Italians decided to teach <unk> food .
so we took the seeds from Italy to the southern tip of a magnificent valley to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the <unk> , to the <unk> , to plant tomatoes and <unk> and so on .
of course , the locals say nothing about it , so we pay the salary , and they &apos;re not going to come for a moment .
we had such a wealthy valley , and the people didn &apos;t grow , and we were amazed .
but we didn &apos;t ask them why , and just the <unk> said , &quot; Let &apos;s get there . &quot;
&quot; help out of starvation at the front lines . &quot;
of course , everything in Africa looks good .
we &apos;re beautiful tomatoes . it &apos;s so big in Italy , a tomatoes , that &apos;s how big it is in Zambia , so big .
it &apos;s unbelievable . we said to the <unk> , &quot; Look , how easy it is . &quot;
when the tomatoes are <unk> , the <unk> is perfectly fine , overnight , the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> all the tomatoes .
we said to the <unk> , &quot; My gosh , these damn <unk> ! &quot;
and the Zambia said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we are not here . &quot;
&quot; why don &apos;t you say anything ? &quot; you haven &apos;t asked . &quot;
I thought that it was only our devotion to Africa , but when I knew what Americans were doing , what the French were doing , I was very proud of our work in Zambia .
because , at least , we feed the <unk> .
you should look at the trash -- you should look at how many of the trash we &apos;re stuck in Africa .
you can read the book , &quot; fatal aid , &quot; written by Dan <unk> , an maternal economist .
this book was published in 2009 .
we &apos;ve been spending two billion dollars on the continent for the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you about the damage that this money has made .
you read it yourself .
look at the view of a woman in Africa , how much of the damage we have made .
we are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and religious missionaries , there are two ways that we deal with people : one is the <unk> .
these two words come from a Latin word , &quot; meaning &quot; father . &quot;
but two words mean different .
parents love to say that I treat different cultures as my children . &quot;
and what sharps means is my servant .
that &apos;s why white Africans are called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is the boss .
when I was in a book , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is &quot; <unk> , &quot; and the author is &quot; <unk> , &quot; and he said that the most important thing about economic development is that if people don &apos;t want to help other people , follow them .
it should be the number one rule of aid .
the primary rule of aid is respect .
this morning , Mr. <unk> , put a stick on the ground and said , &quot; Can we -- can you imagine a city that &apos;s not occupied ? &quot;
when I was 27 years old , I made a decision that was based on the need for people , and I created a work system called &quot; <unk> . &quot; we don &apos;t do the founders , we don &apos;t motivate anybody , but we &apos;re serving for local entrepreneurial services , and we find better places for people .
so what we &apos;re going to do -- shut up .
we go into a community and we don &apos;t apply any ideas to each other , but we sit with the locals .
our work is not at the office .
we met our clients at a restaurant and a pub .
we don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
what we do is we make friends with them , and we discover their interest and purpose .
the most important is passion .
you can ask your ideas .
but what if you &apos;re not interested in each other ?
the passion for self @-@ improvement is the most important .
the passion for the other is to build on the basis of self @-@ improvement , which is the most important .
and we help them to collect the information and the information because it &apos;s in the world , it &apos;s not good enough .
people with ideas don &apos;t necessarily know anything about it , but we can support it .
so a couple of years ago , I had an idea that we couldn &apos;t do at least one of the ideas that we thought was going to impose on them , but it can &apos;t be done in community meetings .
I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
there is a problem with community meetings .
the entrepreneurs never come and they &apos;re not going to tell you where they &apos;re going to spend , where they &apos;re going to spend their money and what they &apos;re going to spend .
so there was a plan for it .
you don &apos;t even have the smartest person in your community because they &apos;re not participating in public meetings .
what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re taking one @-@ on @-@ one , and we &apos;re going to have to build a unprecedented social infrastructure .
we have to make a new career .
it &apos;s the equivalent of the corporate <unk> , the company <unk> , face @-@ to @-@ face with you in your home , your kitchen table , or coffee houses , to help you out the window to transform your entrepreneurial passion into a living skill .
I did a trial in the <unk> state of Michoacan .
I was in a Ph.D. , and I tried to get rid of that , and then I was only <unk> .
my first year at <unk> <unk> , just to go out for a walk , and in those days , I had the first customer , and I helped this first person . he was a <unk> , working in a garage , and I taught him to sell the <unk> , and the fishermen are going to come and say , &quot; Can you help me . &quot;
I asked these five fishermen to operate , not to sell the sweet tuna at 60 cents per square inch , to sell the <unk> in the United States , but to sell a 15 @-@ dollar high to Japan , and then the farmer ran to me and said , &quot; Hey , can you help them ? &quot;
within a year , I did 27 projects , and the government ran to me and said , &quot; What do you do ?
how can you -- &quot; I said , &quot; I did something very difficult .
that &apos;s <unk> , listen to them . &quot;
so -- -- -- so the government said , &quot; Well , then do it . &quot;
we started this project around 300 communities around the world .
we have helped build 40,000 companies .
new entrepreneurs are doing nothing for nothing .
Peter Ward , the greatest manager of all time , died a few years ago , was 96 years old .
Peter Singer at the front of a business professor , Peter Gabriel said , &quot; The plan is incompatible with business @-@ making and business @-@ making . &quot;
the plan was to help the entrepreneurship .
now , we &apos;re rebuilding the <unk> , but not knowing how many of the smartest people are going to use their money and their energy .
we have to learn how to give these people their views .
we have to give them permission , and respect their privacy , and we need to be good at providing them so that they don &apos;t let the room go .
in a community of 100,000 people , we have 200 of them .
can you imagine a community of over 400 people , how much intelligence and passion ?
who &apos;s the most popular talk ?
it &apos;s a very passionate place . you clap them .
so what I &apos;d like to say is that pioneering spirit is what it is today .
when we were at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we were using <unk> fuel , manufacturing -- but we suddenly realized that it was unsustainable .
the internal combustion engine has always been used .
it &apos;s not a green dish .
what we &apos;re going to care about now is how we can meet the food , health , education , transportation , communication and communication .
we can &apos;t do that at all .
who could invent this technology to do the green revolution ? university ?
the government ? don &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s the entrepreneurs , it &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
many years ago , I saw an interesting article in a journal called <unk> .
in 1860 , there were a group of experts invited to talk about the future of New York City .
it was around 400 years ago , and they all came together to make a dent in the New York City of 100 years , and they concluded that , 100 years later , New York City will not exist .
why ? because they look at the line on the graph and say , if the population continue to grow at that speed , the people in New York are going to have to have six million horses , and six million <unk> will not be processed .
people are going to be submerged .
so in 1860 , they thought , this <unk> technology would kill the life of New York .
so what happens ? 40 years later , in 1900 , there was one , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- one , <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a new technology , and it &apos;s simply a subset of the little factories that are suspended .
for example , the Ford Motor Company in Lansing .
however , there &apos;s a secret to the entrepreneurs .
first of all , you &apos;re going to give them permission .
they won &apos;t come to you .
and then you have to offer them the passionate service .
you have to tell them what entrepreneurship is .
whether it &apos;s a large corporation or small business , it &apos;s going to put three things right : it &apos;s got to be effective , it &apos;s going to be smart .
what &apos;s the problem ?
there &apos;s never been a single person in the world who is able to produce and sell and finance .
it doesn &apos;t exist .
it &apos;s not even born .
we &apos;ve done a study of 100 power companies in the world -- the Carnegie Mellon Financial Corporation , the Edison , the Ford Motor Company , and all these companies , the <unk> , the Yahoo , the Yahoo .
all the successful businesses in the world have only one thing : no one is created by one .
we &apos;re now teaching young women at age 16 , and we &apos;re starting to put Richard Branson on the prior thing to this , the task of these students is to report and statistics on how many times Richard Branson and how many times we used this word &quot; The words and the words we use . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t , &quot; we &apos;ve used 32 times .
he was not alone at the beginning .
nobody could start a business alone . nobody .
so we can build a community , and in this community , we have the expertise from small businesses , small businesses , and in a pub , where you can go to a pub , where we can help you with this fellow aspirations , and we can ask you , &quot; What do you need ?
what do you do ? can you make it ?
can you sell it ? can you build the money ? &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t do that . &quot; is it okay for you ? &quot;
we inspire the community to do business .
we have volunteers who help to pool the resources and the human spirit , and what we find is that local people are able to create miracle cultural and economic changes in the community , as long as you can take the passion , this energy , this energy .
thank you .
five years ago , I had a live experience like Alice <unk> .
I got this teacher from Penn State University who taught me about communication , who was teaching the inner city of <unk> .
I was scared .
I was really frightened . these are the heads of the students , and the names they read , and the long @-@ lived words that they were using were all <unk> to me .
but as soon as the conversation started , my journey was just as Alice , down through that rabbit hole , saw it in a completely new way to a new world .
and that &apos;s what I felt when I was talking to the students , and I was amazed by their ideas , and I wanted others to experience that feeling in their heads .
I believe that the key to opening the gate is to have a great conversation .
in order to change the world , we need to get good communication from our scientists and engineers .
our scientists and engineers solve the biggest problem we face , and I believe we have a responsibility to interact with the environment , to health care , and so on . if we don &apos;t understand it , they don &apos;t have a meaning for us , and I believe we have a responsibility to interact with them as scientists .
but if our scientists and engineers aren &apos;t going to get us to look at their <unk> , we &apos;re not going to have good conversations .
so scientists and engineers , please tell us what high @-@ tech is .
I want to share with you a couple of useful ways to tell you how to make sure that we can make sure that we &apos;re sexy and sexy .
the first question is : what about high tech ?
tell us why your science is about us .
and I &apos;m going to tell you about <unk> <unk> , which is because this skeleton is very important to recognize and treatment .
and when you describe the scientific principle , look at the term .
the term is that we understand one of your ideas .
of course , you can say , &quot; Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
let your ideas be simple and insightful .
instead , as Einstein said , let &apos;s make everything as simple and not simplify .
you don &apos;t have to change your perspective to convey your scientific theory .
you can think of using examples and stories and analogies . these are the ones that excite you about content , to get us excited .
and I &apos;ll show you a few slides , but don &apos;t use points .
do you think about why some <unk> might call &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
what are the bombs ? the bullet can kill , and it can kill you .
it &apos;s not just boring , it &apos;s too dependent on our language areas that we don &apos;t know .
and this is an example made by <unk> Brown , which is much better . it shows us the extraordinary structure of the <unk> , even the unique design of the Eiffel Tower .
the trick here is to use simple , simple , linear sentences to allow the viewer to gain a deeper understanding of the subject , and then to provide some images that can inspire our senses , and to allow us to get a deeper understanding of the content .
so these are the key tools that I think will help us open up the gate , experience science and engineering .
and because the engineers who worked with me had taught me about the academic <unk> that I had inside me , I wanted to sum up my perspective .
to take your scientific study , take away your spots and jargon about content , which is to share what the audience is about , and multiplied by the passion that you &apos;re working on right now , that says yes : extremely conscious , incredibly interactive engagement .
so , scientists and engineers , when you solve the equation , everything is up to me , saying high @-@ tech .
thank you .
I love one of the words that I like to call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s not just because it sounds good .
and it means &quot; a <unk> politician . &quot;
even though this is just one of the 19th @-@ century editors pointing out a very good definition , he said , &quot; <unk> is a guy like this , he &apos;s going to pay no party , any stage or any rule , he &apos;s going to win the law . &quot;
I don &apos;t know what the <unk> is .
it &apos;s about talking to words about words , I suppose .
but speech is very important for the political center , and all politicians understand that they have to try and control their words .
for example , it &apos;s been sent to the late &apos; 90s to allow the news to cover the actual words that politicians speak .
and in fact , all of this is a brave man , this great name is <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s been suggested in Parliament .
he was incarcerated in London , but he was very brave enough to have enough courage in the parliament , and to the end that he had all the support that he had in London , won .
and just a few years later , we had the first draft of the term &quot; <unk> . &quot;
a lot of people think that phrases come out of metal .
no , it &apos;s a free @-@ press .
but to give you a sense of how words and politics influence each other , I want to take you back to the United States in the past when it &apos;s just finished .
there was a problem that they had to face was George Washington , and their leaders .
they don &apos;t know .
why should we be the leader of a republic ?
it was a long time ago in Congress .
and it made a lot of advice , which seemed to work .
I mean , some people want to call him the lead <unk> Washington , and some people call him George Washington , and others called him the &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> of Washington . &quot;
none of the names of the <unk> .
some people just want to call him the king .
they thought it was a term that was used and tested .
they don &apos;t even have a continuity of monarchy , and their idea was that you could have a fixed kings to vote .
you know , it probably works .
and everybody was tired , and in fact , because of this debate for three weeks .
I read a poor <unk> journal that said , &quot; Yes , it &apos;s the issue . &quot;
and the reason that it &apos;s bad is because it &apos;s the House of Representatives .
we don &apos;t want to let Washington D.C.
they don &apos;t want to call him the king in case what he or his <unk> would produce .
so they gave him a title that they could think , the worst , the worst , the worst , the worst title .
and this title is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> . they didn &apos;t make a title . I mean , it used to be , but it was the host of a conference .
it &apos;s similar to the president of the jury .
and it doesn &apos;t seem very high status at all .
there are a handful of little reports that have a government manage , but it &apos;s really not a title .
and that &apos;s why the Senate against this .
they said it was ridiculous , you couldn &apos;t call him a jirga .
this guy had to sign the Harris and then the <unk> .
who &apos;s going to take it seriously , and if he &apos;s got a very stupid title , like the AC <unk> , which is the <unk> of the IPCC ?
after three weeks of arguments , the last Senate has not been granted .
instead , they agree with the title of &quot; <unk> , &quot; but they also require absolute certainty that they &apos;re not going to agree on the title of the civilization @-@ state , whether it &apos;s the Democrats or the Republicans or the <unk> , they &apos;re going to get it through the head of the chief &apos;s office , and they don &apos;t want to be <unk> , &quot; -- &quot; The fact that we don &apos;t want to be <unk> .
now from this story you can learn three interesting things .
first of all , it was my favorite place , until now all the data that I could find , that the summit had never been properly granted to the title of the presidency .
Barack Obama , the title of &quot; President Obama , &quot; came to the point where they were waiting for the Senate .
the second thing you can see is that when the U.S. government says it &apos;s just a stopgap -- it lasts forever .
but the third thing you can understand , and it &apos;s a very important thing to remember , which is that the title , the president , has never been seen before , doesn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s about 5,000 weapons that he &apos;s dominated , and the largest economy in the world , and a whole bunch of military power .
reality and history gave this title of a noble meaning .
so the last Senate won .
they got a title they had to live .
and one of the other things that the headlines fear , the title sounds weird -- oh , it used to sound very odd .
but now , do you know how many countries now have a president ?
<unk> .
it &apos;s all because they want their title to sound like the guy with 5,000 weapons , etc . , etc .
so at the end of the boom , the Senate prevailed in the House of Representatives , because no one &apos;s been told that they are now president of the federal government .
and this is a very important lesson , which I think you can learn , which is the point that I want to leave you with .
politicians carefully choose the word , and they use the word &quot; shape &quot; and control reality , but in fact , the reality is far more than the reality of words .
thank you very much .
I was raised with 50 <unk> on the Champs @-@ Elysees , and I was 19 , a man who lived in <unk> and surfing <unk> .
I took my black <unk> , I changed my little , brown leather , and I looked at the sharp government &apos;s tank .
this is the first time I went to Afghanistan .
early on , I grew up in the war on weekends , watching a football game , watching a kid with a boy of racism , and participating in the religious march , shouting out , &quot; <unk> , Afghanistan ! &quot; and then even not even knowing what that means when it &apos;s burning , it &apos;s like a thousand <unk> , statue .
but it &apos;s self @-@ made .
so I &apos;m standing here today in Afghanistan , Afghanistan , and God &apos;s position for me , an atheist and a radical political artist , and I &apos;ve been in Afghanistan , working and doing .
in Afghanistan , you can show a lot of wonderful things by creating artwork , but I don &apos;t want to portray the words that I want to make an impact on the subject of an identity challenge , to actually explain the reality of reality , and even using a moral theory to understand the world that we live in .
I wanted to live a war with a <unk> , where he &apos;d been a <unk> <unk> in communism , just like the <unk> <unk> <unk> of popular singers , and using religious norms to make themselves rich .
these are the <unk> , except for the presidential elections , &quot; choose me . I &apos;m a jihad . I &apos;m a <unk> ! &quot; and what else can I do ?
I tried to <unk> out the <unk> of the <unk> , which made up of the heroes of the nation .
I wanted to see a project called Next Jump in Afghanistan , Afghanistan , and I simulate a police officer on the streets of Kabul , to stop those <unk> , to stop them and to give them a pie or to say to the police department of Kabul , to try to get them to the name of Afghanistan .
I want to know how to interpret Afghanistan with my view , and how that conflict has become an art of conflict .
the war and the exiled of the city of the War , how I created this very style and fashion that was designed by the soldiers and by the suicide bomber , I created a fashion which was supposed to bring the hairs in Afghanistan , and I added it to a pop bar with a pop bar .
and I &apos;d like to put together a simple <unk> and <unk> &apos;s <unk> on the wall to see how modern art is developed from the very top of the original <unk> presentation , the &quot; white &quot; to save the skin , and even a little bit of civilization .
but to do that , you might be in prison , and they would be accused of being wrong .
but I did what I had to do , because my self asked me to do .
that &apos;s what I do . what about you ?
thank you .
Hi , I &apos;m Cameron , which I used to be a model .
well , that &apos;s 10 years .
now , I &apos;m feeling a discomfort in this room because I shouldn &apos;t wear this dress .
thank you for having another set .
this is the first live stage at TED , so I think everybody here is very lucky .
if some of the women were terrified of me , I wouldn &apos;t have to tell me now , but I would Twitter in a minute .
and I want to tell you that I &apos;ve been lucky enough to change my image in 10 seconds .
it &apos;s not what everybody can do .
this high @-@ heels is uncomfortable , and the good news is I &apos;m not going to wear them .
the worst news is that I &apos;m going to take the sweater off the head , because you &apos;re going to laugh at me , so when I wear it , you &apos;re not going to do anything .
it &apos;s okay .
so why did I do this ?
it &apos;s odd .
I don &apos;t want to feel like this on a picture .
it &apos;s powerful , but it &apos;s also self @-@ expressive .
I just changed my image in six seconds .
in this picture , I actually don &apos;t have a boyfriend in real life .
when the photographer had to memorize the back , I was very uneasy .
and sure enough , besides surgery , or like two days ago , I was trying to make the brown sheet for my work , which was basically impossible to change our appearance , even though it was <unk> , and it had a huge impact on our lives .
so today , for me , the pace of change means being honest .
I &apos;m here today because I &apos;m a model .
I &apos;m on this stage because I &apos;m a beautiful , white woman , and we call it &quot; sexy girl . &quot;
I have to answer the question that people often ask me is in a very honest way .
the first problem is , how do you become a model ?
I always say , &quot; I &apos;m found , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t work .
and the real reason I became a model is that I have some good genes , and I &apos;m an inheritance , and you may be wondering what the legacy is .
well , in the last couple of centuries , what we define as beauty is not just health , it &apos;s young and small shapes , but all the things that we depend on to celebrate are biological , slim , female , white , skin .
this is my legacy . this is my legacy .
I know some of you may have had some kind of a clue to this view , and you might have some fashion characters like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
first of all , I want to give you a sense of what a model might look like .
but unfortunately , I have to tell you that , in 2007 , a Ph.D. from NYU , had been inspired by measuring all the numbers of people who were working in business models , were paid in the first quarter , weren &apos;t in four percent .
the next question that I was asked was , &quot; Can I grow up to be a model ? &quot;
my first answer was , &quot; I don &apos;t know , because they didn &apos;t let me get this done . &quot;
but the second answer , which I want to ask , is , &quot; Why ? &quot;
you know what ? you can choose any profession .
you can be the president of the United States , or the inventor of the next generation , or the <unk> <unk> , the better one , because you &apos;re the first .
if you listen to this , they say , &quot; No , no , I want to be a model , &quot; and I say , &quot; When my boss ? &quot;
because I can &apos;t decide anything , you can be the head of <unk> magazine , or you can be the CEO of <unk> magazine , or the next <unk> .
when you grow up , you want to be a model , you say , you want to win the lottery .
you can &apos;t be a model . it &apos;s not within your grasp . it &apos;s a wonderful business model , but it &apos;s not a sustainable business .
I &apos;m going to show you some of my models for the past 10 years , because unlike a hyper @-@ Japanese poet , it can only stand today .
so if the photographer is here , the lights are right here -- you know , beautiful <unk> , and I want to walk a shoot , &quot; This long , long @-@ lost arm , put it back in the back , this little three @-@ quarters , which goes back up and down , and look back , and look back , and look back , and look back , and forth .
it looks like this .
it &apos;s not like the one in the middle .
I don &apos;t know how the bell tolls .
the reality is , when you graduate , you have a résumé , and you have a <unk> job , you don &apos;t have another one , so if you say you want to be president , but on your résumé , the <unk> of a 10 @-@ year period , people will laugh at you .
the next question that people were asking was , &quot; Are they looking for pictures ? &quot;
yes , they took almost all the photographs , but it was a small part of the work .
this is my first prototype of a model , and it was my first time in my pocket that I &apos;d never been in before .
I know it &apos;s a little private , but I was young then .
this is a picture that I photographed with my grandmother a few months ago .
this is a picture of the day .
my friend was there with me .
this is a picture that I photographed in France a few days ago in my pajamas .
this is a picture of me at the <unk> and V @-@ Day magazine .
this is me right now .
I want you to understand that these are not my photographs .
it &apos;s an image of a group of professionals , of <unk> , of photographers , of <unk> , of their <unk> , of their <unk> , of their <unk> , of their <unk> , of making these images instead of me .
the next question is , &quot; Can you get free ? &quot;
I do have a lot of eight inches of high heels that I &apos;d never been able to wear , but free is what I get in the real world , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t want to talk about .
I was at Cambridge , and I was in Cambridge , and I was walking into a store and I forgot money to send me a dress .
when I was a teenager , I was driving along with my friend , and she was a bad driver , and we were stopped , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , &quot; and we &apos;re on the road .
I got these because my appearance wasn &apos;t me . some people pay for their appearance instead of identity .
I live in New York City , and I have 14 million young boys last year , and 86 percent of them are black and Latino , mostly young boys .
and in New York City , young black men and Latino men are only 17 million , so the question is , &quot; Am I going to be parking ? &quot;
it &apos;s like , &quot; I &apos;m going to get a couple of times ? when am I going to be stopped ? &quot;
when I was investigating this talk , I found that in 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls in the United States , 53 percent of their bodies were 17 years old , and that ratio went up to 78 percent .
so the last question is , &quot; What does a model feel like ? &quot;
and I guess the answer that they &apos;re expecting is , &quot; If you &apos;re a little bit thinner , your hair &apos;s got a bit more <unk> , it &apos;s incredible . &quot;
when it comes back , we give a answer like this .
we said , &quot; To travel and to be creative , passionate , to work together . &quot;
it &apos;s only true , but it &apos;s only half the fact that we &apos;re not going to say before the lens , and I &apos;m never going to say , &quot; I don &apos;t feel safe . &quot;
because I have to worry about me every day .
if you &apos;ve ever thought about it , if my thighs are thinner , am I going to be happier ?
you can just go and look at models because they have the most thin foot , the most beautiful hair , the coolest clothes , and they may be the most <unk> woman in the world .
so when I was prepared for this talk , it was hard to find a sense of honesty , because on the one hand , I said , &quot; Look , I &apos;ve got so much in my natural advantage , &quot; in my heart , it &apos;s not good for me , but it &apos;s not good for me .
but the hard thing to do is to show gender and racism , because I am the best person in my life .
but at the same time , I was very happy and respected , and I was young , not working for 10 , 20 , 30 years or 30 years of business , and I wasn &apos;t going to get the most direct feeling , because maybe I wasn &apos;t going to get the first to work , which is so important .
if this talk gives you an idea , I hope we can all embrace the power of images and the success and the failure that we understand .
thank you .
I just want one thing today .
don &apos;t say I &apos;m normal .
I want to introduce you to my two brothers .
this year &apos;s 22 years old .
he didn &apos;t speak , but he was able to convey a sense of pleasure in his very particular way , and the best of his talk was <unk> .
he knows what love is .
he would have been <unk> to share his love .
he &apos;s not <unk> , he doesn &apos;t care what the skin is .
he didn &apos;t care about the difference in religion , and he said , &quot; He never says no .
when he was singing about our childhood <unk> , even though I &apos;d forgotten the words , he reminds me of the wonder and the unknown things that we know about .
the second year is 16 , and it &apos;s extremely hot .
he had an extraordinary memory .
but the memory is selective .
he didn &apos;t remember to steal my chocolate , but remember when I was in my iPod , when I was four years old , we were talking about <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Lady Gaga , on my arm .
sounds amazing ?
but a lot of people don &apos;t think that .
the fact is , because their thinking doesn &apos;t match normal norms for normal people , they &apos;re often isolated and wrong .
but what troubles me is that even though they &apos;re not as normal as human beings , it &apos;s just one thing that &apos;s remarkable , though , having autism , but is extremely surprising .
some of you may not be familiar with autism , which is a term which is made of complex brain disorders , social disorders , learning disorder , sometimes sport dysfunction in the functional brain .
every single one of these cases is unique , so different from Sam .
in the world , every 20 minutes , there &apos;s a new type of autism diagnosis , which is one of the fastest @-@ growing diseases in the world , but we don &apos;t know why it &apos;s so good and how it can be treated .
I first learned that , &quot; autism is a word , &quot; and I have a day where I know nothing about autism .
when I was three years old , my brother was born and I was so excited that I had a new family .
and just a few months later , I realized he was different .
he was screaming .
he wasn &apos;t willing to play like any other baby , and he was actually kind of interested in me .
he was immersed in his own world , using the rules that he made , and he looked at things that were neat , like , looking around the room , and staring at everything he had between his and his machine .
when he got older , he became more unique in these special places .
in addition to the usual suspects , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> nature of his life , was that he had never seen the world .
it &apos;s not easy .
I couldn &apos;t tell my family that it was difficult , and I thought they were like me .
but I was thinking about the things that they taught me about individuality , about communication , about love and love , and I realized that these things are not going to be normal either .
&quot; normal , &quot; neglect , &quot; is the difference between the beautiful and the human side .
it just says , &quot; Yes , there are different kinds of things . &quot;
I just want to say one thing : for Sam , you don &apos;t have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
whether it &apos;s autism or not , our gaps -- every one of us has a gift that we &apos;re comfortable with , and honestly , &quot; normal , &quot; is to kill the potential .
the possibility of transcendence , progress and change is the possibility that we want to lose ourselves with others .
don &apos;t say &quot; I &apos;m normal . &quot;
thank you .
Dr. <unk> took this gun to help us reach out and curiosity , and this is a photograph that only one in a million seconds .
but now , 50 years later , we can get a million times faster , not just in a single second , or a billionth of a second , but in a billion seconds , we can capture the world .
now I &apos;m going to show you a new technology called <unk> imaging , which is a technology that can capture light very quickly .
so with this technology , we can make a camera that can see beyond the lens of the lights , or without X @-@ rays of our bodies , and the camera challenges the definition of the camera .
now , if I use a laser pen , and in a trillion @-@ second power switch -- that &apos;s a few seconds -- I &apos;m going to make some photons , all these photons are photons , and these photons are photons , and they &apos;re like a bullet , which is a million times faster than speed .
now , what if you could shoot this gun , these photons into the bottle , how would these photons hit the bottle ?
what &apos;s the slow cycle ?
now , the whole thing .
now , remember , this whole thing is happening inside a <unk> -- the <unk> time -- but now I &apos;m going to slow this video a million times , and I &apos;m going to let you see the light in the movement .
but Coke has not funded the experiment .
now , there &apos;s a lot of stuff going on here , so let me give you a demonstration .
now , the beam of light goes into the fire , which is our shooting through the bottle , and puts it inside .
some of the lines come out of the table , so you start to see these patterns .
a lot of photons eventually get to the caps and go all the way around .
as you can see , this is an air bubble , it <unk> inside .
at the same time , the ripples hit the table , and because of the reflection at the top , you can see that at the bottom of the bottle , the ripples hit .
now , if you &apos;re going to walk the same vehicle , slow it down , again , again , a million times , do you know how much you need to wait to see this sequence ?
one day , what about a week ? actually , a year .
it would be boring , it would be ordinary gun play .
but how about some <unk> ?
you can see the waves pop up on the table , the background is tomatoes and wall .
it &apos;s like throwing a rock in the tank .
I think that &apos;s how nature builds tomatoes , a <unk> , but of course what we &apos;re looking at is the holistic integration .
but if you look at this tomatoes , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> is walking around on a tomato , it &apos;s always <unk> . it &apos;s not darkened .
why ? because tomatoes know , and <unk> , comes out of a million seconds after a thousands of seconds .
so , in the future , the camera is <unk> in your cell phone , you can go to a supermarket , you can &apos;t see if the fruit is good .
so how did I make a camera at MIT ?
now , as a photographer , you know , if you &apos;re going to have a little bit of light , but we &apos;re going to have a million times faster than the smallest , so you &apos;re almost not going to get any light .
so what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re making these photons all the way up to 100 million times , and then we &apos;re shooting them in a very good <unk> , and we &apos;re releasing a map , and this is what you saw before .
and we take all the raw data and we apply it to interesting processes .
now , superhero is a superhero .
some other heroes can be invisible , but think of a future superhero : he can see what &apos;s behind .
that &apos;s how we can get some door door to the door .
and these lights reflect into the room , and some of the lights go back into the door and go into the camera so that we can use the reflection .
it &apos;s not true . we did .
on the left you see our <unk> camera .
in the back of the wall , we &apos;re going to do a bid .
so , in our research , we published &quot; Nature , &quot; which was recommend , online , and they created this cartoon .
we &apos;re going to launch these bullets , and they &apos;re going to hit the wall , and because the light is going to reach all the way , some of them will eventually hit us , and will continue to know that the gate will bounce back into the camera , and some of the light will go back to the camera , but it will be fun .
and because we have a camera that can run so fast , that &apos;s our <unk> camera , and that camera has some unique capabilities .
it has good time resolution , and it can capture the world at the speed of light .
so , not only do we know where the camera is going , but we don &apos;t know where the separation is .
by using lasers , we can record a primitive picture , which is what you see on the screen , which is kind of irrelevant , but then we can take a lot of photos , put it together , and then we can look at the reflection , and now we can see the hidden object ?
can we look at the stereo ?
this is our prototype .
now we can take them to life , but in the future , we can put this technology into the car so that we can prevent collisions , because they can see survivors , or we can look at the lights , or we can see the lights in the windows , or we can see the lights , or we can see the lights , or we can see the lights .
but of course , because of the dynamics of tissues and blood , it &apos;s very hard to get a scientist to really value the <unk> , to bring this technology into a new model of health .
now , like Dr. <unk> <unk> , a scientist , science has become art , a high @-@ speed , and I realize that every time we collect lots of data , not just science imaging , but a new <unk> photography that contains the <unk> and color code , we &apos;re looking at these 10 times , and it &apos;s just one of those ripples .
but something interesting is happening .
when you see the pattern of the lid , they &apos;re moving away .
but these waves should move us .
what happened ?
and it turns out , because we &apos;re very close to the speed of light , we have some bizarre phenomena , and Einstein is very happy to see these images .
the sequence of events is sometimes flipped into the camera , so by <unk> the pace of time and space , we can actually fix this curve .
so whether it &apos;s in the corner , or whether it &apos;s for the next generation , or whether it &apos;s the creation of a new visualization , and since our invention , we &apos;ve put all the information online , and we hope , the DIY , this creative group can tell us that we &apos;re not supposed to be interested in the technologies that we should be interested in .
it &apos;s time . thank you .
this is where I live , Kenya , in the southern Mediterranean of Nairobi National Park .
behind me was my father &apos;s cattle in the back of the cow , in Nairobi National Park .
the southern part of the National Park has not been <unk> , which means that in zebras , they can move out of the park .
so predators like lions follow them , and that &apos;s what they do .
they killed our livestock .
and this is a cow that was killed at night , and I found that it was dead in the morning , and I was overwhelmed , because it was the only <unk> I had in my family .
our Maasais believe that we are bringing our animals and our home to the clean , to live , and that &apos;s why we value them .
so I became very <unk> to lions .
the whole point of the military is that they protect our families and our livestock , but they &apos;re also depressed about the problem , they &apos;re frustrated .
so they decided to shoot these lions .
this is one of six lions killed in Nairobi National Park .
I think this is the reason why the <unk> park in Nairobi was so poor .
in our family , six to nine @-@ year @-@ old boys have the responsibility to protect their fathers , the same thing happened to me .
so I have to figure out a way to solve a problem .
the first way I thought about it was to use fire , because I know lions are scared of fire .
but I realized it didn &apos;t work , it didn &apos;t help the lion to see our <unk> .
but I didn &apos;t give up . I kept quiet .
so here &apos;s the second way : use the <unk> .
I &apos;d like to deceive lions to get them right next to me .
but lions are very clever .
they saw the first day , and they went back , but the next day , they would come back and say , &quot; This thing has never been done before , and he &apos;s here .
so they &apos;re killing the animals .
and one evening , I was walking with the <unk> , and that night , lions didn &apos;t come .
I began to realize that lions are going to fear the light of moving .
so I had another idea .
because I was a little kid , I could just go all day , I could do something else in my room for half a day , and I even <unk> my mother &apos;s radio , and that day she nearly killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
so I found a old <unk> , a replica , and this is a small equipment that was found in a motorcycle that was used to control the <unk> of the motorbike , to shine a light .
and I found a switch , and I could control the light from the lights .
the light bulb came from a broken flashlights .
everything was ready .
and as you can see , the solar cell picks up the battery , and then the batteries give the pointer that I call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and this is what makes the light a bit different .
you can see , the light bulb was <unk> , because lions come from there .
and when the lion walks up at night , it looks like this .
the light that would allow the lion to get carried away from me would think that I was walking around the net , but in fact , at this point I was doing a big job in my bed .
thank you .
I put this in my home two years ago , and since that time , we don &apos;t have a lion &apos;s crashing .
my neighbors had heard about it .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a whole bunch of <unk> fed @-@ up with lions , and she asked me if I could help her make a light at home .
I can &apos;t help .
I have these lights , and you can see behind them , these are <unk> .
and so far , I &apos;ve been able to get this out of our family , which is very useful .
now , my approach has been used for everybody in Kenya to avoid other predator @-@ like animals , the hyena , and the leopard is used to protect the elephant from the farm .
and I was very lucky to get a fellowship because of the invention , this is the best school in Kenya -- international school , I was very excited about it .
my new school is now coming in and supporting me to raise more money .
I even brought my friends back to my community , to help them build this in their homes that didn &apos;t have legislative power .
a year ago , I was just a big savanna to help my dad , and I used to look at the plane , and tell myself , someday , I &apos;ll be in there .
today , I did .
I got a chance to come to TED , and this is my first time .
so my great dream is that when I grew up , I became an airplane engineer and a pilot .
I used to hate lions , but now , because of my invention , I saved my father &apos;s cow and we were able to get lions alive .
thank you very much . in my language , it means very much .
you don &apos;t believe how inspiring the story is .
so you &apos;ve got the scholarship . Richard <unk> : yeah .
are you doing another electron inventing ?
what &apos;s next ?
<unk> : my next invention was , I wanted to make a electric bar .
<unk> : I know , the electricity booms are already there , but I just want to make my own one .
you &apos;ve tried it one time , right , but you -- <unk> : I &apos;ve tried it before , but I &apos;ve stopped it because it really struck me .
it &apos;s a <unk> . Richard <unk> , you &apos;re special .
we &apos;re going to do every step you &apos;re growing up , friends .
thank you very much . <unk> : thank you .
I live in Los Angeles .
this is L.A. <unk> : <unk> , hotel , shelter , land .
so the planners of the city sit together and talk about what the L.A. <unk> is about , so they changed it to South L.A. , as if it were to tackle the real problems of the city .
this is South Los Angeles .
<unk> hotels , food restaurants , all over the place .
like about 200 million Americans , I live in a food desert , and Los Angeles is a business model for fast food , where consumers don &apos;t have to get out of their car and their homes .
what &apos;s interesting is that there are more people who have made a car that will kill more .
in Los Angeles , people died of a cure .
for example , I live in a block that &apos;s five times more likely than I could say , eight times more likely than I am .
I &apos;m tired of the reality .
and I &apos;m thinking , what if there &apos;s no way to get healthy food , what do you feel if you come out of your home and see the food systems in your community , what &apos;s your feeling ?
I saw the wheelchair as a bought for @-@ profit .
I see <unk> centers like Starbucks .
I don &apos;t want to get there anymore .
I think the answer is hidden in the question .
food is a problem , and food is a solution .
plus , I &apos;m tired , I &apos;m going to go back and buy a 45 @-@ minute <unk> of pesticides .
so what I did was I put food into my house .
it &apos;s in what we call a <unk> .
150 feet by 10 feet .
it &apos;s all government .
but people have to keep it clean .
so I thought , &quot; Great ! this is my responsibility , I have to maintain it , so I want to do something ! &quot;
that &apos;s why I want to keep it .
so I was working with my group , &quot; Los Angeles , &quot; and we got together to grow our own food forests , green food and full @-@ length vegetables .
we are a free organization , a construction of different cities , all of which volunteers , all of us are doing .
the garden is beautiful .
but very quickly , somebody complained .
the government accused me , and gave me an alert to prove that I had to remove my garden , and then become a warning .
I was like , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? what &apos;s going on ?
it wasn &apos;t until a small patch of land that wasn &apos;t there , but nobody was paying attention ?
and I thought , &quot; Great , come on . &quot;
because it didn &apos;t happen .
so the Los Angeles Times ran , and Steve <unk> wrote a story about its story and its legislators , a three @-@ dimensional group of people who were going to have a petition to <unk> , and gathered it to 900 <unk> , we succeeded .
we do it with our hands .
he even came to see how he had admired and loved what we were doing .
I mean , of course , how can they do that ?
the amount of empty space in Los Angeles has in the bottom of the U.S.
it has 26 kilometers of empty space .
that &apos;s 20 Central Park .
there &apos;s enough space to grow 250 million tomato sauce .
why do they feel so bad ?
a single tree can be received from 1,000 , or a million seed .
a dollar of <unk> could bring 75 dollars to your harvest .
it &apos;s my mantra , I tell people , grow your food .
it &apos;s like a little <unk> .
look , I have a legacy in Los Angeles .
I grew up there , and I raised my son there .
I &apos;m not going to be a part of the reality that other people build for me , and I &apos;m going to create my reality .
see , I &apos;m an artist .
the work was my graffiti , and I created my art .
it &apos;s like the graffiti artist , <unk> the wall , and I , <unk> the lawns .
I see the garden and land as canvas , and plants and trees are the decoration of the canvas that I have on the canvas .
you may be shocked to do what the land can do if you think of it as your canvas .
you can &apos;t imagine how amazing it is for sunflowers , and how it will affect people .
what happens ?
I saw my gardens became an educational tool to become a tool for my community reform .
to change the community , you have to change the components of soil .
we are soil .
you are amazed by how children are affected .
the gardening movement is the most healthy and challenging activity in the downtown .
you can also harvest strawberries .
I remember one day , a mother and daughter came out of nowhere at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , and when I came out , they were embarrassed .
their presence made me feel very bad , and I told them that you don &apos;t have to take food like this .
that &apos;s why the garden was in the street .
when I saw the people around me , it made me feel very valuable . it made me a decision . people asked me , &quot; Would you mind stealing you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Of course I &apos;m not , I &apos;m sure people steal it .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
that &apos;s what I wanted .
I want people to take it , but at the same time , I want people to be healthy . &quot;
and one time , when I was in downtown Los Angeles , I built a garden .
these guys helped me not have the potential .
it &apos;s really cool , they &apos;re sharing about how the garden is reacting to them , how they &apos;re related to their mothers and their grandmother , and they &apos;re able to see that the garden can change the very cool thing for that moment .
green connectivity started to be a 20 garden .
we already have about 50 people involved in our team , all volunteered .
if the kids planted the <unk> , the kids ate the <unk> .
if they plant the tomato , they eat the tomato .
but when these kids don &apos;t present in front of their eyes , if they don &apos;t experience how food affects people &apos;s thoughts and bodies , they &apos;re just blind eating any food in front of them .
I saw young people who wanted to work , but they were happy to spend time with this , and I saw children with different skin color , and they were always <unk> on their way to design for them , and there was a road .
when I was doing the gardening activity , I found a chance that we could train these kids over their communities and live a sustainable life .
when we do that , who knows whether we &apos;re going to .
the next George Washington ?
but if we don &apos;t change the soil , we &apos;ll never do that .
it made me a current project . this is what I wanted to do .
I want a whole <unk> garden of a neighborhood where people can share food .
I wanted to convert the container for health .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
I didn &apos;t think free , because free is free .
and the interesting thing about sustainability is that you have to keep it .
what I &apos;m talking about is getting people to work , to get their kids out of the street , to get their joy , to the joy of planting food , to the open farmers .
so what I &apos;d like to do is to make the project more appealing .
I want us to be the president of the environmental revolution , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to have to fix the tie of the <unk> .
if you &apos;re not a <unk> , you &apos;re not a <unk> .
who &apos;s got a <unk> Yogi ?
let &apos;s make it your choice .
basically , if you want to meet me , if you want to meet me , if you want to sit on a comfortable chair and talk about some of the missing ones .
if you want me to take a <unk> and come to a garden , then we can do something about it .
well , thank you .
thank you .
in March of 2011 , I was a photography <unk> , New York City .
we are <unk> , <unk> .
we are in a room of pitch , darkness , no windows , mostly for sunlight .
we make it thinner , we make it thinner , we make it more realistic , we make the impossible possible , but we are being judged by the media , but we are actually gifted artist , working images , understanding photography and photography .
on March 11 , 2011 , I saw the tragedy of Japan at home .
and not long after that , I was in a group of volunteers , and the team was immediately organized , just within a few days , in a local disaster .
I know this with other volunteers : we can &apos;t be at home , and so I decided to join them for three weeks to volunteer .
on May 13 , I came to Japan .
it was a small fishing village in Japan , where about 50,000 people were , where they were victims of a disaster during the time .
the tsunami at the height of the day was over 24 meters , and it hit about two miles of inland .
you can imagine , this little town must be respected .
we took the canal and the <unk> .
we can help schools and the children that are lost to clean , clean , <unk> .
we cleaned up a lot of <unk> , aggressive fish , and the fish were all local factories and processed fish .
we all became <unk> and smelly , but we were <unk> .
and within a few weeks , all the volunteers and all the residents found something like this .
they keep discovering photos , <unk> , camera , <unk> .
everybody &apos;s response and doing the same .
they took all these photographs and took them and took them to <unk> them .
until now , I realized that these photographs must be a big part of the loss .
when they get attacked by the tsunami , you can imagine , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got these other things , you &apos;ve got everything left behind .
I spent the last couple of days in Japan , and I found myself at a place to save the <unk> .
help a clean cleaner <unk> the giant <unk> .
it happened to be a photo that was lost in the area of the slum .
people sent the photo to the <unk> , and I was very lucky enough to get their trust , to get me to clean , to get back to the photos .
and it was very struck , and it was very inspiring , and I was listening to people and saying , &quot; Be creative , until that time cleaning the picture , I actually did something called &quot; innovation . &quot;
when I go through those photos , there are more than 100 years of history , and some of them are still in the midst of the process , I have a very hard time thinking about it from a single @-@ eye perspective , and maybe I can help them repair the photos of the <unk> and the <unk> , and I know a lot of people will help them recover the photos .
so , on that evening , I went to Facebook and I asked some <unk> friends the next morning , and there was a lot of news , saying they were willing to help , and I knew we were going to do it .
so we started <unk> .
this is the first shot .
it wasn &apos;t a big deal , but it was caught in the presence of a girl &apos;s face , and we had to be careful , and we had to be able to fix it carefully .
otherwise , the little girl &apos;s face doesn &apos;t look like her face -- the tragedy of the tragedy , just like the picture .
over time , more and more photos have been transported around , and we need more than a dozen more procedures to process these photos , so I went back to Facebook and professional links , five days , to get help from 12 different countries .
in two weeks , I got 150 volunteers and they were willing to join us .
and as of course , only in Japan , we set up a small <unk> with <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the north .
every week , we are creating instruments in discrete groups , and people come in and photographed them .
sometimes , some of the older women have never seen a scanner before , and they find photos that they &apos;ve lost in 10 minutes , they can send us a picture , put it into the cloud , and then the images that will be shipped to a non @-@ Japanese or strangers , that might be downloaded from the other side of the Earth at the same time .
however , at that time , they took the picture very different , which , of course , depends on the level of injury .
it may be possible for an hour to fix it , and it might take about a couple of weeks .
a few months .
the beauty of the picture has to be processed by hand , or by inch , or by inch , or by putting the colors of the dead , and processing the detail that doesn &apos;t exist in the water .
the whole process is very much time .
all of these photographs that are affected by the tsunami , bathed in the <unk> of bacteria , the <unk> of the garbage , and sometimes even the oil @-@ <unk> , all of these photographs that were once made possible , so a giant component of this project .
and if these images don &apos;t clean , we can &apos;t fix them , and before we repair them , they &apos;ve got to dry , they &apos;ve got to dry .
our hand @-@ washing exercise is very good .
there &apos;s a lady who &apos;s been guiding us .
these pictures are easy to damage once again .
as my captain of the <unk> , he used to say , this is about tattoos .
you can &apos;t have any <unk> , or you can get a mess .
the woman who showed us these photographs was very lucky , and in that picture .
she started to clean the picture , until she realized that she had made more damage to the picture .
well , she had a picture of a copy .
otherwise , in the photograph , she and her face would not be completely <unk> , and we would be able to put all the parts into a good image and then re @-@ create this picture .
when she took the picture here , she shared a story with us .
her picture was actually found by her husband &apos;s colleague , and what she found was that , after the local fire force , the place was actually very far away from her house , they recognized him .
on the day of the tsunami , he was making sure that the storm is closed .
the alarm goes off , he has to reach the front of the tsunami .
her two sons , though , are quite big , are still in two different schools .
one of the kids is hit by the tsunami .
she &apos;d spent a week <unk> her family , and they &apos;d been divorced .
and we returned to her on the day of her photograph , and it was her 14th birthday .
for her , though , the deep , tragic calamity was given to him that the photograph was the best gift to his son , that the photograph allowed him to examine , to regain his memory , it was no longer a day to leave him with his life when everything was changed , or it was destroyed .
after six months in Japan , &quot; <unk> , &quot; a quarter of a million volunteers are going to help Japan help us to clean up more than five million photos , most of which - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
most of it ends up in the skating <unk> , which is very important .
more than 500 volunteers around the world helped us find 90 family photos , all of these photographs were reconstructed and repaired .
in this case , we didn &apos;t spend $ <unk> dollars for a device or a material , most of it was done using a printer .
we take pictures .
it &apos;s a picture of a reminder and a reminder that some of us , some of the people , some places , are emotional , someone who is happy .
they &apos;re helping us recording , remembering , our past , our photos are the easiest time to be ignored , but sometimes the first thing we want to get back .
and this is all the little pieces of the project to try to restore human nature , to save people from the past .
when this picture hits its owner , it will bring a big difference , and it will bring a very different life to the end .
the project also changed a lot .
for some <unk> , this journey has been built for them to connect to some of the bigger things , such as social feedback , that allows them to be able to use , not only for a model , but for a beautiful skin .
I want to end by giving you an email , and I get a letter from <unk> , six months after that day in Japan .
&quot; when I was fixing the photographs , I was struck by the people and the stories that came out of the photos .
and it was particularly a woman who took a picture of all the women , and she went to the grandmother , and she walked around a little baby , and it was a real hit , because I had a picture of my mother , my mother , my mother , and my daughter , and this picture was in my house .
throughout the globe , beyond the age limit , we have some of the most basic needs , right ? &quot;
thank you .
today , I want to talk about a disconcerting question , and the answer to that question is just a really disturbing question .
I &apos;m going to talk about the secrets of domestic abuse , and the question that I &apos;m going to answer is , &quot; Why is she leaving ? &quot;
how could anyone want to live with her man ? &quot;
I &apos;m not a psychopath , or social worker .
I &apos;m just a woman with a personal story .
I was 22 years old , and I graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York , and I started my first job as Time magazine and <unk> .
I had my first house . I had the first credit card . I had a very big secret .
and that secret was that I was once thought to be a man of my soul using this to fill out a fresh , thick gun at my head so many times .
this guy that I had always loved , pointed at my head and threatened to kill me , and I &apos;ve forgotten how many times I &apos;ve done .
now the story that I &apos;m telling about &quot; romantic love &quot; is a psychological trap of romantic love , where millions of women each year , and even some men fell into this trap .
maybe it &apos;s happening to you .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic warrior .
I had the English education degree at Harvard , and I got an MBA degree in computer marketing .
most of the time is working for the Fortune 500 companies , including Johnson , <unk> and Washington .
I married my husband for almost 20 years with three children .
he built a black <unk> , he opened the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s the first thing I want to tell you about : that domestic abuse may not have to happen to everybody , faith , income and education .
it &apos;s everywhere .
the second thing that I &apos;m going to say is that a lot of people think that the domestic violence should be women &apos;s issues .
no .
over 85 percent of the <unk> are men , and the only places that happen to remain intimate , <unk> , long @-@ term relationships , in other words , in families , it &apos;s one of the most reluctant or most reluctant to see violence , and that &apos;s one of the reasons why it &apos;s so called domestic abuse .
I used to think that only one of my men in the world will continue to stay with me , but in fact , at this age is very common .
I was 22 years old . and in the United States , 16 to 24 @-@ year @-@ old women were more likely to be abused than any other women in the United States , every year in the United States , more than 500 women or boys were killed , or their husband .
I &apos;m a very typical victim , and I don &apos;t know nothing about my domestic abuse and development .
I met a <unk> , and it was January , freezing .
we sat around in New York City , and he talked to me first .
he told me two things .
the first is that he graduated with the <unk> School , and worked in a very good Wall Street .
but the first thing that happened to me was his wisdom and humor , and his <unk> look like a farm .
his face looks like a giant <unk> of wheat , which looks pretty good .
the most clever thing that I had done in the first few days was to convince me that I was a strong side .
and at the beginning , he made me think that I was a big icon of his .
we started to connect , and he liked everything about me , like my wise , and I was at Harvard &apos;s school , and I was giving young women &apos;s sleep , and my job .
he was willing to understand my family , my childhood , my wish and dream .
as a woman had never been there before .
through his unknown secrets , he creates this incredible emotional atmosphere between us , and he told me that he had been a four @-@ year @-@ old and @-@ a @-@ year @-@ old that he &apos;d been <unk> to his body , and the result of that was so <unk> that he had to leave in eighth grade , while he &apos;d been so intelligent .
and that &apos;s why the high @-@ school degree , the job and the light in the future , was significant to him .
if somebody at the time said to me that wise , humorous , <unk> and liking for my man one day to decide whether I wear makeup , my skirt is short , I live there , what am I going to do , where I am going to live with my friends and where Christmas lights are , I &apos;m going to be ridiculed , because I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and I didn &apos;t know that , <unk> and <unk> were the first step in the war .
I didn &apos;t know that the next step was a victim .
and the second one is not going to come home and announce to me , &quot; Hey , while the great news of <unk> and so forth , but we &apos;re going to get into the next phase , and I &apos;m going to leave you with your friends and family . &quot;
and the fact is , he went home on a Friday night to tell me he quit his job , and he was always working , and he said he &apos;d quit his job because I &apos;d left him alone , and he didn &apos;t have to go to Wall Street and prove that he didn &apos;t want to leave the town right now , that he didn &apos;t want to leave his life in New England .
and what I didn &apos;t want to do at the time was to leave New York City and leave my passion , but for my soul , I thought I needed to make a sacrifice . so I quit my job and I left the Manhattan with the <unk> .
I thought I &apos;d been trapped into a crazy romantic love , and I didn &apos;t know I &apos;d been walking into a custom , soul and economic trap .
the phase of the domestic violence is the beginning of violence and observing her response .
this is what the gun used .
we just moved to the town of New England -- I think , the <unk> should be feeling safe here -- he bought a <unk> gun .
a single put in a car truck .
a pillow underneath the bed , the <unk> are always in the pocket .
he said that when he was a kid , he needed the gun .
to keep him safe .
the gun was a obvious signal to me , even though he didn &apos;t pick the tip to me , I was already on the edge of a danger .
I was five days before our weddings .
it was the morning <unk> , and I was wearing <unk> .
I &apos;m working on a computer , I &apos;m trying to finish the <unk> mission , and I was <unk> , and I was overwhelmed with my anger , with my hands , my neck , my <unk> , to get my breath out of the back , to my neck .
five days later , 10 fingers on my neck was <unk> , and I was wearing my mother &apos;s <unk> , married him .
and even though that happens , I still believe that we are going to be happy , because we are so loved .
he expressed his depth .
he just got too much pressure , and the wedding <unk> and the family came to him .
this is an accident , and he won &apos;t hurt me later .
I was struck twice during the mop day .
for the first time , I was driving to search for the secret beach , and I was lost , and he was stuck in my head , and it was so heavy that I could take my head down into the seat of the seat .
<unk> , who &apos;s been on the road to drive home to get home , drives him down , and he &apos;s choking a cold Big Mac in my face .
in my two and a half year @-@ old <unk> , I was beaten twice a week .
I had always had this accident that I was alone .
in fact , one of the three American women had been a victim or potentially foreign goals , and the report of <unk> @-@ million @-@ a @-@ year @-@ olds abuse , 150,000 children a year .
so in fact , I &apos;m not alone .
back to my question : why am I going to stay ?
the answer is simple .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
even though he pointed to my head with the <unk> gun , he pushed me to a halt , threatening my dog , <unk> the car on the freeway , to try to get off my head for an interview , I never thought I was a abuse of my wife .
in contrast , I was a very hard woman in love with this troubled man , and I was the only one in the world that could help but face my face .
the other question you all want to ask is , why don &apos;t she leave ?
why don &apos;t I flee ? I have a lot of opportunities .
for me , this is the most challenging question people have ever asked me about , how bad it is , how dangerous it is to leave our victims , but only how dangerous it is .
because the last step of the domestic abuse is to kill her .
more than 70 percent of the domestic violence had happened after the victim , and after she left , because the perpetrator has been <unk> .
other possible outcomes include longer @-@ term tracking , or even <unk> , or <unk> @-@ <unk> , or <unk> @-@ <unk> , to <unk> families to prove to victims , to her children , children are often asked to fight the family &apos;s time to spend a time with the men that their mother .
now we still ask , why don &apos;t she flee ?
and I decided to leave because of the last brutal beating that I could afford .
I realized that if I didn &apos;t resist , this man that I used to love kills me .
so I broke my silence .
I went to everybody : the police , my friend and family , totally strange people , and I could stand here today because everybody helped me .
we tend to define victims as <unk> , <unk> women , like the worst title of journalism .
&quot; why is she leaving ? &quot;
some of you are actually saying , &quot; This is her wrong , &quot; as if the victim is intentionally and intended to die from the men in love .
but after the book , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; a lot of men and women have told me their stories , and they want to tell people that they &apos;re going to learn from what &apos;s going on , they &apos;re going to start to live their lives -- happy lives -- their wives , their mothers , their mothers , their lives .
in fact , I &apos;m a classic domestic warrior , which is a typical domestic warrior .
I married a very <unk> man again with three children .
he built a black <unk> , he opened the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and I &apos;m never going to have it again , always a mouth that says love is a gun @-@ <unk> gun that focuses on my head .
now , you may be thinking , wow , that &apos;s amazing , or , &quot; Oh , she &apos;s cool , &quot; but in the process , I &apos;m talking about you .
I &apos;m sure there are people who are now listening to me who are now abused or abused when they &apos;re a kid or you &apos;re a <unk> .
abuse may happen to your daughter , happens to you in your sister , your best friend .
I can end up with my crazy love story of ending my own silence .
I &apos;m still losing my silence today .
it &apos;s the way I help other victims , and I have the last request for you .
tell people what you &apos;re hearing today .
abuse can only live in silence .
you have the power to stop the abuse and get the power to light up .
we need every single individual to help .
we need every one of you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
and your kids , your colleagues , your friends and family , discuss this topic that will abuse light and abuse .
help survivor reclaim the best , lovely self , <unk> the future .
finding the cure for domestic violence and taking care of the potential of what &apos;s going on , providing the cure for the victims .
let &apos;s face it , let &apos;s get our bed , our dining room and our family into a safe , peaceful oasis .
thank you .
when I was a kid , I thought my country was the best in the world , and I learned a song called <unk> .
I feel very proud .
we spend a lot of time learning history in schools , but we have never learned a lot about the world outside , except for America , Korea , Japan .
and while I was thinking about the outside world , I thought I would spend my life in North Korea until all of the things changed .
when I was seven years old , I witnessed the first public execution , but I thought I was living in North Korea .
my family is not poor . and for myself , I &apos;ve never experienced starvation .
but one day in 1995 , my mother brought home a letter from her colleague .
it says , &quot; When you read this , all five of my five people are going to leave , because we haven &apos;t been eating for two weeks .
we &apos;re all lying on the floor right now , and our bodies are so <unk> and ready to die . &quot;
I was shocked .
that was the first time I heard that people in my country were in .
and very soon , when I was walking through a train , I saw a very painful thing that made me laugh .
a dying woman is lying on the ground , holding a sick child , and that kid can be despairing face of his mother &apos;s face .
but nobody helped them , because you couldn &apos;t help their families and their families .
in the early &apos; 90s , North Korea had a terrible famine .
unfortunately , over a million North Koreans died in famine , and a lot of the survivors were to eat <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
the power is getting more and more and more and more and more frequently , at night , everything around me becomes almost pitch black , and whatever it is to pass through my house .
I think about why they have fireworks , and we don &apos;t .
this is a satellite map of the night sky and compare North Korea to North Korea .
this is <unk> , as part of China and North Korea .
and as you can see , this river is very narrow , and it &apos;s very narrow , and it can be accessible to China .
but a lot of people tried to die .
sometimes I see the body in the water .
I can &apos;t disclose all the details that I &apos;ve left in North Korea , but I can only say that the most difficult years in famine , I &apos;ve been brought to China and relatives .
I thought , I was just separated from my family for a very short time .
but I never thought about it , and I was there for 14 years .
in China , I was struggling as a young girl .
I don &apos;t know , as a refugee from North Korea , how my future life would be , but I quickly realized that it was difficult not only to live , but it was dangerous , because North Korea was seen as illegal immigrants in China .
so I was always in fear , and I was scared of my identity , and I was sent back to North Korea , and I was given the tragic fate .
one day , my worst nightmare became real , and I was grabbed by the Chinese police , and I was taken to the police department for an act .
I was an officer of North America , so the cop tested my Mandarin skills , and asked me a lot of questions .
and I was very scared , and I was feeling my heart blown away by fear .
if I had any money , I would go to prison and send it back .
I thought I &apos;d finished my life , and still trying to hide my own fears and panic and answer their questions .
after that , a cop says to another person , &quot; paper is wrong .
she &apos;s not North Koreans . &quot;
and they left me . it was a miracle .
some North Koreans were seeking asylum in China to go to the foreign embassy , but a lot of people were arrested by the Chinese police , sent back to North Korea .
these girls are lucky .
even though they were caught , the great international <unk> , they were released .
but a few North Koreans did not get so lucky .
every year , tens of thousands of North Koreans were arrested in China and they were sent back to North Korea , and they were <unk> , or they were being executed .
although I was lucky enough to leave North Korea , a lot of my people didn &apos;t have that good fortune .
it &apos;s a very tragic fact , and that is that North Koreans have to be <unk> , so hard to survive .
even though they &apos;ve learned to read Chinese , they &apos;ve found jobs , their whole world is fundamentally <unk> .
and that &apos;s why , after 10 years in <unk> , I decided to take the risk to Korea , and then I started a new life .
it was a little more difficult than I &apos;d ever imagined , and it was challenging .
English is so important in Korea , so I have to start learning the third language -- English .
and I realized there was a huge difference between Korea and North Korea .
we &apos;re all alone , but our internal combustion has become very different , since the year of 67 years .
I &apos;ve even experienced self @-@ concern .
am I Korean or North Koreans ?
where do I come from ? who am I ?
and all of a sudden , I don &apos;t seem to call any country my own country .
and while my life was adaptive , I decided to do it .
it &apos;s about university education .
and just recently , I got a fascinating phone call .
the CDC has taken away a part of my home , where my family is forced , moved to a remote place .
they have to run away , so I started to help them escape .
North America &apos;s road is so <unk> .
it &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border with Korea , so it &apos;s ironic that I flew in China and then to go to the border .
because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , I had to help them move through the <unk> , into Southeast Asia .
we had a week on the bus , and a couple of days were almost caught .
again , we &apos;re sitting in a bus , and a Chinese officer has a car .
he looked at every individual ID card , and he started asking the questions .
because my family doesn &apos;t know Chinese , I &apos;m scared they &apos;re going to get caught .
so when the Chinese officer quickly <unk> to my house , I instinctively tell him how many of these were self @-@ fulfilling , and I was their curator .
he suspected looking at me , but the luck he believed me .
so we went all the way to the <unk> , but I was going to spend almost all the light on the edge of the foreign police .
and even though we &apos;ve been in denial , my family was arrested for illegal launch .
after I gave the fine and the bribe , my family was released a month , but very soon , they were caught in the capital of the People , and they were arrested .
that was one of the lowest moments in my life .
I was trying to get my family free , and I was able to get my job right when it was near freezing , and the family was going to go through a prison , and it wasn &apos;t very far from North Korea .
I &apos;ve been <unk> and police department for dozens of times , desperately trying to get them out , but I don &apos;t have enough money to pay for the bribe or the fine .
I can &apos;t help .
and at that point , I heard a guy asking me , &quot; How ? &quot;
and I was amazed , a complete stranger , asked .
I have a really bad English , and I &apos;m going to explain it to the person , and the guy is going to go to the ATMs , and the other two North Koreans have paid all the bills that they have left .
I really loved him and said , &quot; Why are you going to help me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m the people in North Korea . &quot;
I realized it was a symbolic moment in my life .
the good man stood for me and the North Koreans , and he allowed me to understand that the well @-@ being of strangers and international support is a light that we need North Koreans .
and eventually , after a long trip , I and my family finally arrived in South Korea , but only half of the freedom to die .
a lot of North America separated from their families , and when they come to new countries , they usually have very little money , or <unk> .
so we can train education , English training , training , whatever .
we can also bridge the gap between the people that live in the world and the people that live in North Korea , because a lot of us live in love with families in North Korea , and the information and the money that we &apos;re going to go back and change North Korea .
and I was so lucky that I got so much help and revelation in my life , so I wanted to help the North Koreans , in the international aid , an opportunity to make a dream .
I &apos;m confident that you &apos;re going to see increasing North Koreans in the world , including TED .
thank you .
now , you might agree on that road probably well .
it &apos;s made of the asphalt , the tar is a very good material , driving it very well , but not always , particularly like this day , when it rains .
it &apos;s <unk> out a lot of water .
and especially if you &apos;re riding a bicycle along the way , it &apos;s not good .
at the same time , the Argentine government produce a lot of noise .
the material is kind of noisy , and if we &apos;re going to build the <unk> cities , like the Dutch road , we &apos;re going to want a small noise .
the way to solve it is by using the <unk> of the asphalt .
it &apos;s porous , and it &apos;s used in most of the highways , it &apos;s a little compound that allows the water to flow next to the road , and the road is easy , and no <unk> .
the noise disappears in these pores .
because it has a lot of empty , it <unk> the noise , so the road is silent .
of course , it &apos;s got holes , and the downside of this road is that the asphalt might be <unk> .
what is a <unk> ? look at the rock falls on the road .
start a piece , then it becomes more and more -- I won &apos;t demonstrate .
but they &apos;re going to damage your windshield ; you &apos;re not happy .
and finally , this kind of bouncy brings more and more .
sometimes the road is available .
no , he was ready .
it &apos;s going to be a problem , but we have a solution .
and here you see the impact on this material .
this is the tar , as I said , that there are little <unk> in the middle .
because of the <unk> , the reason for ultraviolet , or for the reason , this kind of pepper , which is a narrow <unk> between the Sun , goes off , and if it starts to contract , it starts to <unk> .
if you &apos;re on that path , you &apos;re going to be looking for these <unk> -- that &apos;s what we see .
in order to solve this problem , we &apos;re considering self @-@ cleaning materials .
if we can make this material self @-@ repair , we can have a solution .
what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re using clean steel , high @-@ steel , high @-@ steel , high @-@ steel , high @-@ steel , small , tiny little , tiny little , little <unk> , small , little <unk> .
so now the asphalt has some <unk> in it .
you need a machine like this , an <unk> motor -- it can cook for it .
sensing can be heated , especially if you want to heat the ball .
so what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to heat the steel , melt it , melt it out of those little cracks , and then dropping out of those little cracks , and get stuck .
because the sensing is too big , I &apos;m showing up here with the <unk> .
the same principle of <unk> <unk> .
I put it in , and I &apos;m going to take it and see what happens .
this is what a sample looks like today .
we have four and a half million machines in our lab to heat the samples .
we tested a lot of samples , and the government saw our results , and they decided , &quot; This is interesting , we should try . &quot;
the government allowed us to do a four @-@ meter distance by <unk> , where we made materials tests .
and that &apos;s what we did . what you see here is a street experimenting , and of course that road is not going to be bad in recent years , and we confirmed that .
we took a lot of samples in the lab .
we did aging experiments , and we added a lot of <unk> to heat them up , heating and testing .
we can do that .
in fact , the conclusion that this experiment came out was that if we had each four years to heat the machines -- the <unk> , the <unk> , we would have to move this machine to the road -- we would double the road , of course , every four years .
so , the conclusion is that we &apos;ve created a material that we can use , and we &apos;ve added <unk> to the flow of energy , to increase the pace of life on the road , to allow the duration of the road to a very simple technique .
you wonder whether it works .
we &apos;re looking at this prototype . it &apos;s hot .
in fact , I &apos;m going to let it cool down first to show you whether heated works .
but try it out .
see , it &apos;s true , it &apos;s built .
thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
there are four million birds on Earth .
<unk> is one of the most endangered species in them .
every time you look at <unk> like this , it starts to emerge in your mind that this is some <unk> , some <unk> , some horrible creatures that are trying to emerge from politicians .
I want to change that perspective . I want to change the way you think about <unk> , because they need our compassion . they really need it .
let me tell you why .
first of all , why do they leave us alone ?
Charles Darwin sailed on the train of the Atlantic Ocean in 1775 , and he was saying , &quot; These <unk> , far @-@ fetched birds that were always remaining in the mud . &quot;
it &apos;s very hard to find a benign violation that Charles Darwin said .
you know , Darwin went back and changed his perspective , and I &apos;ll tell you why .
<unk> was once looked at -- like a <unk> , <unk> , personality -- becomes a <unk> , stupid character .
and recently , if you look at the news in Kenya -- the Kenyan MPs were amazed at the <unk> and the <unk> , but I want to do something about it .
I want to question it . you know why ?
because members can &apos;t keep the natural clean .
you cannot prevent the spread of disease .
almost no one &apos;s going to follow every day .
they &apos;re very far away from the extinct .
and this is my favorite , <unk> @-@ <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> in the world .
the New York Times is mostly growing in the Americas , like the <unk> and Venezuela , and in other continents , there are about 16 million trees in it , and they have a risk of extinction .
so why is it important ? well , first of all , the ecological cycles are essential . they are poor .
<unk> is our natural waste .
they would eat the meat of the body , and they would have a <unk> .
they can eliminate all the bacteria on the bodies , and they can absorb the spread of the virus to prevent the spread of the virus and the animals and the disease .
the recent study shows that in places where the dead , dead bodies are three to four times more distant , and that provides a lot more opportunities for the epidemic .
and there &apos;s a lot of historical history .
they are closely related to ancient Egyptians .
<unk> is a cultural symbol of <unk> and <unk> in ancient Egypt , and it &apos;s often <unk> with the <unk> goddess of <unk> and blues .
in the mythology of the Hindu myth , <unk> <unk> <unk> , he took his life from 10 evil spirits to the right <unk> .
in Tibet culture , <unk> and <unk> are incredibly important in places like Tibet , where there are no conditions , no wood , no wood , so the <unk> are providing a natural process for the locals .
so what are the problems ?
Kenya grows with eight <unk> , and six of them are dying .
many of the reasons why they were <unk> , toxins , because in Kenya , human and wildlife are fighting over time , and they use poison and they use poison to treat animals , and the animal is turned into the next victim .
in South Asia , some states look like India and Pakistan , and these four <unk> are widely endangered , which means that in 10 to 15 years or 15 years they &apos;re going to go extinct , because <unk> has been fed to genetically <unk> by natural selection .
now there are <unk> acids in India , which have been banned in India , and the government has made a positive tone .
because wild dogs and wild dogs , wild dogs , have been wild cats around them , wild wild dogs and wild dogs , and they &apos;re like a ticking away every once a time period , and the number of cases in India has tremendous growth .
Kenya is going to have the largest wind power plant in Africa : the wind power lines are going to be installed in the <unk> zone .
I &apos;m not against wind development , but we should be asking the government to rethink the decision , because the wind will threat the birds , and the high @-@ speed will split the bird in half .
they &apos;re just birds .
in West Africa , some people don &apos;t have compassion , they have the right to meet the needs of <unk> and <unk> .
what are we doing ? we &apos;re working on these <unk> , we &apos;re putting <unk> on them .
we &apos;re trying to figure out what the relationship is and what &apos;s going on with the environment .
we find them travel between different countries , so if you &apos;re just looking at one area , you &apos;re very hard to make progress .
we need to work with governments throughout the area .
we &apos;re trying to communicate with local residents .
we &apos;re trying to get them to the good , to appreciate the benefits of these wonderful creatures and the consequences of nature .
what can you do ? you can act , make <unk> , you can write your government and tell them , we need to look at these awful creatures , and just take a moment to tell you how many people around you .
when you get out of this room , you &apos;re <unk> , not only to tell your family , but to tell your neighbor about their neighbors .
they were so elegantly . Charles Darwin once said that he had changed his perspective , and he saw that the <unk> were in the air , and he built it back .
Kenya , all around the world , will have a big loss if you lose all these wonderful species .
thank you very much .
people around us can help us make our lives a better place .
we don &apos;t necessarily have to meet our neighbors all the time , so even if we live in a public space , our neighbors are not allowed to be transferred .
so in the last few years , I &apos;ve tried to give a bunch of stickers , different ones , and these simple tools to share more in public space .
these projects came from some of my own questions : how much would my neighbor rent ?
how can we get from the neighborhood to the rest of the world and prevent the tower from playing the next door ?
how can we share our own memories about being destroyed and better understanding the land that we live in ?
how do we express the expectations that we see in the snow that will allow our community to reflect our needs and dreams ?
I live in New Orleans and fell in love with this city .
the giant trees of the brave trees can touch my soul for hundreds of years , of couples , of <unk> and <unk> , and people have always believed that a city full of music .
every time someone got a sneeze , I felt that New Orleans had come to a march .
New Orleans had many of the most beautiful buildings in the world , but at the same time , she was the most <unk> city in the United States .
I live near this building , and I wanted to make it a better place for me to think about it , and it changed my life .
in 2009 , I lost a person I loved .
her name was <unk> , and for me , she was like my mother , and she died suddenly , and no one was predicting .
and I thought about a lot of things about death , and - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
but I was very hard to maintain this mentality in my life .
I think it &apos;s easy for people to be trapped in all day @-@ to @-@ day <unk> to forget what matters .
so I worked with some remarkable help to bring this wall into a big , big panel that I &apos;d put up on the top and say , &quot; Before death , I thought ... &quot; so every one of these people would pick up a piece of chalk and share their lives in a public fashion and share their desire .
I don &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , the whole wall is filled and people add new answers .
I want to share with you some of the things people are doing on the wall .
&quot; before I die , I want to be a review for my release . &quot;
&quot; before the death , I want to cross the hall . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to sing in front of millions of viewers . &quot;
&quot; before the death , a tree . &quot;
&quot; before the death , I wanted to live a brick . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to hold her again . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to be a guy . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to be absolutely true . &quot;
this building that was supposed to be missing was a very constructive place where these people wanted and dreams made me laugh , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and gave me comfort .
it makes us believe that we are not alone .
let &apos;s take a new view of the neighbors .
and this allows us to create a space of reflection and thinking , and to tell us what is important in the process of changing .
this is what I did last year , and I got some passionate information about people who wanted to build a wall in their community , and so my colleague and I made a small toolbox that now includes South Africa , Australia , Australia , Australia , and so on .
it turns out that if we can have an expressive will and share it with others , then public space will play a huge role .
the most precious thing that we have is a time and a link to other people .
in the age of this visionary life , trying to maintain itself , to remember the fragility of life becomes more important than ever .
we &apos;re always talking about dying and dying and thinking about dying , but I realized that being dead is one of the most powerful things we can do .
thinking about death can make you more conscious of your life .
public space can be much better at recognizing what is really important to us , whether it &apos;s true to individuals , or for the whole community , to share our hopes , our fears , our experiences and our experiences , not only to help us create a better place for our lives .
thank you .
thank you .
I was in a mines that was 50 meters deep in Ghana .
the air is hot , it &apos;s filled with dust , it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I can feel the warmth of the mop out of me , but I can &apos;t see anything else .
I &apos;m hearing people talking about their voices , but I &apos;m talking about them with a <unk> , <unk> , silent rock .
and like everybody else , I had this little <unk> with a <unk> <unk> knife tied up with a broken face , and I <unk> up the stairs and felt the harbor of the wall , and they held this meter of water , and they held this meter of water .
my hand slide up , and immediately , a miner who happened to a miner who had his hand dropped out of the stairs .
when I stand here today with you today , these miner who are still in mines like this , where they &apos;re working , no pay , no pay , no money , no <unk> .
I finally climbed out of mines and I was able to get home , and the miner who was the son of slavery could never come home .
for the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been filming dozens of dozens of countries across the planet , and in 2009 , I &apos;m very honored to be at the Vancouver pace of independence , in Vancouver .
and I met a lot of really amazing people there , and I learned about the liberation of the Free <unk> , which was to eradicate modern society .
we talked about slavery , and at this point I started to understand how slavery was , but I didn &apos;t know what the hell was going on .
and at the end of our conversation , I felt really bad , and I felt ashamed of this violation , which I don &apos;t know , how many people do not know ?
and this idea made me die , and a few weeks later , I flew to Los Angeles to see the head of the FreeSpeech <unk> , and I wanted to make a difference .
and that led me to a voyage into contemporary art .
strangely , I &apos;ve been there .
I &apos;ve got them as my second home .
but this time , I &apos;m going to find the secret of the light that &apos;s not going to be possible .
it &apos;s been estimated that 27 million people around the world today are slavery .
this number is twice the number of <unk> trade in the Atlantic Ocean in Africa .
and 150 years ago , a high @-@ cost business in the United States is worth three times as much as a whole .
that &apos;s about 50,000 dollars today .
but today , the cost of a whole family was slavery could be only 18 dollars .
what was striking about it was that the global profit produced over 1.3 billion dollars a year .
many of them have been rendered as false commitment to the <unk> , to the so @-@ called educational opportunities , to work free for free to escape violence and to escape .
today slavery is about commercial oil , and it &apos;s about the value of creating goods that are made by individuals .
it &apos;s almost every corner of the world , even though it &apos;s illegal everywhere .
in India and Nepal , I was brought to Chau Doc .
it was a very weird sight there , like going into the ancient Greek or the <unk> of hell .
men , women , men , women , children , in fact , the whole family is packed with thick dust so that the building can reach its head up to 18 blocks every day and then reach a few hundred kilometers away .
<unk> and tired , hanging on with them , screaming , doing the same thing over and over and over again , 16 to 17 hours a day .
you can &apos;t rest , you can &apos;t eat , you can &apos;t drink it because of extreme water , they basically don &apos;t have to have a toilet .
it was too hot for the <unk> and dust , and my camera was so hot that it couldn &apos;t work .
every 20 minutes , I have to go back to my car , clean my device , put it in the air @-@ conditioning , and it blows my breath away , and when the camera is eaten , it &apos;s better than those living people .
and I went back to Chau Doc , and I wanted to cry , but the <unk> theorem , and he said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t cry here . &quot;
and he explained to me that in this place , it was very dangerous , not only for me , but for these workers .
I couldn &apos;t get them any direct help .
I can &apos;t give them money . I can &apos;t give them anything .
I &apos;m not the citizen of that country .
my behavior is probably going to make them worse than it is now .
I was expecting the Free <unk> to be able to work within the operating system , to allow them to do that .
for me , I have to wait for my family to feel my pain .
and at the same time , I saw a kid in the Himalayas , with a rock and a couple of miles up to the side of the road waiting for a truck .
the kids with the <unk> , the kids with the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> clothes , the <unk> , the <unk> .
it &apos;s an extraordinarily painful thing to witness .
how can we intervene in these hidden spheres , but are there universal religious benefits ?
some people don &apos;t even think they &apos;re going to be a slave of slavery every day because they &apos;re born for that .
no comparison .
if they were to fight the people , they would burn all their houses .
these people have nothing to do with it , they want to give up , but in the middle of the picture , the woman is bringing the <unk> of the mountain to the local <unk> , so they &apos;re going to keep on doing the same thing , but now they &apos;re doing it for themselves , and they &apos;re now getting free for free .
and the reason why we &apos;re talking about slavery is that we &apos;re often talking about slavery , because you know , I was asked to say , if I keep on filming , it &apos;s not going to be safe .
at the end of the year , I was raised by women who had always been there .
they took me down the narrow stairs and they walked into a filthy basement .
it &apos;s not a <unk> .
it &apos;s more like a restaurant .
the balconies are used to be used to drink prostitution in Chinese restaurants .
in little booth , <unk> women and children , there are only seven @-@ year @-@ olds that give them more food and wine .
each of these little cubicle is very dirty , and the walls are drawn from the curtains and curtains .
the people who work here tend to abuse , they tend to abuse their <unk> .
remember , I was standing almost in the dark , and I was struck by the moment that I was trying to get stuck in this hell .
there &apos;s only one <unk> : that &apos;s the staircase .
there was no <unk> .
there &apos;s no window at all .
these people are completely unable to escape , and when we &apos;re faced with such difficult issues , it &apos;s important to know about slavery , including the <unk> <unk> in our backyard .
tens of thousands of restaurants , thousands of homes , hundreds of thousands of homes , have not only .
recently , the New York Times ran about 100,000 to 300,000 children every year , being bought as <unk> .
it &apos;s all around us , and we just don &apos;t know that .
it &apos;s also something that we hear about slavery all the time .
I visited a village in India , the silk trade .
this is a picture of the whole family .
the hand that was <unk> , the father of the blue and the red hand belongs to two sons .
they &apos;re putting in the <unk> , they &apos;re putting the silk , and then they &apos;re stuck inside , until the thermo @-@ bimetal is all liquid .
the translator told me their story .
&quot; we don &apos;t have freedom . they say .
&quot; but we still hope , and God can escape this room for other places where work can be paid . &quot;
it &apos;s been estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the <unk> Lake Turkana in slavery in the world .
we were there , and I was going to see a little bit about it .
I see it seems like a whole family fishing on the ship , two older brother , a few little dots , is it ?
wrong ! they &apos;re all slaves .
the children were taken from their homes , they were forced to work on the boat , they were not going to swim .
this little boy is eight years old .
when our boat gets close , he <unk> our canoe , hits his canoe .
he was scared to fall in the water .
he rides the tracks some trees , and he often lives in the net , and the kids who are tired are dropping in the water to untie the net .
a lot of people are drowning .
it &apos;s been forced to work at the beginning of his life .
he was scared of the master , and he was scared that he was going to run away because he was treated with the same <unk> that he had with his little slaves .
I saw these boys at 5 a.m. in the morning working at the end of the net , and they started working in one morning .
it was so cold , it was very windy night .
you have to know that the net is full of fish .
I want to introduce you to the <unk> .
he was raised from a fishing village , a fishing village .
he saw that he was in a hospital , and the &quot; <unk> &quot; worked for the victims of slavery .
he &apos;s in a photograph , and he &apos;s in a <unk> , and the good news is that right now , the family is much more prepared , and they &apos;re ready to make a living and make sure that kids are safe .
it &apos;s a possible possibility .
because someone showed up , it affected his life , and it could change the future .
driving a road in Ghana , with a partner with the FreeSpeech <unk> , a handheld van that suddenly leaps up into our car and hits our window .
he made a decision to go out and make a decision to the forest .
at the end of the road , he urged us to get out of the car .
and he pointed to a series of very obvious footprints , and he said , &quot; Yes , here &apos;s the road . go ! &quot;
we &apos;ve got a pretty good <unk> of fresh water for about an hour , and I &apos;ve got a recent shot of the water on the top of my head and continuing to carry on going from above .
two hours later , <unk> <unk> , we had a big <unk> in front of us , and every one of them had a big <unk> , and every one of them had a slave to work .
a lot of women are still carrying their own little , and they &apos;re walking in the midst of oil with mercury .
mercury is used for gold .
these people were in slavery in other mines in Ghana .
when they &apos;re out of the mine , they &apos;re all out of the mines .
I remember that they were tired of having 72 hours of their eyes , and many of them were already working for 72 hours .
these rocks are about 90 feet deep , and they &apos;re filled with bags full of <unk> , and these rocks are sprayed in the other area , and they &apos;re archived for gold .
it &apos;s not good enough to crash , but we &apos;ve managed to find some people who are at the edges and some young children .
they were victims of violent violence .
in fact , these muscles are robust , and a few years later , possibly like this guy , <unk> and tuberculosis .
this is <unk> . when his father died , his uncle sold him to the mines that he was working on .
and when his uncle died , his uncle had to carry on with his uncle , and he was forced to work on the mines .
I met him who had been working on a frame for 14 years , and the man who saw it in the midst of an accident that had been created at the time of an accident , and the doctor said he had an amputation .
in addition to this particular one , he had tuberculosis , and even so , he had to work every day .
even though , he also had his dream to be able to recreate free in the FreeSpeech , the help of education in education was this belief that was unthinkable .
I want us to give these people a sense of slavery .
when I was filming , I took a lot of candles , I placed them in translation , I gave them the photographs of objects that I wish I could light their stories and their difficulties , and when we were all safety , I made a series of photographs .
they know it &apos;s going to be seen by people outside .
I want them to know that we &apos;re going to change their lives for the month .
I do believe that when we think of them as human beings , it &apos;s hard to achieve the atrocities .
it &apos;s not about issues , it &apos;s about people , and it &apos;s about people , and it &apos;s about people , and it &apos;s about you , and it &apos;s about dignity and respect .
I don &apos;t want these beautiful , but I was surrounded by people I could not meet .
I want these images to be able to evoke a powerful force in your eye , and I hope that the force of that will be the light of slavery to be the light of the viewer , because without the light that will live in a shadow .
thank you .
now , I &apos;m an application of mathematics , and for every one of the people who apply mathematics , it &apos;s a very specific problem that we have with management consultants .
nobody knows what we are doing .
so I &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we do today .
well , dance is one of the many activities of humanity .
we &apos;re feeling like a <unk> and a dance <unk> , and you &apos;re going to know that later .
now ballet needs extraordinary expertise and remarkable professional skills , and even a basic level of intelligence .
but sadly , the nervous system disease , like Parkinson &apos;s disease , <unk> the ability to <unk> this remarkable thing , is that he was a <unk> at the age of a <unk> .
he &apos;s been undergoing a lot of therapy for these years .
however , there are <unk> million people in the world who are affected by this disease , and they have to endure , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , we need to use objective tools to test them before they can .
we need objective measurements , and we want to know when , at the end , the only way to get a cure is when we have an objective reality .
but the stigma is Parkinson &apos;s , and the other <unk> disease , there &apos;s no <unk> , so you can &apos;t do simple blood tests , and the best thing we can do is , like a 20 @-@ minute neuroscience test .
you have to get a clinic , and it &apos;s expensive , which means that , outside of clinical trials , nobody has ever done this before .
but what if the patient could do this at home ?
this could also be the vehicle for the patient , the vehicle for the clinic , if the patient can complete the test itself ?
you don &apos;t need a lot of money to hire employees .
by the way , if you go to a neurologist , this is about 300 dollars .
so I &apos;d like to propose an unusual approach to you , a way that we can try to get there , because you know , at least we are like my friend <unk> .
I have a video about <unk> <unk> .
this is a healthy state , and somebody is saying , we think of ourselves as the voice of sound , because when we &apos;re making sound , we have to adjust these <unk> , we &apos;re born with artificial genes , like <unk> .
and also , like ballet , it takes a very specific training .
think about it . how long would it take for a child ?
and from the sound , we can follow the position of the <unk> , where the Parkinson &apos;s disease can impact us , and it can impact us .
you can see that the bottom line is a kind of <unk> trajectory .
we see the same symptoms .
voices , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
speech is <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and so forth , and these are symptoms .
in fact , the sound of the sound is so unpredictable , but as long as you have a digital video clip of software that you can now use today &apos;s newest machine research , we can now be at the cusp of other people &apos;s health and disease in a straight line that just requires speech signals .
so these results are based on speech @-@ based testing , how do they go together with professional clinical trials , and they &apos;re all <unk> technology .
neuroscience testing is <unk> , and they use existing infrastructure .
you don &apos;t have to design a series of new hospitals to test it .
they &apos;re all <unk> . they &apos;re all based on speech tests , but they &apos;re not experts at all .
that means you can get your hands out .
it &apos;s fast , and it &apos;s just 30 seconds .
the price is low , and we know how to do it .
it can be expanded at large scale .
I have some of the great goals that I have here .
we can reduce the number of questions with patients .
it &apos;s not necessary to go to the clinic and do the mundane tests .
we can monitor objective data using high @-@ fidelity .
we &apos;re very low @-@ tech and very low @-@ cost testing , and we can show how many people scale up in the first time .
we also have the opportunity to look for this disease in the early days of life .
so , from the beginning of this direction today , we started the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> project .
together with <unk> <unk> , we want to document enough data from around the world to achieve these four goals .
our <unk> number connected to seven million people on Earth .
any health or Parkinson &apos;s disease can come in , it &apos;s cheap , it &apos;s cheap , and I &apos;m happy to report that we &apos;re only going to get six percent in eight hours .
thank you .
Max , based on these samples , you can tell who is healthy , who is the disease ?
what do you want to get out of these samples ?
yeah , yeah . so this is what you have to tell us if you have this kind of illness .
you know , some people may not be calling us , or they &apos;re not attached .
but we &apos;re still going to get a lot of samples from different environments , and the point is different environments , because we can eliminate the phenomenon of these <unk> and apply them to real @-@ life markers .
so what about 86 percent accuracy ?
it &apos;s far more than that .
in fact , my student <unk> , I &apos;ll mention him because he made some remarkable outcomes , and he &apos;s now proof that the mobile phone can be done online , so now we &apos;re approaching 99 percent accuracy .
now , that &apos;s pretty cool .
so that means that people can -- -- people can use their phones , get in your phone , and then do this test , and then they can play the phone , and then they can record the sound , and then they can check what they &apos;re going to do in that particular phase of the disease .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much . gorgeous .
thank you .
I &apos;ve always been fascinated by photography since I &apos;ve been long enough , but I &apos;d like to share with you 15 images that I &apos;m most passionate about , and they &apos;re not a photograph I &apos;ve ever made .
no artistic director , no <unk> , no <unk> opportunity , not to mention .
in fact , most of them are accidental visitors .
my story was <unk> at a time when I was a Spanish <unk> , my wife , and I was wearing a picture of my daughter that day her first birthday , and we were standing on the Champs @-@ Elysees and 15th .
and a year later , we went back to New York City , so we decided to take the same picture .
you can guess how things work .
when my daughter was three years old , her wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you ever want to go back to New York ? do you have this little tradition ? &quot;
and that &apos;s when we started looking for visitors .
you know , putting a camera to a complete stranger &apos;s photograph is something unusual and unusual .
no one &apos;s going to say no , no one &apos;s going to take our camera down .
at that time , we didn &apos;t know it would change our lives deeply .
it became sacred to us .
this was taken a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and I tried to explain what was going on the day of 9 / 11 , trying to get this five @-@ year @-@ old way of knowing .
so these photos are far more than just documenting a moment , or a very particular journey .
these are the way we remember the last week of the 10 months , to remember the day , and how we changed year after year , not just the change in our bodies , but the changes in our bodies .
because I photographed the same photographs every year , and our eyes were different , and the daughter was coming to a new milestone , and I looked at life through her eyes and looked at everything .
it &apos;s time for us to spend a lot of time , and it &apos;s the most anticipated year .
and recently , we were walking down , and she suddenly stopped , and she pointed to a red <unk> that she was very happy when she was a little girl , and she began our journey .
she said to me five years old , and she was standing on that picture .
she said that she remembers the first time she saw her heart emerging , it was nine years ago .
now she goes to New York City on a college campus because she decided to go to New York City .
and I suddenly understood that one of the things that we created was our memories .
so I want to share this active and conscious thinking about creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but I personally , besides these 15 photographs , I won &apos;t be in family photographs .
I &apos;m always the guy with the camera .
I &apos;d like to encourage all of you in this room to get to the picture , don &apos;t you know , go up to the front lines , go up to the front , &quot; can you take a picture ? &quot;
thank you .
