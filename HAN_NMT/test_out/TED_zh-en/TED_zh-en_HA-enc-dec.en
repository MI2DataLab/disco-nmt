and one day , the Los Angeles Times , Steve <unk> on the Los Angeles Times , heard a wonderful piece .
music was written by a man , an African @-@ American man , a pretty charming man , and a <unk> and only played two strings .
and I &apos;m going to tell you a lot of you now know that since Steve &apos;s column turned out to be a book @-@ based , and then Robert <unk> , who happened to be a movie theater for Nathaniel , who was a double double <unk> on the <unk> School of music for his career as well as a result of <unk> <unk> .
Nathaniel had just dropped out from the Juilliard music music music , and after 30 years , he was homeless on the streets of Los Angeles on the roadside .
I encourage all of you to go to the book of Steve , or look at the movies , not just to understand the beauty of these two men and women , but to see music as being the most useful tool to create this kind of ties , and that was the most useful tools that changed Nathaniel &apos;s life .
I met sir and Mr. <unk> , in 2008 , two years ago at the Disney concert .
he listened to Beethoven number one , and the fourth symphony came upon himself .
and he was talking a little bit of a <unk> , and he was talking about <unk> and Hillary Clinton , because of the last Beethoven &apos;s fourth orchestra , the performance of the violin played in the world .
we talked a little bit about music . and a few days later , I got Steve letters from Nathaniel who was interested in playing with me the violin .
and what I should mention is that Nathaniel refused treatment , because what he was given was the <unk> and the <unk> and the scars that stayed in his life .
and as a result , his schizophrenia now became even more direct , and the worst presentation is that he disappeared a few days later on the streets on the <unk> , exposed to the <unk> of the mentally and suffering .
Nathaniel was a state in which we started in the Disney Hall hall for the first grade in his eyes , in which he was a lost direction .
he mentioned the invisible devil and the smoke , and how someone was crying when he was asleep .
I was scared not to worry about my own security , but to fear that I would lose him again and again to one of his states , and I would destroy his relationship to a violin , and if I started talking about <unk> and other forms of violin and other forms of music .
so I started <unk> .
I played the first <unk> of Beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
when I was playing , I knew there was a change in Nathaniel &apos;s eye .
it &apos;s as if he grabbed something that was invisible , it was a chemical chemistry , and that was the catalyst for it .
his voice is <unk> , and it &apos;s transformed into quiet curiosity and elegance .
and the magic is , he picks up his violin , and he starts playing with some of the pieces of <unk> , and then he &apos;s going to do it again , and he &apos;s going to do it again .
so we started talking about music : from Bach to Beethoven , <unk> , all of the names started with B.
and I learned that he wasn &apos;t just a piece of music , but he was able to connect the music with him .
he talked about the passion and the deep understanding of music as I was talking to the colleagues in Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra .
by playing music , talking about music , this man , a <unk> and a <unk> while ago in the Los Angeles Street Journal became a fabulous musician , wonderful music music music music music music music music and music .
music is medicine . music changes us .
music , for the deaf , is about helping him open up .
because music can give him the impression of his imagination and creativity .
and that &apos;s what helped him out of his suffering .
and I know that &apos;s what art looks like .
and that &apos;s the reason why we create music , is that we have an inherent sense that each of us has our most fundamental core of all of us , our emotions , our emotions , our experiences , our creativity , and shape our emotions in reality .
and this real expression of reality has moved us all , inspired us and unity us .
and he took him back to a couple of friends .
the power of music is bringing him back to the whole family of music , where people understand his talents .
and I will always create music for him , whether it &apos;s on the streets of Walt Disney or on the Hudson Street , because he cues me why I &apos;m a musician .
thank you .
Miguel Nicolelis : thank you . thank you .
Robert <unk> .
Robert <unk> : now I &apos;m going to play you a piece of music that I memorized from the <unk> &apos; song .
so please forgive me .
I &apos;ve had a lot of fish in my life .
only two were my favorites .
the first one is passion .
it &apos;s a beautiful fish , a <unk> , texture , a rich fish on the menu .
what a beautiful fish !
and the better thing is , it &apos;s driven by the highest standard raising , which is sustainable .
and the people who sold him were pretty sick .
I had spent a couple of months on this beautiful relationship .
and one day , the top of this company called me and invited me to participate in an event and the development of the fisheries revolution .
and I said , &quot; Well , of course , that &apos;s true . &quot;
this company is trying to solve a problem that we chef can &apos;t imagine , and how do we leave the fish on the menu , the <unk> ?
over the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing from all over the ocean like frozen trees .
it &apos;s not always a disruptive .
ninety percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tunas , the tunas , the <unk> , they &apos;re all extinct .
almost nothing left .
so , whether it &apos;s good or bad or bad , it &apos;s going to be part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of talk about this industry , and actually most of them are about <unk> pollution and efficiency , like tuna . and the biggest fish is the home .
the feed of the tuna is 15 times as much as one .
what that means is , every single pound of a tuna has 15 pounds of feed on other wild fish .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
and it &apos;s not delicious .
and finally , this company wanted to do something right .
I also wanted to support them .
and the day before that event , I contacted the deal of the company &apos;s <unk> .
let &apos;s call him a <unk> for his lunch lady .
and I said , don &apos;t clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear that you &apos;re famous in the ocean , and you &apos;re not going to produce pollution .
and he responding : exactly what you &apos;re talking about . we &apos;re far away from the work , and all of the pollutants that we &apos;ve come from fishing are dilute away , it &apos;s not going to be concentrated in a place .
and then he added it to us , and it &apos;s kind of like an <unk> .
feed the feed ? two and a half times , he said .
the best in the corporate world .
two and a half times better than one .
what &apos;s two and a half ? what are you looking for ?
and he said , &quot; <unk> for sustainability . &quot;
I said , &quot; <unk> are good . &quot; and then the phone comes in .
and as a result of that night , I was lying in bed and wondering what the hell is a living protein ?
so the next day , before that incident , I called clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear Don .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t , you &apos;ve got some examples of sustainable protein ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask the people around .
and then , I had some phone calls with this company , but none of them gave me a clear answer , until finally , they called each other as an expert in biology .
let me tell you about his lady screaming for a second .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t always cut the laundry for a male or two , would you just add a little green for a second to sustainable protein ? &quot;
well , he mentioned a little bit of algae and a little bit of plastic , and he mentioned the following .
and I asked the question : what about <unk> ?
he said , &quot; <unk> are feathers , <unk> , bones , waste , dry and then refrigeration . &quot;
I said , what &apos;s the proportion of the number of chickens in the feed ?
think about it , you know , two percent .
and as a result , he said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s about 30 percent . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear clear away , that &apos;s what sustainability would be ? &quot;
there was silence over the phone for a long time , and he said to me , &quot; The chicken on the world is so much chicken . &quot;
so I no longer love this fish anymore .
no , it wasn &apos;t because I was a self @-@ righteous , righteous man .
and I was like this .
no , I no longer love this fish anymore , because I swear to God that after that dialogue , it became more like a chicken .
the second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s that romantic , the more you know your fish , the more you love it .
the first time I was eating this fish in a restaurant in southern Spain .
a long time ago a journalist and I said this .
she could say it was a <unk> .
that fish lights up on the table with a <unk> , a white light .
chef cooking it for a while .
it was like cooking twice .
but it &apos;s amazing , it &apos;s delicious .
who can make it that way ?
I can &apos;t , but this person can .
let &apos;s call him <unk> . his name is <unk> .
but he didn &apos;t cook that fish , he wasn &apos;t a chef , at least in the way you understand it , he wasn &apos;t .
he was a biologist at the <unk> Hotel .
he &apos;s a <unk> in Spain .
and he was right on the front porch of the river .
it wasn &apos;t until the late 1980s , and it was the basis of the <unk> of Argentina .
they were here at that time , and this was basically wetlands .
and then they pull out the water .
and then they built a series of complex canals , and they put the water on the river .
but they didn &apos;t succeed , I mean economics .
and the conditions around it created tremendous disasters .
almost 90 percent of the birds around the world disappear , and in this part of the bird .
and then in 1982 , a Spanish company that has taken this piece of it .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow .
they were basically <unk> .
instead of <unk> , they used the <unk> to bring water back .
they filled it with water .
and then there was a <unk> acres of fishery -- shrimp , <unk> , <unk> -- in this project , <unk> <unk> , and this company , completely saved this expedition .
and it was phenomenal .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
and I looked at the horizon as a sort of vast , bringing in your view is filled with the channel of water and the wetlands of this magnificent <unk> .
not too long ago , I was there .
he &apos;s a remarkable man , and he &apos;s a Darwinian , a quarter of a crocodile .
we went into the wetlands , and I was <unk> , and I had failed to tell the <unk> about my knees and the <unk> <unk> .
and here , he points to a very rare , black shoulder <unk> .
this is what he referred to as the <unk> plankton .
and this one , he saw a set of patterns that let alone get the giraffe of Tanzania .
and as a result , <unk> had spent a lot of time working in Africa &apos;s <unk> National Park .
I asked him how he became a fish expert .
he said , &quot; <unk> fish ? I don &apos;t know them .
I &apos;m just an expert on <unk> .
and he started talking more about rare birds and algae and different frogs .
please don &apos;t get me wrong , so the conversation really is sort of fascinating , <unk> of things .
that &apos;s good , but I &apos;m in love .
and there was always a catch in my mind that I had forgotten to be a <unk> delicious fish .
so I quit him . I said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , what makes your fish sweet ? &quot;
he pointed to the algae .
as I know , the brothers , the algae , the oxygen , the related things , were amazing .
but what &apos;s your fish eating ?
what &apos;s the feed of cattle ? what about the feed ?
and then he kept telling me that this is a very productive system that the fish were eating in the wild .
plants live in organisms , and phytoplankton , plankton , plankton , all fish feed .
the system is very healthy , it &apos;s completely self @-@ updates .
no feed .
have you heard about a farm that doesn &apos;t feed the animals ?
later on that day , I was driving around with the minister of life , and I asked him , &quot; How does a seemingly natural place , like any other farm that I &apos;ve ever seen , you know , a measure of success ? &quot;
it was then , as if there was a movie director suddenly asking for change .
we turned around to see the most beautiful image , thousands of pink <unk> , which is a pink carpet .
and he said , &quot; That &apos;s success . &quot;
they look at their belly , their pink .
they &apos;re enjoying their <unk> now .
dinner ? I was completely confused .
I said , &quot; Your <unk> , their feast is not your fish ? &quot;
and it was , &quot; He said .
birds will eat 20 percent of our fish and fish .
and last year , this fishery , over 250 different species .
today , this has become one of the largest and most important private birds in Europe .
I said , what about the number of birds , so many bird species , don &apos;t they want to be the ones that don &apos;t want the most ? don &apos;t they want it ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
he said , &quot; We are a general raising , not a verb . &quot;
this is an ecology network .
and then once again , these <unk> are eating shrimp .
shrimp eat <unk> .
so the more bright pink they are , the better the system is .
okay , let &apos;s take a look at it . a farm doesn &apos;t feed it to the animal , and it measured its success based on its natural enemies .
a fishery is also a bird shelter .
and , by the way , those <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t be there .
they breed in the city , and outside 150 miles away , the soil is much more potent .
every morning , they fly 150 miles to this fisheries .
and at night , they flew 150 miles home .
they did this because they could follow the white line on the freeway .
I &apos;m not kidding .
I &apos;ve been thinking about things like &quot; The <unk> <unk> &quot; in my mind , and I &apos;m looking at <unk> .
I said , Lewis <unk> , they fly 150 miles to fisheries , and they fly 150 miles at night ?
do they do it for their kids ? do they do it for their sake ?
and he looked at me like I &apos;d just quote Houston , and he was talking about Houston .
and he said , &quot; Well , they &apos;re not . they &apos;re doing it because it &apos;s better . &quot;
I haven &apos;t mentioned the <unk> of my favorite fish , really delicious , and I usually don &apos;t like baking . I don &apos;t normally like baking . I don &apos;t like <unk> .
it has <unk> , like tar .
I never did it with the fish .
but when I was in the southern part of Spain , it didn &apos;t taste like a <unk> .
it tasted <unk> and it felt like you had a good taste of the nature of the ocean .
and I mentioned to the <unk> of my idea , and he was alone .
and he said , &quot; The effect of the grass is like a sponge . &quot;
it &apos;s the last line of defense that prevents matter from getting into the body .
the effect of it is to absorb the <unk> .
and then he went on and he said , &quot; But we don &apos;t have any water . &quot;
all right . a fish that does not feed it , a fishery measuring its success is due to natural enemies .
and I realized that as he said , a fishery didn &apos;t have any sense , because water flowing through the fisheries is coming from a tall <unk> river .
and that river right now contains all of the stuff that &apos;s in the river , chemical pollutants , in pesticides .
and when it gets to the system , it leaves out , it gets cleaner water than it hits it .
it &apos;s a system of sanitation , and it can filter water from here .
so it &apos;s not just about feeding animals , it &apos;s not just about its success , it &apos;s based on the good health of the natural enemies , but it &apos;s a fishery , and it &apos;s more than just for you and me .
because when water leaves here , it runs into the Atlantic .
I know it &apos;s a very small part of it , but I appreciate it , and you should be , because it &apos;s a love story , not only romance , but it &apos;s education .
you might say it &apos;s the future food diet , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or beef .
what we need now is a new conception of agriculture , a real food .
but for a lot of people , the attendance was down .
we &apos;re not a realist , we &apos;re not a realist . we are love .
we love the market . we love small little farms . we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
and then when you suggest that all this food is going to promise the future of the future , and somebody stands somewhere and says , &quot; Man , I love the pink , but how do you make the world fill up ?
how do you feed the world ? &quot;
can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like your problem .
no , not just because we &apos;ve been producing far more calories than we need in the world .
a billion people today are still in the pit .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- the root of the overall distribution of inequality , not the sum of the forces .
and the reason I don &apos;t like this is because he put up a food system of logic , an logic that existed over the last 50 years .
bring grain to the soil , bring it to the cow , give it to the soil , give it to the fish , and then all kinds of agriculture can ask simply , if we feed more people in cheaper ways , what &apos;s wrong ? what &apos;s wrong ? what &apos;s wrong ?
that &apos;s an incentive . it &apos;s made a reasonable prediction . it &apos;s a business plan for American agriculture .
we should point out the truth of it , the <unk> business , a rapidly occurring business that made it possible .
that &apos;s not a business ; it &apos;s not agriculture .
our food today is under threat , not because it &apos;s in the supply chain , but because of the resources available .
it wasn &apos;t invented by a latest <unk> technology and a tractor version of it , but a fertile soil , not a pump , but a fresh water source , not a diamond , but a forest , not a <unk> and a nets , but a fish in the ocean .
want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better yet , how do we create an environment where it can feed every community ?
to do that , don &apos;t expect the future for agriculture models .
it &apos;s obsolete , and it &apos;s tired .
because it &apos;s dependent on multi @-@ capital , chemistry , and machinery , and it doesn &apos;t really produce good food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s been around for two billion years and two billion years .
take a look at farmers like <unk> .
it &apos;s not just their own farm , it &apos;s self @-@ sufficiency , it &apos;s not about consumption , it &apos;s not about the farm , it &apos;s not just about the farm , it &apos;s not just about the farmer , it &apos;s about the farmer .
because they &apos;re also experts in flavor .
and if I want to be honest , they &apos;re better than I am .
you know , I completely agree with this , because if the future good food is so good , they must be delicious .
thank you .
and if I want to leave you with one idea today , which is that all of the data that we consume is vastly greater than the sum of the parts , which is that all of the data that we consume , the amount of data that we consume , the amount of data that we &apos;re consuming , the amount of data that we &apos;re consuming , the amount of data that we &apos;re consuming , the data that you see instead of information , and I want to add up , and I want to add up
so what we see here is a typical death chart as age .
the tool I use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and I can filter that particular cause of death , like an accident .
immediately , I saw a different model .
and that &apos;s because , in the middle , people are living in the middle of their time , and they &apos;re here , and they &apos;re also the <unk> .
we can rearrange the causes of death by dying , and we see that recycling data and cancer are the major conditions for death , but it &apos;s not true for everyone .
if we filter it up , like 40 years old , we can see that that accident is a pretty good killer for people .
and if you dig further , it turns out that this one , particularly for men .
all right , you probably know the role of this tool is to look at information in this way , data is very much like living data .
and if we can do this with the raw data , why don &apos;t we do it on the content ?
so we &apos;re showing here every single issue we &apos;ve ever had in the history of sport .
all over here , all on the Web .
you can go back to your room after I finished .
you can look at it in 10 years .
you can go deep a year .
you can go directly into one issue .
I saw this ; I saw this once in my life as a <unk> athlete , sports .
I &apos;m a fan of Karen Armstrong , so I &apos;m clicking on it and showing me all of this is just part of Karen Armstrong &apos;s problem .
now , if I just wanted to sample the peak of this data , I thought , okay , what about all the bikes athletes ?
so I can take a step back and scale this up .
I saw Greg <unk> .
so you have to understand that as you walk through the narrow information in this way , the <unk> , the backwards , you &apos;re not search , you &apos;re not browsing .
what you &apos;re doing is actually slightly different .
in between , and we think that changes the way information is used .
so I came up with something a little bit crazy about this idea .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve just plucked every Wikipedia page and then compress it to a little <unk> .
and the quote contains a diagram of the profile that comes from the field of expertise .
I &apos;m just showing 500 of the popular Wikipedia pages here .
but even in these limited browsing , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we learned what the most popular thing in Wikipedia is .
I continue and select government .
now , with the post @-@ chosen government , I can see the most frequent contrast of the Wikipedia @-@ Time <unk> .
and that &apos;s important because it &apos;s a content that doesn &apos;t belong to any <unk> site .
it &apos;s only when you step back and look at the big picture , it &apos;s possible to see .
look at one of these special terms , and then I can dive into the Time magazine and dive into them .
so , if you look at these guys , I can see that most of them come from government . some of them come from the scientific world . fewer parts come from business . one of them is my boss .
and the interesting thing is , <unk> is also the great prize winner of TED .
so we can continue , and look at all the grand prize winners of TED .
so you see , this is the first time we &apos;re running through the network as if it &apos;s a web , not just a page , but a net @-@ page web net on a much higher level .
so I want to tell you about another thing that might surprise you .
I &apos;m just showing you the New York Times website .
<unk> , the app -- I don &apos;t want to call it the browser , it &apos;s really not just a browser , but you can actually browse the pages -- and we introduced every website like this to a site like this , and we brought it back to every website like this , and we introduced it to every website like this one of these Web @-@ like technologies .
so I can step back and step back to a specific place .
and why this is important is because , in this way , the benefits of the page , I can look at my entire history in exactly the same way .
so I was able to dive into that specific moment .
here , in fact , that &apos;s all I showed you .
and I can sort of <unk> what I saw earlier today .
if I want to step back and look at everything , I can cut my history by perhaps my search history , and here I did some search @-@ and @-@ searching search , searching , and find some articles about Microsoft &apos;s <unk> .
and from this , I can go into the pages just to page them .
this is the same information , because different goals are used multiple times , <unk> each time , allowing it to be more information than the whole of the combination , and each time it <unk> , makes it more information than the sum of the pieces .
now , in the world , we talk about data often about this curse .
we talked about the explosion of information .
we &apos;re talking about leaks in the ocean .
suppose we can turn this idea around and zoom in on the web , and instead of looking at each other &apos;s links , let &apos;s start to look at the diversity of information , and see all the unseen patterns , the hidden patterns , and see the patterns outside , the hidden patterns that we see in this way ?
if we can do that instead of just being stuck in the data , we can really get access to information .
and not just processing information , we can tease out the knowledge .
if we get knowledge , then we can even find intelligence .
thank you .
I grew up in science fiction .
in high school , I was going to take an hour @-@ and @-@ a @-@ hour bus ride back to school every day .
I &apos;ve been immersed in books for a long time , and the science science science fiction brought my ideas to other parts of the world , in a way of storytelling , satisfying my sense of wonder .
besides , I was also curious to see in other respects : whenever I didn &apos;t need to go to the trees , hike and collect and <unk> , frogs and snakes , <unk> , <unk> , everything in the home , everything comes back to the microscope .
I was like a science <unk> .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , about the boundaries of possibility .
and my love for science fiction was also reaction to the world around me , because at the end of the &apos; 60s , the man began to dive into the deep sea .
Jacques Jacques <unk> put his amazing visual effects into our lives , and it showed us the animals and the landscape and the beautiful world that we could not imagine .
all of this seems to resonate with science fiction .
at the same time , I was an artist .
I could paint .
and I also found that because there were no video games , special effects in the movies and the mass <unk> that I had to create in my mind at that time .
and believe that all of us , as young as a child , are more likely to play the movie as it were in our brains .
and my response to that is to introduce the aliens , the world , the robots , the spacecraft , the spacecraft , etc .
I was hiding the textbook in the back of the textbook , always covered in <unk> .
and as a result , I had to ask for other ways of creativity .
interestingly , the Jacques <unk> film made me wonder that there was an alien world on Earth .
I might not be able to really go to the alien world in my lifetime . it sounds so disastrous .
but there &apos;s a world that really exists on this planet that I can actually go to -- the <unk> and the <unk> of all of my books .
so the year I was 15 , I decided to become a divers .
but the only problem was , I was living in a small village in Canada , and the nearest sea was 600 miles away .
but I didn &apos;t stop there .
I repeated my father again , until he found a dive in New York , and it was right on the other side of the border .
so I got my dive license in a swimming pool of water in a swimming pool of water .
but in the next two years I &apos;ve actually seen the sea , until we moved to California .
over the next 40 years , I spent approximately 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours in the submersible .
and what I found in the deep sea -- even the shallow water -- was filled with amazing life , far beyond our imagination .
the imagination of our species is far more comprehensive than nature &apos;s imagination .
it wasn &apos;t until today when I was diving and I was amazed .
I &apos;m passionate about the ocean , never changed .
but when I got bored , I picked up the movie .
and it seemed to me that this is the best way to combine my storytelling and the desire to create an imagery .
as a child , I always paint cartoons .
and the movie makes an image and a story , and it will , of course , happen afterwards .
and of course , the stories I &apos;ve been talking about are the stories of science fiction , &quot; The Terminator and &quot; The <unk> &quot; and &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
and in &quot; The <unk> , &quot; I combine my love of the deep sea and the movies of films together .
add two passions , combine them .
and the &quot; marble &quot; also brings another kind of improvement : in getting better storytelling patterns in the movies , in which we started using computer animation techniques .
the first soft surface of the computer was created , and it was born .
and although that movie happened to be back to Ben , I saw an amazing scene -- the magic that the audiences all over the world were brought to .
and that &apos;s what Arthur C. Clarke , when technologies and magic come apart .
and what the audience saw was this magic .
this is what excites me .
and I was thinking , &quot; Oh my God , this technology had to go viral in the movie . &quot;
so in my next movie &quot; Terminator , &quot; The Terminator 2 , &quot; we pushed this technology to the new steps .
by working with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , we created the liquid metal guy in the movie , and the success of the movie depends on whether this technology works .
and it worked . we created the magic again , and we got the same feedback from the audience , but the movie department was a little bit better .
once we add those two experiences , we realize that this is going to be a new world for the filmmaker to play an entirely new world .
so I started a company with my friends , <unk> <unk> , and the name of the <unk> and the name of the company was called the digital <unk> .
and the idea behind the company is to develop a simulation of the past and so forth , directly into digital fabrication .
in fact , we did , and it took us over a period of time .
but in the mid @-@ 1990s , we discovered that even though companies were designed to have suffered in biological , human beings , we were on the one hand .
so I created this piece called &quot; The <unk> , &quot; which was designed to push the visual impact of the computer graphics and computer graphics to create real human emotions , mainly created by the computer .
but I touched the computer . and the people in our company told me that we couldn &apos;t do this kind of special effects at the time .
so I put this idea over there , and I moved to a film about the ocean dive down .
and I was talking to the movie company about the movie company , and it was going to be this beautiful epic , romantic movie .
but my real motive was to go and visit the Titanic .
that &apos;s why I made that movie .
I &apos;m talking about the truth . but the movie company was unknown .
and I persuaded them . and I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive in the field , we &apos;re going to be in the field . &quot;
start with the film .
it &apos;s a vital and theater .
so I persuaded them to invest an adventure .
it sounds crazy , but ultimately it &apos;s still about creating a reality if you use your imagination .
in fact , we did create a reality six months later in the North Atlantic -- I was underwater at 2.5 miles underwater in a Russian submersible , looking at the Titanic .
it &apos;s not a movie ; it &apos;s not a high definition ; it &apos;s a realization .
and it made me wonder .
the early days of the project were really bright , and we needed to build cameras and lighting and so forth .
but what really struck me was the kind of deep dives that the universe was exploring .
both of them are high @-@ tech products , both require critical deployment .
you walk into this dark environment , and if you &apos;re not able to return from your strength to return , you &apos;re not likely to be rescued from any rescue .
and I thought , &quot; Oh my God . I was like having a science paper . &quot;
that &apos;s cool ! that &apos;s cool .
and so the deep adventure became my new passion .
and of course , it comes down to one of the curious , scientific implications , that is that everything is <unk> , that unknown , curiosity , that is infinite .
Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me the rare experience .
even though I could imagine a creature , and I could use computer graphics to create it , I couldn &apos;t imagine what I saw that day I was diving through the window .
and in the course of our expedition , I &apos;ve looked at living in the hydrothermal vent , and sometimes I &apos;ve never seen anything that I &apos;ve never seen before , and sometimes seeing something that no one has ever looked at before , even something that we had identified as a scientific record before .
and as a result , I was all <unk> and had to continue .
so I made an amazing decision .
and after the &quot; Titanic &quot; became successful , I decided , &quot; All right , I &apos;ve been working in Hollywood to make movies here , and for the next time , I &apos;m going to become an explorer . &quot;
so we started planning on these expeditions .
we went to the <unk> , and we used the robotic device to detect its debris .
we then went back to the ruins of Titanic .
and it created a bunch of robots that could contain optical fibers .
the goal is to dive into the wreckage and explore inside of it -- an unprecedented act .
no one had ever looked at the wreckage before , and they didn &apos;t need any technology , so we created that technique .
you know , I was on the deck of the Titanic , sitting in a submersible , looking at it like this wooden deck , thinking of the band that I was performing here .
I was manipulating a small robot that flew over the corridors in the sky .
even though I &apos;m manipulating it , my mind is in the field of discovery .
I felt that I was really on the verge of the Titanic .
and that was the most incredible thing that I &apos;ve ever met with , because before the robot &apos;s detect the light on the lights , I already knew everything that was hidden in the corner , and the reason for the movie was made , I spent a lot of months doing this scene .
and the actual sketch from the studio is a real model made out of this ship &apos;s sketch .
so that was an extraordinary experience .
it allowed me to experience a distance @-@ controlled experience -- and we even had the physical form of these robots , and we inject our minds into something else , into something else .
it &apos;s a profound feeling .
perhaps all of this could give us the idea of what the world will be after decades , as a science <unk> , I can imagine the future of human society , using half @-@ a @-@ half @-@ mechanical people to explore and other activities .
so through these expeditions , I began to really appreciate the beauty of the sea floor , the amazing creatures that live in deep @-@ sea creatures , they &apos;re kind of alien creatures on Earth .
they live in a chemical <unk> .
the sun doesn &apos;t need to be entirely lit to us .
so when you see the animals living at 500 degrees heat below the sea floor .
you think they can &apos;t survive at all .
and at the same time , I became interested in the biology of space technology , and it was also affecting science fiction as a young boy .
and as a result , I had a very tight connection with the space community , working with the United States of America , and became part of the research board , the actual spatial mission , to go to Russia , to go to Russia , to see a series of things earlier than the astronauts and so on , to take our 3D video station .
this experience is pretty impressive .
but what I ended up doing was trying to convince the space scientists to follow us in the deep ocean .
it &apos;s a real experience for them . space biologists , <unk> scientists and other people who are interested in extreme environments where we take them to the deep ocean and see and take samples , <unk> and so on .
so what we &apos;re doing is studying the <unk> of science .
I &apos;ve connected it as a science <unk> as a child .
and I learned a lot about this journey .
I learned a lot about science , but I also learned a lot about leadership .
you felt that the director had to be a leader , a leadership , something like that .
but before these expeditions , I knew nothing about leaders .
because I always ask myself , what am I doing ?
why do I do this ? what do I get out of it ? what do I do ?
these damn documentaries don &apos;t make any money .
we want to think that the lights aren &apos;t easy . the flowers are <unk> .
a lot of people think that I was between the Titanic and the movie &quot; The <unk> , &quot; just sitting on the beach .
but actually I made these films , and these were just a few of them .
there &apos;s no money . there &apos;s no money . what are you doing ?
and I do this all for the value of the experience itself as a challenge -- and the world is the most challenging environment , and I do all of this as a surprise of discovery , in the sense of a small group of people affected by a group .
because every time we work with about 10 to 12 people , sometimes two or three months at sea .
and the most important thing you realize in that kind of cohesive period is that you lived with them , you <unk> a task to explain to other people .
and when you go back to the coast , you say , &quot; OK , we need to do this , this optical fibers , this <unk> , and that . the more technology , the productivity of the homework -- these are all the experiences that you can &apos;t explain to other people , and it &apos;s as if the police , as they don &apos;t know that other people are the same kinds of warriors , the brothers are the brothers , the brothers , the brothers are the brothers , the brothers , the brothers , the
create a cohesion , creating a cohesive symbol of love .
so when I came back to make my next movie &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to apply the same principles of leadership -- respect your team , and they re @-@ <unk> you .
and that really changed the dynamic of the team .
I went back to work with a small team to create new technologies that didn &apos;t know existed .
exciting .
it &apos;s a challenge .
in four and a half years , we become a family .
it changed the way I made movies .
and people review this : you bring the habitat back to people &apos;s field and put it on the planet .
for me , more about the laws and the processes themselves have changed the outcomes .
so what have we gained from all this ?
what &apos;s learning ?
the first thing I thought was curiosity .
this is the most powerful thing you have .
the imagination is a force that reflects the power of reality .
and your team is more important than all the rest of the world &apos;s team .
and sometimes a young filmmaker asked me , &quot; Your Honor for some of the films . &quot;
my answer was : don &apos;t stay yourself .
other people are going to be limited to you , you &apos;re going to define the boundary , but you don &apos;t want to be yourself . don &apos;t gamble . lose yourself .
the United States has a famous quote from the United States that they love : it &apos;s not an option . it &apos;s not an option .
but in art and exploration , failure must be an option because all of this requires a challenge .
none of the key to innovation is done without the risk .
you have to take those risks .
and that &apos;s what I want to leave you with : whatever you do , failure is one of them , but fear isn &apos;t . thank you .
what I want to talk about today is energy and climate , and that may be a little bit unexpected .
what I want to talk about today is energy and climate , which may be surprising , because my full @-@ time job at the foundation of the foundation is about the full @-@ time vaccine and the agricultural <unk> that really needs us to invent , to improve the lives of the poorest two billion people in the world , and those are the things we need to invent , the poorest of the planet .
but in fact , energy and climate are more important than anybody else on Earth , but in fact , energy and climate are particularly important to these people , in fact , than everyone else on Earth .
climate degradation means that their crops will not grow for years and years , which means drought or drought , which means that their crops will not grow for years , that means drought , drought , drought , drought , that changes in vulnerable circumstances can &apos;t bear the changes in vulnerable circumstances .
it would cause famine , it would cause a social riots .
so the climate change is going to bring them back to life , and at the same time , it &apos;s also critical for them .
so the climate change is going to bring them back to life , and at the same time , it &apos;s also critical for them .
in fact , if you just reduce the price of something to decrease poverty , you must end up with , in fact , if you only reduce the price of something down to poverty , you would have to be very top @-@ down .
as the human history has come down , modern civilization is based on advanced energy .
as the human history has come down , modern civilization is based on advanced energy .
and the coal revolution that had propelled the industrial revolution early 20th century , and we had a rapid collapse in the beginning of the 20th century , and that was the reason we could enjoy the air conditioning air conditioning in the beginning of the 20th century , and that was why we could enjoy the refrigerators of the air conditioning , and that &apos;s why we can do all kinds of things .
because of electricity , we can live in a rich world .
but when we go further down , like it &apos;s about twice as cheap as we make it , we have a new limit , and that limit is related to CO2 , we have a new limit , that limit is about CO2 .
carbon dioxide is making global warming , and the formula for carbon dioxide emissions is actually very simple carbon dioxide , and the formula for CO2 emissions is actually very simple .
the CO2 emissions today are causing the temperature of the great CO2 emissions , the rise of the temperature rise up to a series of very severe consequences , like the weather effects of the weather , or the embarrassment of the effects of the ecosystem , the consequences of a whole variety of changes in the ecosystem or the effects of the ecosystem , or the consequences of an ecosystem .
what is the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions increasing and temperature , and what &apos;s the difference between the two pieces of CO2 and the temperature of the CO2 and the temperature ? why is the CO2 increased and the temperature of the temperature and the temperature of CO2 , and what &apos;s the difference between the two , why isn &apos;t there a little bit of that stuff ?
there &apos;s a lot of downsides to global warming , and it &apos;s not completely certain , but it &apos;s certainly too severe for global warming , and it &apos;s not quite sure , but it &apos;s certainly pretty severe .
I &apos;ve asked the best scientists over and over and over again : are we really going to reduce CO2 emissions down to zero ? and I &apos;ve been asked several times the top scientists : are we really going to cut CO2 emissions down to zero ?
reduced to half or a quarter of nothing ?
and the answer is , unless we fall to zero , otherwise the temperature rises up to zero , it would be a huge challenge for them , and the answer is , unless we fall to zero , the temperature will go up to zero , that would be a huge challenge .
and the answer is , unless we fall to zero , the temperature rises up to zero , that &apos;s a huge challenge .
it &apos;s different than making a 12 @-@ foot truck with 10 feet of the bridge , as long as you &apos;re trying to get a 12 @-@ foot truck across a 10 @-@ foot bridge , as long as you &apos;re trying to figure out what happens .
carbon dioxide emissions are completely reduced to zero .
we &apos;ve put a lot of CO2 per year , more than half a billion tons of CO2 per year , and we put a lot of CO2 per year , and it &apos;s more than half a billion tons per year .
the United States has about 20 tons per person per person , less than a ton per ton per capita , around five tons per capita , about 20 tons per person per person per person , and less than a ton per capita to about five tons per capita .
the United States has about 20 tons ; less than a ton per person ; about five tons per capita .
anyway , we &apos;re all going to make a difference , until we drop that number down to zero , and we &apos;re all going to make a difference , until we drop that number down to zero .
and the numbers are still going up , and it &apos;s only a little bit that a little bit of a debt that comes up .
and the numbers are still going up , and it &apos;s only a little bit of a debt that comes up a little bit , and we &apos;re going to stop it , not only that we &apos;re going to push it up a little bit faster , but we &apos;re going to turn it down to zero .
there are four factors of CO2 , which are the four factors that multiply the amount of CO2 , and on the right hand side of the equation , our goal is to take it down to zero CO2 per capita , per capita per capita , per capita per capita , per square watt per capita , and look at the amount of CO2 per square unit of energy per capita as we use .
obviously , we need at least one factor of three , which is a simple high school algebra .
obviously , we need at least one factor of three , which is a very simple high school algebra , and let &apos;s see , first of all , population .
let &apos;s take a look , first of all , population .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and it will continue to grow to about nine billion people .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and it will continue to grow to about nine billion people .
if we &apos;re working in new vaccines , new health services , reproductive health , and if we &apos;re working in new vaccines , new health services , reproductive health , it &apos;s possible to decrease 10 to 15 percent , add about 10 to 15 percent , add up to 10 percent of the growth rate as much as 10 to 15 percent .
the second element factor is what we use .
these include everything : the food we eat , the clothes , the clothes , the heat , the heat , the things that are beautiful , including everything : we eat , the food , the clothes , the clothes , the heat , the movies , the beautiful things .
and that includes everything : the food we eat , the clothes , the clothes , the heat , the heat , the heat , the things that are wonderful to get out of poverty , and that means giving them to everyone on the planet , and the poison is good enough to get away from everybody on the planet , and that &apos;s a good thing .
getting out of poverty means providing it to everyone on the planet , and that &apos;s a good thing .
one billion people in the developed world , perhaps the richest one billion people , may be able to control , decrease the amount of services in the developing world , the richest one billion people in the world , maybe not just spending per year , but in general , this number will be doubling every year , and yet it will add up to every year , but it will add up to every year .
in this area , we have services that are very basic : have you ever written lighting in your house ? in this area where we have services that are based on the lighting that you have in your house ?
the kids don &apos;t , so they go out and sit underneath the desk under the street , and the kids aren &apos;t doing it , so they &apos;re going out and sit underneath the desk under the street .
the next element is efficiency , the energy consumption of every service , and we finally have some good news : that &apos;s not going to go up .
and here we finally got some good news : that &apos;s not going to go up .
and through all sorts of innovations and new lighting , through new technologies , new buildings , new ways of being invented and new ways of lighting , through new technologies , new buildings , we can dramatically reduce the amount of energy we use in a lot of services , individual customers , and even 90 percent reduction of the amount of energy we can consume , even reduce the amount of energy we consume .
we can significantly reduce the amount of energy consumed by a lot of services , individual services , even 90 percent .
but other services , like fertilizer , fertilizer , <unk> and so forth , are much more limited in space , but other services like fertilizer , <unk> and so on , can dramatically improve space , but other services , like fertilizer , fertilizer and so forth , can increase the space .
so , combined , the combined estimate of the optimism of this is that we may be able to achieve three to six times five times as much as three times as much as three times as a result , in a combination of the optimism as this : we may be able to achieve three times fewer .
we &apos;ve been talking about three factors , and the biggest contribution are going to go from minus 130 tons , and it &apos;s not enough to talk about three factors , and we &apos;re going to go from 130 gigatons , which is not enough to talk about three tons , which is not even more than 130 tons , which is not enough .
and finally , the fourth factor , the fourth factor , the fourth factor , the fourth factor , the fourth factor , the most important thing , is the CO2 per unit of energy .
the question is , is this really going to fall to zero ?
I &apos;m not sure . I &apos;m not sure .
I &apos;m not sure . I &apos;m not sure .
all the forms of electricity that we have today come to CO2 , except for the developing world , renewables and nuclear , all the electricity that we have today , all of the electricity we have , except for the sustainability of renewables and nuclear .
so we need to create a new system around the world , and we need energy miracles , so we need to create a new system around the world , and we need energy miracles .
so we need to create a new system around the world , and we need energy miracles .
I used the word miracles , but that &apos;s not the point .
it &apos;s a miracle . the PC is a miracle . the Internet and the applications are miracles .
it &apos;s a miracle . the PC is a miracle . the Internet and the applications are miracles .
in other words , you &apos;ve seen a lot of miracles happening here .
typically , we don &apos;t have a final deadline for wonder , so we don &apos;t have the final scenarios for wonder .
normally , you just do something about it , something magical happens , and some of them don &apos;t .
but in the low carbon reductions , we have to go all in all directions , and we have to do that at the end of the story , but before the end of the story , we have to do it in the low carbon emissions , and we have to push it all up , and we have to do this miracle at the end .
and I thought , how can I make this better ? is there a natural expression ?
and I thought , how can I make this better ? is there a natural expression ? is there some kind of demonstration that motivates people &apos;s imagination ?
and I came back about a year ago , and I had some mosquitos here , and it seemed like a pretty good time to think about a year ago , and I brought some of them here , and people seemed kind of liked it .
the mosquito had really realized that there were people in the world living with the mosquito that made that moment to really realize that some people in the world live with the mosquitoes .
so today , since I &apos;m talking about energy , I think of this : fireflies .
and I decided , I &apos;m going to send fireflies to my environmental contribution this year , and I decided that fireflies will be the contribution that I &apos;ve made this year .
there &apos;s a few natural fireflies that say they &apos;re not biting each other , and maybe they &apos;re all alone .
there &apos;s a few natural fireflies that say they &apos;re not biting each other , and maybe they &apos;re all alone .
there &apos;s a few natural fireflies that say they &apos;re not biting each other , and maybe they &apos;ve all made a lot of innovative things like fireflies , but they &apos;re actually quite limited to solving energy problems like fireflies , but they &apos;re actually quite limited .
what we need is a solution , a solution , or a lot of the things that we want to do , and what we need is a solution , a solution , a lot of the things that we want to do , or a lot of <unk> and reliability , even though people are only exploring in five directions right now , I think that &apos;s the only possible .
I didn &apos;t include the tides , the <unk> , the <unk> and the biofuels , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
I didn &apos;t include the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> and the biofuels , and the key thing is that , of course , the challenge is that , of course , the challenge is that we have to engage in all of them , but the key thing is that we have to engage in a lot of them , because they don &apos;t seem to be challenged , because they seem to give up .
let &apos;s take a look at fossil fuels , or fossil fuels , or first of all , look at the fossil fuels , or fossil fuels , or <unk> .
what we need to do , simply to say , is not simply the need to take all that burning carbon dioxide , put it all together with the chimneys , pressure , stored , oxygen pressure , everything you need to do is to take all the CO2 generated , put it through the cracks in , heat , heat and keep the threat off , and then you don &apos;t need to burn all the pumps , you .
the current trials have been done 60 to 80 percent of the time , but it &apos;s going to be a 100 percent difficult one in 100 to 80 percent present , and it &apos;s a long @-@ term problem .
who can make it ?
billions of times as much waste as any other waste waste waste , who &apos;s going to make a long @-@ term safety ? these waste is worth billions of times as much as any waste and waste , and who can make sure that long @-@ term security ?
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 , so it &apos;s very difficult .
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 , so it &apos;s very difficult .
next , nuclear , again , three big questions .
next , nuclear energy , again , has three big problems , and it costs the same cost , especially in highly @-@ controlled states , very safe questions , to make sure everything is <unk> , even if it &apos;s not used as weapons .
what about nuclear waste ?
there &apos;s a lot of concerns about it .
the good solution has to make people feel secure .
it &apos;s three difficult , but it &apos;s possible to solve , so it &apos;s going to work .
the last three out of five energy sources , I &apos;ll put them together .
these are three sources of energy that people call renewable energy .
in fact , they don &apos;t need fuel , but they don &apos;t have to .
the first is the density of energy that these technologies collect , which is much lower than the power plant , and the first is the density of the energy that these technologies collect , which is much lower than the plant .
it &apos;s energy agriculture ; it &apos;s scale ; it &apos;s smaller than regular power plants .
and also , these energy are <unk> .
the sun is not all day long , not every day , but every day , the wind isn &apos;t always blowing .
if you &apos;re totally dependent on this source , you have other channels of energy , and you have other channels for energy , you have other channels of electricity , you have other channels of energy .
so , we have a huge cost problem , and we have a challenge for transmission , for example , a source of energy coming from abroad , not only are you going to need energy insurance , not just to your own domestic risk .
and finally , the issue of storage .
in order to make this problem visible , I looked at all of the current battery that we have in order to make this problem visible , and I looked at all the battery that we have today , all the computers , all the processors , all the processors , all the battery on the battery in the world , and I don &apos;t see the 10 minutes that we have today .
so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough to solve a 100 times better solution than the technology we have today , a 100 @-@ times better solution than today .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
so , we can use about 20 to 30 percent of the energy that &apos;s required by <unk> .
but if you want 100 percent to rely on it , you need a very efficient miracle battery .
so how do we go ? what &apos;s the right way ?
is this a Manhattan Project ? how can we get there ?
we need a lot of companies working together , working together .
every team in five ways , we all need at least 100 people .
a lot of people inside you feel they &apos;re crazy , and that &apos;s right .
I think there &apos;s been a lot of people in the TED community that are beginning to do this .
Bill <unk> has four companies , one of them is called <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a pretty cool solar @-@ hot source technology , Bill <unk> , and one of them is a company called <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a very cool <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> investing in <unk> , their job is great , and it &apos;s interesting , and I plan to support their projects .
it &apos;s actually a little bit surprising that I &apos;ve been working on a company that might be surprised , but it &apos;s a nuclear approach .
in nuclear energy , there &apos;s a little bit of innovation , things like molding , liquid , liquid , etc .
but actually innovation in the industry has stopped for a while , so there &apos;s some good ideas that aren &apos;t weird things .
and the idea was that , instead of burning uranium , which isn &apos;t typical of usual , you can &apos;t burn normally , but it &apos;s 99 percent of the stuff that &apos;s left there .
it &apos;s a little crazy idea , but actually , people have been talking about it for a long time .
it &apos;s a bit of a crazy idea , but actually , people have talked a lot about a long time , but they &apos;re not really good at demonstrating whether it &apos;s possible to have a modern supercomputers advancing , and we can now do this simulation , and it &apos;s predictable , as long as possible , it &apos;s possible .
and also , because the waste that we were burning was 99 percent of the waste that was once thrown away .
you actually take waste , and you don &apos;t have to worry about what to do with all of the waste from the nuclear reactors , which is a great message .
we don &apos;t have to worry about the waste from all nuclear reactors , which is a good news .
this technology is like a candle , and gradually <unk> tons of waste .
and the process is like this column , which is usually called a <unk> reactor .
the fuel problem is solved .
this is a waste field in Kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , and that &apos;s 99 percent of all that fuel that &apos;s already out of business as usual .
these can be all for hundreds of years .
in addition , just through the amount of fuel you get from a low @-@ cost filter process to the Earth .
you see , there &apos;s a lot of challenges in front , but this is just an example of one of the ways in which we can continue .
think about how we measure our achievement .
how much should our school report be ?
let &apos;s start with what we want to do , and let &apos;s take a look at what we want to do in the middle , and look at what we want to do .
there &apos;s been a lot of people talking about 80 percent since 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we have to do it .
and the 20 percent of the country &apos;s population , like some agricultural countries , and hopefully we &apos;ve cleaned up the <unk> and the concrete industry .
so , to get to 80 percent of the developed world , and the country in China has to change how they generate electricity .
and the next step is , have we deploy the technologies , have we put them all in the developed world , and have them spread out to other parts ?
that &apos;s important .
and this is the key ingredient to hand .
what should we do in 2020 for 2020 ?
well , there are two parts .
we should be looking at the criteria that we have to look at , the less efficiencies we have to start to reduce our emissions , the less CO2 in the atmosphere as well .
but in a way , one of the things that we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve done a little bit of the year 2020 , but it &apos;s not just the equivalent of the massive amounts of cutting emissions , or the importance of lower emissions , or lower carbon footprint , and that &apos;s the key for innovation .
we need to be able to get all of these technological advances , the number of companies that we can participate in , the test programs , or the pace of policy changes .
there &apos;s a lot of great books about this topic .
for example , Al , &quot; our choice &quot; David cries , &quot; the heat of the heat , the heat of the sun . &quot;
they were looking at it and they built a framework that was easy to talk about , because we had to ask the right question .
it takes a lot of collaboration .
this is a wish .
we invented this technology as a very specific wish .
if I could give a wish for the next 50 years , I could choose who came to be a president or a vaccine , which was my passion , or my energy choice , and it would create a technology that will halve the amount of carbon , and I would certainly choose the energy .
that &apos;s one of the biggest influences .
if we can &apos;t fulfill this wish of a short @-@ term goal and a long @-@ term goal , there will be a huge disagreement between the United States and China , the rich countries and the rich countries , and the poorest two billion of us , most of the poorest are worse in the world .
so what do we have to do ?
what did I ask you to engage in ?
we should add research to aid .
in a conference like Copenhagen , the nations around the world should not only talk about carbon dioxide .
I should also talk about innovation &apos;s schedule , and it &apos;s absolutely amazing how innovation works .
we really need some market incentives , carbon dioxide , <unk> and trading , for these things to produce price signals .
we need to get information out .
we should have made this dialogue more conceptual , more understandable , including the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , and I think this is a wish to happen .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you , and I learned more about <unk> , first of all , can you say about how big this investment would be ?
Bill Gates : if it &apos;s just buying a supercomputer , making a software scientist , these are the kinds of things we &apos;ve done , maybe even in a Russian reactor testing our material to see if it &apos;s working properly , it &apos;s a few billion dollars .
and the hardest part is to build these reactors , which is billions of times , look at the managers and places , and make the first line of nuclear power .
and when you built the first thing , if it really works like that , everything is simple , because its economy , its energy density , energy density is completely different than the nuclear energy that we &apos;re familiar with .
well , does it mean that it needs to be built underground with this sort of closed @-@ ended columns using this sort of abandoned <unk> square @-@ steel cylinder made of uranium and columns from the bottom up ?
right . now the nuclear reactors , you &apos;ve got to add up all the time , so there &apos;s a lot of <unk> and control that might go wrong , and you &apos;ve got to open up the reactor and bring it out , and it &apos;s going to go wrong , and it &apos;s a little bit wrong , and it &apos;s going to get out of the wrong stuff , and it &apos;s kind of insurance .
so if you have very cheap fuel , a exactly the size of a six @-@ year @-@ old enough to use it in 60 years , so if you have a really cheap fuel , a two @-@ passenger fuel , put it down in 60 years , there &apos;s no complex consequences .
put them there for 60 years , and then it was gone .
that is the kind of nuclear power plant itself , the waste itself .
right . the waste from this process is generated , you can just put it there , and you can just burn it with very little waste , and you can burn it in another one , and you can put it in another nuclear power plant , and you can burn it in a different nuclear power plant .
we can begin to deal with the waste from existing nuclear plants , the waste that &apos;s cooled the pits or the reactor that we started with .
so , the current problems of those reactors are a problem , but they &apos;re also accelerating the waste so that the current waste is in our own problem , and it becomes our own waste , and it &apos;s reducing our waste so that the current reactor is in the same time as our ingredients , while at the same time as our current waste is reduced .
you talk to someone else in other places about the possibility .
who was interested in doing it the biggest thing ?
J We haven &apos;t chosen a specific place , because there &apos;s a lock on nuclear problems , and a lot of people are interested in Russia , and the Indian companies in India , and I &apos;ve been also been talking about how I &apos;ve been talking about integrating this in energy content .
I &apos;m optimistic , and also France and Japan have done some work .
this is a variant of accomplishment .
it &apos;s an important improvement , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor that many countries have built , as long as you &apos;ve already had fast reactors , it could be the first nuclear waste ever used .
and you see , what about the time and possibility of this project , the time and the possibility of that project ?
Gates : build a massive power plant , and it costs a very low amount of money to build a massive power plant , and it costs us 20 years to invent , another 20 years to implement it .
and that &apos;s basically the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ end version of our environmental model , and that &apos;s basically the end of our environmental model .
and if everything goes well , of course it &apos;s not easy , it &apos;s easy to meet , and if everything goes well , then of course it &apos;s not easy , it &apos;s easy to meet .
and currently there are <unk> companies doing this , and we need to learn that if they &apos;re going well , if they &apos;re going to work on the funding of the money plant , they &apos;re all going to be able to compete with this task .
if you can succeed , it &apos;s best because it can be used in multiple ways .
but we need at least one to succeed .
what if the biggest innovation ever could ever be , was that the biggest innovation you know ?
the breakthrough of energy is the most important thing .
even if there &apos;s no environmental limitations , it &apos;s going to be the most important question of environmental limitations that make it wider .
in nuclear fields , there are other inventors .
but I didn &apos;t know what they were doing , and we didn &apos;t know that some people were innovation in the module , and it was another way .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that &apos;s kind of difficult , but maybe they look at the way we do .
so , there &apos;s a lot of different ways , but the beautiful thing about nuclear energy is that there &apos;s a lot of different energy in a lot of other stuff , like coal , but nuclear is a million times the beauty of nuclear , and nuclear is uranium , a molecule that comes from other molecules , like a million times the potential , and basically a million times the mass radiation , if it is good enough , and radiation , and radiation , and oxygen .
Moderator : what if we haven &apos;t succeeded ?
what kind of heat do we need to take to make sure the planet &apos;s temperature is stable ?
Bill Gates : what if things were growing like eating too much , could you have a heart attack , you might need heart surgery , etc .
there &apos;s a study called geo @-@ engineered technology to slow down global warming for 20 or 30 years to come together .
but that was like a insurance policy .
you want you to not use it .
some people say there &apos;s no need to study insurance , because it &apos;s going to keep you eating , but you know that the heart can save you .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s the point of thinking about the problem , and I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart enough to talk about the earth as a backup plan , in case it &apos;s going to get worse , or later on in advance of technological innovation .
Moderator : how would you convince them of climate change if you let them say something to them ?
climate : unfortunately , the skeptics came from different camps .
very few of them have science evidence .
they say that the outcomes of the cloud are due to the connections of clouds , and they say the consequences of the cloud are caused by the cloud .
they have very few compelling evidence that even one @-@ in @-@ a @-@ million chance .
the main question here is HIV .
now it &apos;s wrong , and it &apos;s going to double your pain in the future .
so when you &apos;ve got an urge to spend a lot of time in the future , and a uncertain pain , the IPCC report , it wasn &apos;t the worst , and somebody looked at it in the developed world said it wasn &apos;t a big deal , and somebody looked at it in the developed world .
in fact , uncertainty should really increase our effort into that .
but my wish is , if you add energy production to the economy , and it <unk> CO2 , but my wish is , if you turn energy into an economy , and also if you add CO2 emissions to CO2 emissions , which says , &quot; OK , although I don &apos;t care about CO2 emissions a little bit better than CO2 emissions , I hope it &apos;s better than CO2 emissions . &quot;
but I &apos;m going to take this new approach , because energy is cheaper than ever before , and that &apos;s the response to whether you &apos;re comparing all your money to solve CO2 problems , and that is to say , if you spend all your energy trying to solve all the important things that we &apos;re trying to solve , the poverty of the world , and so on .
J The actual R &amp; amp ; D is not that much , while the United States should be spending more than 100 bucks a year on this , it should not affect any of the other things that are actually going to happen , but it &apos;s not going to affect the amount of other things that we &apos;re going to spend per year in the United States .
J The actual R &amp; amp ; D is not that much , until the United States should be spending 100 bucks a year on that , and that should not affect anything else .
for the cause of a career , if there &apos;s no money , it &apos;s basically a waste of money for me , and there &apos;s a difference in the career that needs money , and if it &apos;s not given back , it &apos;s basically a waste of money for me , and some people may disagree about the different things , and if it &apos;s not an economic contribution , I don &apos;t have any basic value .
unless you &apos;ve been very close to success , and you &apos;re investing in the portfolio , and it &apos;s going to become very cheap , unless you &apos;re close to success , and you &apos;re investing in the portfolio , and it &apos;s going to be cheap , otherwise I think we should try to have a solution for the potential , and I think we should try to have low @-@ cost solutions .
if you &apos;re going to solve the climate problem , finally making energy incredibly expensive , the only rich man has to use to solve the climate problem , and then finally make energy more expensive , the richest is rich .
for those of you who sit down for five times , it &apos;s not going to affect the way we live in life , and it &apos;s not going to affect the way we live in life if it &apos;s five times more or five times .
but for the two billion people on Earth , the poor are a disaster .
and the idea of <unk> has changed , and his argument is now , why haven &apos;t more attention ?
and the idea of <unk> has changed , and his argument is now , why haven &apos;t more attention ?
and the reason it &apos;s based on history , he &apos;s still in the camp , but he &apos;s realized that that &apos;s a fairly lonely place , because of historical reason , he was in the camp , but he was a rather lonely camp , and he was alone in the camp , but he realized that it was a rather lonely place , and that was a very lonely place .
and I think that &apos;s a really worth discussing , because there &apos;s so little engagement for science .
and I think that &apos;s a really worth discussing , because there &apos;s so little engagement for science .
Bill , I think most people here are like me , really hope your dream come true , thank you very much . Moderator : Bill , I think most of you are like me , really hope your dream come true . thank you very much .
audience : thank you .
a few years ago , at TED , Peter <unk> introduced a design challenge called the <unk> <unk> Challenge .
it &apos;s a very simple idea : a group of four people on a team of four people creating a single , single @-@ largest building material , 20 <unk> in Italy , an Italian remix tape , a piece of cotton candy .
the cotton has to put it on the top .
it &apos;s not easy , it &apos;s not easy , because it requires people to collaborate fast .
I thought this was an interesting idea , and I put it in a design conference .
and it was pretty successful .
since then , I &apos;ve spent more than 70 design events all around the world , getting students and designers , architects and even the 50 senior technologists in the world , and this practice has given us a profound insight in many ways that taught us how to collaborate , and here I share some of these with you .
normally , people always start talking about this task .
they were talking about what would happen , and they were talking about what they were right and wrong .
and then they spend a little bit of time planning , and they put them on their drawings and they take them out the pasta .
they used a lot of time to assemble spaghetti sauce , which is getting more and more high .
and then finally , the time was finished , and they took the cotton candy and they put it on the top of the sugar , and then they went back , and they looked at the result .
but most of the time , what really happened was the <unk> @-@ ha @-@ ha got really bad because the weight of the cotton candy put the structure into the structure .
there are a few people whose business school party got worse than everybody else , and the worst of all is the new business schools .
they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re lying , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re vulnerable to delay .
and of course there were teams , and they created more <unk> , and the best of all , the new kindergarten kids .
it &apos;s just phenomenal .
as Laura Lee told us , they not only built the highest building , but they built the structure as the most interesting .
so you ask the question , what &apos;s the characteristics of them ?
and Peter liked this : because there were no children trying to be the CEO of an Italian <unk> .
they didn &apos;t spend any time in power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
because business school students are trained to find the right thing .
and then they follow the plan .
but the truth is , when they put the cotton at the top they had a finite amount of time , and what happened ?
the crisis came .
sound familiar ? yes .
and kindergarten kids do different things , and they start with the cotton candy , they take a prototype model , and they &apos;re constantly modeling it , and they keep it on the top , so they have a lot of opportunities to re @-@ model models .
and so the designer realized that this was a key ingredient in this interaction .
for every version , the children quickly get feedback and they know what &apos;s right and nothing .
so the ability to grasp the prototype is real , and let &apos;s see how different teams work .
the average of the <unk> Tower is about 20 feet of business school students , about half a lawyer , but not anywhere in kindergarten , better than most adults .
who did it best ?
architects and engineers , thank you .
the tallest tower I &apos;ve ever met is 39 inches .
why ? because they understand that triangles and self @-@ strengthening geometry is the key to the structure of stability .
the CEOs are a little bit better than average , but the interesting thing is that the CEOs are above average .
if you add a class in their group , they get a lot better .
it &apos;s just incredible . you look around and you say , &quot; <unk> won &apos;t win . &quot;
you already know why ?
because they have special simplicity .
they manage the processes . they understand the processes .
in short , any small group of positive governance and focus on the work itself has phenomenal increases .
special skills and good combination of simplicity brings successful both .
if you &apos;ve got 10 of them participate in this activity , there &apos;s about six of them that can build structures that are upright .
I made an interesting try .
I thought , let &apos;s make a bet .
so I was able to provide a million dollar @-@ worth of software to a few groups of electronics .
and guess what happens when the students who study design ?
what happened ?
and that &apos;s the result . there &apos;s no group that just finished a standing building .
even if any small group has done an inch @-@ inch building , they can put the prize in .
so , what &apos;s interesting is that the professionals have a huge impact .
and we repeated it again in the same students .
and guess what ?
and here they know the value of the <unk> model .
so the worst group became the best team .
they took the lowest amount of time .
all of this is very deep in education , and this explains the essence of rewards and success .
so , you might ask yourself , &quot; How is it going to take a while to write a cotton candy challenge ? &quot;
and the reason for that is that I can use <unk> and processes to help people build cars , video games and visualization .
and the challenge of the cotton candy is to recognize some assumptions that are hidden .
because , frankly , every project has their own cotton candy .
the challenge is the universal access to shared experience , a common language dealing with problems .
it &apos;s this simple exercise that gives us valuable experience .
you &apos;re interested in <unk>
this is a blog you can read and tell you how to build cotton .
there &apos;s a specific set of steps .
and there &apos;s weird examples from all over the world , and how people can adjust the system .
there &apos;s a world record there .
and I believe the bottom line is that design is actually a form of communication .
it requires us to put all of our collective ingenuity into our task and ask us to use the best mental states , our sense of actions to welcome our challenge .
and sometimes , an experience of a small model will help us turn it into the second moment of <unk> , which is the second time that we got rid of the time of the <unk> .
and the result of that is different .
thank you .
let &apos;s imagine there &apos;s a machine here .
it &apos;s a big , cool , TED machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
everybody here has to come into this time machine .
you can choose to go back to the past or to the future , which is not the present .
and I &apos;m thinking what you &apos;re going to pick , and I &apos;ve asked a lot of times since I &apos;ve asked my friend this question , and their answer is , they come back to the past .
I don &apos;t understand . they say , back to the time when there were no cars or Twitter or American Idol .
I really don &apos;t understand .
I &apos;m sure there must be a bit of a <unk> or a little <unk> here .
and I can understand that too .
but I have to admit , I &apos;m not here with them .
I don &apos;t want to go back , not because I like adventure .
it &apos;s because the probability of the Earth , not to go to the past , you have to go to the future .
in other words , I wanted to walk into this machine and go to the future .
our age is the best time , no matter what way you measure it , like health , mobility , opportunity and opportunity , rate rates go down .
there &apos;s never been a great time .
my grandparents died at the age of 60 .
my grandparents died in their 70s .
my parents died when I was 80 .
I wish I was dying at the beginning of a nine @-@ digit number .
but it &apos;s not just about us , because it &apos;s more than ourselves .
a child born in Delhi today can be as big as 100 years ago .
think about it . it &apos;s an amazing fact .
why is this happening ?
because we eradicated smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on the planet .
it <unk> the population of the Earth &apos;s population , and it &apos;s virtually impossible than any war .
but it &apos;s been wiped out today .
it was something that humanity had thrown out .
today in the rich world , just one generation ago , given millions of people a dying disease , almost no longer emerged .
more recently , Germany , entrepreneurs , almost no polio .
do you know what those names mean ?
vaccines and modern medicine and the ability to provide food for millions of people in modern medicine , these are the winners of science .
in my opinion , the scientific method is that constant attempts , the process of change , it &apos;s one of the greatest <unk> of humankind .
so these are good news .
but unfortunately , the good news is so much , because we &apos;ve come across some other problems , and many times .
one of them is , although we &apos;ve made a huge progress , there are a billion people in the world right now , <unk> a day , and they suffer from hunger every day .
the numbers are rising , and it &apos;s increasing fast enough . it &apos;s enough for us to <unk> .
not only that , but the imagination of the human imagination gave a huge amount of garbage on Earth .
drinking water , tropical rainforests , oil , gas , all these resources are disappearing and disappearing fast unless we understand innovation , we don &apos;t have any hope .
the question is : can we do it ? I think we can .
I think we can produce enough food for billions of people , and not damage the land that they live on .
and I think we can find <unk> energy to supply the world &apos;s energy .
and I really believe that &apos;s the theory , and it &apos;s certainly not true .
but I always couldn &apos;t sleep at night . this is one of the things that kept me in the evening . human history had never , ever needed technology like this today .
and in history , we haven &apos;t had the opportunity to use these technologies as we are today .
in many of the fields , we were all standing in the age of amazing discoveries , and in fact , I think we need to go back to 300 years ago , just before the Renaissance , there was a time when someone was going to be more violent than we are today to become more violent than we are today .
people always like to put themselves in their own framework , and they leave themselves dead so often to die .
even when they hear truth , they can &apos;t shake them .
listen , everybody can hold onto his point , they can even insist on the point of progress .
but do you know what you can &apos;t stick with ?
you can &apos;t just stick with what you know . you can &apos;t .
it took me a while to learn .
about 10 years ago , I wrote a story to The New Yorker about a small vaccine .
but what I discovered was that there were so many other examples of what they were against was the most effective public health measures in human history .
I really don &apos;t know what to do , and I just do what I do . the story is done , and I do something else .
shortly after , I wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
it got a lot of opposition , and it got a lot more over time .
people were mad .
and so I wrote an article on that , and I couldn &apos;t really understand why people would understand this as <unk> food for the Devil , I don &apos;t understand why people think that , in a particular way , rather than in any way , living molecules are nature .
but I was just doing what I was supposed to do , and the story ended up , and I didn &apos;t care about it .
I was a journalist .
our writing is writing , writing , dinner , and that &apos;s our life .
but it wasn &apos;t good enough for me , and I didn &apos;t know why , until later I knew .
the ones that made me crazy , <unk> molecules weren &apos;t actually <unk> molecules .
they &apos;re people who have ideas , people who have great education , and integrity .
they &apos;re like people in this room .
it really bothers me .
and I thought , to be honest .
our age today is different from what has happened .
we &apos;re now seeing progress in a curious way .
we &apos;re going to talk about progress in the context of irony , and adding &quot; <unk> &quot; to chance .
and I think there &apos;s a reason for that , and we know why .
we have lost trust in the civilian institutions , sometimes for government , sometimes for science , for the reasons we don &apos;t trust .
just a few names , and you know what happened .
Chernobyl , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the vote for arthritis , the weapons of mass destruction , half of which was vote .
I think you can put a list in your mind .
and the question of total trust in our past is , there &apos;s a problem now . so people should have a bit of skeptical .
ask a few questions , ask for proving and evidence .
you can &apos;t believe anything .
but one thing to notice is that when you get the evidence , you need to accept the evidence , but we &apos;re not good at it .
and the reason for that , I think , is that we now all have this fear of an epidemic of the <unk> and the depth of the disease that I &apos;ve never experienced , and hopefully later on in life .
12 years ago , the media had written a message , which was a very scary message , which was bringing autism and <unk> and vaccines together .
it &apos;s really frightening .
so there &apos;s a lot of research going on around this .
and there &apos;s a need to do this , because it &apos;s a serious event .
and the data came out .
the same conclusion from the United States , the U.K. and Sweden and Canada , is that autism and vaccines have nothing to do with them , no connections , no connection , no connection .
but that turns out there &apos;s not a lot of sense to the public , because we like to listen to small stories , we believe that what we see in our eyes , believe that what we see in our hearts is believing in the things that make us real .
but it &apos;s just that you don &apos;t believe a stack of trials that came from government data , and I can understand this , and I think all of us have this kind of psychological .
but what happened ?
the consequences are unbelievable .
listen to this fact : the United States is the only country in the world where measles was failing .
that &apos;s enough for us to shame , and we should be ashamed of that .
it &apos;s frightening .
what caused this happen ?
now I understand . I really understand .
have anybody here ever done measles ?
did any of you see other people dying of measles ?
no , no more .
in fact , it doesn &apos;t happen in this country , but in the last year , 16 million people have died because of measles .
this number is huge , basically 20 people every hour die .
but because it wasn &apos;t happening next to us , we could no matter whether this happened , people like Mo Ibrahim were still able to spread their <unk> and their <unk> on &quot; Steven &quot; and &quot; gold . &quot;
and the reason they did this is because they didn &apos;t put it together .
they don &apos;t know , things that look the same , actually never looked the same .
we need lessons from all of that , and we need to learn more from it .
this guy , <unk> <unk> , is a hero .
because he invented the polio vaccine for people to avoid the worst disasters .
now people don &apos;t need to be afraid of this disease , and they don &apos;t have the pain , polio disappeared .
that guy in the middle wasn &apos;t that upsetting .
he &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
he and a couple of other researchers have developed vaccines .
this vaccine , every year , saves four billion children in the developing world .
it should be good , right ?
and that &apos;s great . this is Paul going around and talking to people about this vaccine , and how good they are , how good they are , and people can come from above .
he did .
so we looked at Paul as the terrorists .
when Paul had to disclose , he had to have security guard around him .
he gets a call home because people tell him where his child is in school .
why ? because Paul invented a vaccine .
I don &apos;t have to talk about this , but vaccines are really important .
once it stops the vaccine , it &apos;s going to come back , and it &apos;s a terrible disease that &apos;s happening .
now the United States has come along with measles .
and it gets worse and worse , and soon afterwards there &apos;s children dying of this disease , which is just a number problem .
not just measles .
and polio , who dare say it doesn &apos;t happen again ?
a friend of mine wrote a letter to me a few weeks ago , and she said I &apos;m a little bit too <unk> now .
no one ever said that before .
she said she wasn &apos;t going to vaccinate children . she certainly wasn &apos;t .
all right .
why ? because there &apos;s not polio in this country , but you know ?
we didn &apos;t have this disease yesterday .
today , I don &apos;t know , perhaps a guest flew from a Lagos bus , and his destination was Los Angeles airport , and now to Ohio .
a few hours later , he was on the ground , and he would come up to Long Beach , and he was there for a TED dinner .
he didn &apos;t know he was polio ; we didn &apos;t know it was the world .
and that &apos;s the truth of our planet . don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
we love believing lies . we all love doing that .
everyone of you eaten vitamin per morning ?
or a little bit of <unk> , or a little bit of <unk> , just ate the feelings that were awake .
and the reason why you do this is because half the Americans every day do this .
they &apos;ll eat this , and they &apos;ll eat it , even though we already know that these things don &apos;t actually work .
that &apos;s what the data says .
eating them only makes you black and dark , and they can &apos;t do anything .
and if you &apos;re willing to spend billions of dollars , you &apos;re going to get some black urine , some dark urine .
I was not averse .
it &apos;s the black urine , the dark side .
why do we do that ? why ?
and I thought maybe I could understand that . we have a lot of medicine in this country .
and we all hate big government , because we don &apos;t trust people in that .
but we don &apos;t have to do that . our healthcare system is so dreadful .
that &apos;s a cruel system for millions of people .
and for those who can afford to pay , it &apos;s also a form of <unk> and ruthless medical system .
so we wanted to get away from that system . where do we get away ?
we put a huge amount of effort into placebo .
this is a wonderful thing , and I love placebo .
but you know , it &apos;s a serious thing because it &apos;s a <unk> thing , but we &apos;re <unk> the billions of dollars to buy placebo .
I have all kinds of samples here .
none of them work , whether it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all of which I don &apos;t even know what it is , but we spend billions of dollars buying them , which is deception .
but you know what ? when I was talking about this , people scream at me . they would say , &quot; Well , you know , what &apos;s wrong with you ! let people choose their own choice . &quot;
eating placebo at least produces people &apos;s hearts ! &quot;
you know ? you &apos;re wrong .
I &apos;m not going to give it up . if the American Health minister of the United States and the public minister said , &quot; That &apos;s the evidence that experts have found on breast X @-@ drawn , &quot; or the evidence that a cancer <unk> wants to cure his patient by coffee .
if you believe that belief and magic is not evidence and science , you end up going to a place where you don &apos;t want to go .
maybe you will eventually become the former leaders of South Africa .
he insisted to believe that <unk> and <unk> are more effective than we know about AIDS , more effective for treating HIV than 400,000 people .
thousands of people who didn &apos;t die were dying , and that &apos;s where the biggest HIV infection in the world .
don &apos;t tell me that these examples aren &apos;t going to happen .
and the consequences are yes , always there .
now , the most ignorance epidemic we &apos;ve encountered is the result of genetically engineered crops and <unk> <unk> between the two camps .
it &apos;s also a stupid argument . we have to stop that argument .
because arguments are just words and metaphor .
it &apos;s about ideology , not about scientific arguments .
every single thing that we have in our stomach , every <unk> , every <unk> , every single <unk> , was changed by Brussels <unk> .
because there were no orange in the garden .
there &apos;s no <unk> .
there &apos;s no Christmas trees . it &apos;s all made @-@ up .
humans have made these things in the last few thousand years .
some trials succeeded , some fail .
the ones that failed attempt were falling apart .
and now we can do trials in a much more precise way , and that &apos;s certainly risky , but we can put vitamin A in a rice gene , which will save millions of lives , or extension their life .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
I just said , I don &apos;t understand that .
many of us are against genetically engineered food .
why ?
and the reason I often hear is that there &apos;s so many chemistry , too many pesticides , too many hormones , testosterone , hormones , and the reason why we don &apos;t really want the same crops that produce the same crop , that &apos;s bad .
we don &apos;t want businesses to patents new crops .
we also didn &apos;t want a large company <unk> .
can you guess the response to those objections ?
well , guess right , let &apos;s come up and solve these problems .
OK , we had a very serious food problem , but it &apos;s not science .
because it &apos;s not science .
this is the issue of law , ethics , patent law .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
not even an idea , it &apos;s a process .
and it &apos;s sometimes successful , sometimes failure , but because we &apos;re afraid that we shouldn &apos;t have scientists go and learn to do something that &apos;s horrible , and it &apos;s going to cause millions of people to flourish .
in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to need to grow 70 percent more food than today .
this is the total investment we &apos;ve spent the last 30 years in Africa .
it was embarrassing .
people there need this , but we don &apos;t .
why ? because of genetically engineered food .
we didn &apos;t encourage people to eat the wrong food , such as the wrong rice .
five million people in the world are living on cassava .
that &apos;s a crop as compared to the potatoes .
it &apos;s just calories , it tastes bad .
there &apos;s no nutrition , there &apos;s no protein , there &apos;s now scientists trying to add that to the cassava .
and when you eat those amazingly @-@ extinct humans , you can avoid it .
it &apos;s not going to starve .
that &apos;s good . it &apos;s not as good as a luxury , but it &apos;s good .
I can only tell you why some people are against this ?
ask yourself : why are we against this ?
because don &apos;t we want to move the genome ?
this is just moving some genomes , nothing related to adding chemicals .
it &apos;s not about hormones . we always wanted to get larger food , better food , more <unk> food .
it &apos;s not a meter @-@ wide display ; it &apos;s just trying to get some lives to live , and it &apos;s time we really understand what that means .
you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , but stick with what we &apos;re going to do right now , we &apos;re going to come to the future because something we don &apos;t want to happen to it , and that &apos;s going to be a high @-@ tech <unk> introduced .
no other word is more appropriate to describe this .
this is selfish , dirty , doing this just reducing our dignity , and we have to stop doing that .
all right , and after a very interesting conversation , you might say , you know , you &apos;re going to walk into this machine all the time , and right towards the future ?
and of course . I certainly will .
the machine is still today , but we have a great opportunity .
we can set up any time machine .
and we can go there , and we can go where we really want to go .
we need to start having conversations like this , and we need to think , when we enter the time and the future , we will be thrilled about our choices .
I believe that we can , and that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
all right .
I was interested in a fairly good deal for a while , usually a magician isn &apos;t interested in a placebo , but if you think from my career , that &apos;s what makes something fake real , it becomes something that people believe that they become a reality .
in other words , what you can measure in a number of studies is the result of placebo <unk> , because people think that what happens to them is a drug , or give you an example of what the patient believes is a drug injection , and there &apos;s clearly a placebo effect on them .
fake things become real because people understand it .
and in order to understand each other , I want to start showing you a very simple , simple magic .
and I &apos;m going to tell you how I became . it was a simple magic that came out of every child in the &apos; 50s .
I learned it in the &apos; 70s by the magic child child soldiers .
I &apos;ll show you first , and I &apos;ll explain it again .
and finally I &apos;ll explain why I want to explain .
see , how that became magic .
this knife , you can examine ; my hand , you can examine it .
and I just stuck in my fist .
and then I brush my sleeve up .
and it also made sure that nothing could go up and down on my sleeve , and that &apos;s my wrist .
and then you can see there &apos;s no time for anything , and as long as I can tell you , there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve .
and the goal is simple .
I &apos;m going to open my palm in my hand , and if everything &apos;s going well , my biological magnetic attraction will stick to this knife .
in fact , it &apos;s so tight that I can even shake the knife .
there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , no trick . you can look at everything .
all right !
well , it &apos;s a magic trick that I often like to teach kids about magic , because you learn a lot about deception by learning about this magic -- even though it &apos;s a very simple magic approach .
many of you probably know this magic .
it happened .
I had this knife in my hand .
I said I had to hold my wrist to make sure there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , which is a lie .
and the reason I held my wrist is the secret of the hand .
and as I move from your hand to your hand to your fingertips , this fingers , and my points of thumb are going to come from here to point to the location .
okay .
there were a lot of people sitting there who hadn &apos;t seen a childhood .
and that &apos;s how my fingers moved from here , right .
I &apos;m turning my hand around , and my fingers are moving .
we can talk about why this is a liar , and why you don &apos;t see only three fingers underneath here , because your mind , and the way we process consciousness , it &apos;s not computing one , two , three . it &apos;s <unk> .
but that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to talk about today . right ? I &apos;m going to open up my palm again .
obviously it &apos;s lined up there , not through any physiological magnet , but through deception , my <unk> is there .
and I <unk> my finger again , and again , after I <unk> it , it sort of <unk> my fingers .
hands the hand . you pull out the knife .
this trick you can do with your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with a placebo ?
I read a study about a year ago , and it opened my perception .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this was a surprising thing for me .
it shows that if you give a placebo in a form of orange pills , like aspirin , if it &apos;s a circle white pill , it has some measurable results .
but if you change the shape of a placebo shape , like if you turn it into a small pill , and paint it in blue , and it creates a letter in blue , it actually makes a much more obvious measurement .
even though none of them have any real medicine -- they &apos;re all <unk> .
but the white pills are the ones that don &apos;t have blue .
what ? it really confused me .
but in fact , that &apos;s not the end .
if you take the capsule , they work more than any of these .
there &apos;s the color capsule , there &apos;s yellow at the end , and the red one on the other is more effective than the white capsule .
the dose was done .
once twice a day , a piece of data didn &apos;t work . I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m sorry .
but the point is .
the dose is about medicine .
<unk> form and medicine are about .
if you want to get a placebo at the right level , you need an injection of <unk> .
right ? one or two <unk> of a syringe , you inject it into a patient .
in their mind , this was such a powerful idea that it should be better than a white pill .
it &apos;s a very strong imagination , and when I have the slide slide , I can show you the statistics .
the point is that white pills don &apos;t have blue pills ; there &apos;s no <unk> .
they &apos;re not really medicine . it &apos;s just your belief that making it real in your body , and it makes it more robust .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to magic tricks .
some clearly a fake trick made it look real .
we know from the study that if you want to have a baby , you take an <unk> .
this is a <unk> cap . it &apos;s pretty cool . I &apos;m going to fry it .
this is my muscle . this is not a muscle .
that &apos;s my skin . it &apos;s not Hollywood special effects .
and I &apos;m going to dive into my skin and pull this needle across to the other side .
if you &apos;re easy to be nervous -- if you &apos;re easy to play -- I showed some friends yesterday in the hotel , and some people I didn &apos;t know , there was a woman almost thousand times left .
so , I &apos;d suggest that if you &apos;re easy to watch elsewhere in the next 30 seconds , actually , you know what , I &apos;m going to do the bad things behind it .
you &apos;ll see , you can see elsewhere if you want .
well , that &apos;s what happened , right here in my lower hand of my arm , I made a little hole in the bottom .
sorry . am I scared of you ?
and I went through my skin a little bit on the other side .
now , we &apos;re basically in the same position as a knife .
pretty much .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers now , right ?
so let me show them . one , two , three , four , five .
yes , oh .
I know what people want when they see this .
and they said , oh , he &apos;s not going to break his skin and play it for a few minutes .
so let me peek at you .
so what does that look like ? good .
yeah , I know .
and the people in the back said , &quot; OK . I didn &apos;t really see that . I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
the people in the remote room are now available .
let me show you this .
this is actually my skin . this is not Hollywood special effects .
that &apos;s my meat , and I can turn it around .
sorry . if you feel disgust , look elsewhere , forget this .
and the person in the back , or a few years later , looked at this from the video and said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a little bit missing effect , but if it &apos;s real , there &apos;s a hole , and there &apos;s a hole , if it &apos;s real bleed .
let me give you some blood .
yes , that &apos;s it .
normally I would take the needle out .
I would wash my arms and show you I didn &apos;t get hurt .
but I think that in this case , the idea of <unk> becomes something real , and I &apos;m going to stop here and walk down the stage .
I &apos;m going to see you in the next few days .
I want you to hope . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about pleasure recently .
over the last five years , I &apos;ve asked the number of people in recent years to mention the pleasures of the book , and they count about 40 , and there &apos;s so much more to it .
more and more researchers today are starting to be interested in happiness .
and there &apos;s a lot of them who are happy coaches .
making other people happy is their goal .
and while this kind of work is still part of a cognitive trap , these trap will increase the difficulty of happiness .
I &apos;m going to primarily talk about these cognitive <unk> today .
these trap effects affect the way people think about themselves , and they affect the truths of scholars to be happy , because of the fact that we all make a mistake .
the first trap is the complexity of happiness .
as it turns out , pleasure is no longer a word of words anymore , because we have so much to interpret .
I think we should define what it means , but generally , we have to give up this idea and , in a more complex way , the pleasant life .
the second trap is a mixed association between experience and memory : that basically it &apos;s the difference between the pleasure and the experience of life and the difference between your life .
and they &apos;re both very miles away , and when they &apos;re having a good time .
the third trap is the illusion , unfortunately , whenever we think about something about pleasure , we feel very important .
I mean , it &apos;s a real cognitive trap .
it &apos;s <unk> .
now , I want to start with an example of an example of a personal <unk> that I told a story about in <unk> <unk> <unk> -- &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; who said that he had a great music when he was listening to a symphony , but at the end of the performance , the <unk> and the <unk> voices came out .
and then he was so excited that this was a mouse that got sick .
but it wasn &apos;t .
the awful image of what happened was just the memory of that experience .
he experienced this experience .
and he &apos;s been through 20 minutes of hearing transistors .
but now it &apos;s a little bit smaller now , because the <unk> left a memory ; it &apos;s that terrible memory , and the other 20 @-@ minute prizes are completely forgotten .
and that tells us that we have two selves when we think about ourselves and other people .
the first one is self @-@ experience , and it &apos;s a self that lives at the moment , and it &apos;s brought back to the past , but basically he &apos;s only the present .
what happens when the doctor comes to the experience -- as the doctor asked you , does it touch me when you touch you here ?
another self is a memory , and he &apos;s in charge of his life , and he &apos;s in charge of his life , and he &apos;s looking for him , and he asks him , &quot; How recently do they feel ? &quot;
or do you want to go to Italy or something like that ?
experience self and memory are a very different part of why we don &apos;t understand pleasure .
memory itself is responsible for telling stories .
and the stories come from memories -- instant upload them .
not the stories we &apos;re telling .
it &apos;s our memories tell stories about the stories that we stored in our experience .
let me start with an example .
this is an ancient study .
some real patients are going to adopt a pain treatment .
details go back to details . the therapies of today are no longer true anymore , but in the 90s of the study , this is a terrible solution .
every six seconds the patient has to report their pain index .
here are two patients . this is their record .
and I asked you , who was the most suffering in them ?
it &apos;s simple .
clearly , the patient &apos;s B. his <unk> has a long time , and the patient has a half a minute , and B feels the same , and it &apos;s continuing .
but there &apos;s another question : do these patients think they &apos;re suffering ?
here &apos;s a little accident .
and the amazing thing is that the patient &apos;s memory of a tree is worse than the patient or B.
the story of two meters is different , and the end of the story is the gap .
both stories don &apos;t spark intelligence at all -- but obviously they &apos;re different ...
obviously one of them felt worse than another .
it felt worse , and it was the last time in the last period to know what it was , not a good story .
how did we know that ?
because we asked them at the end of the examination , and we asked them once again over a long time , what do you think of as the whole thing as a <unk> as you &apos;ve seen ?
it turns out that A &apos;s memory feels worse than B.
now this is a direct conflict between self and memory itself .
from an experience of self @-@ experience , the patient B is obviously difficult .
so what the patient A &apos;s explanation for is that we actually did a clinical trial , and when the experiment finished , we got the result , and in fact , we could actually extend that patient &apos;s time span A &apos;s time to slow down the machinery .
the patient still hurts , but it &apos;s a lot .
and if you continue this way , you &apos;re going to make the patient &apos;s experience worse , but the memory of the patient &apos;s A &apos;s is better , because you give the patient a better story , a good memory of his experience .
how do you define good stories ?
and the memories tell us the story is real , and the stories we tell are true .
the good news is it takes a few hours to end .
and the ending is very important , and the story on it is led by the end .
now , experience itself as a result of that experience .
he had a moment of experience , one after another .
and you ask the question : what &apos;s wrong with all this ? what &apos;s wrong ?
and the answer is simple . they disappear forever .
most of the time that we live in -- I &apos;ll give you a second round of time -- just three seconds from psychology . that means there &apos;s about three times in your life , there &apos;s about a month , about a month , about a month , and they don &apos;t leave the trail left behind .
most of them are fully self @-@ contained .
and yet , you &apos;re now finding that some of the feelings are stored , because every moment in our experience lies upon us .
as long as we &apos;re alive , we &apos;ll consume these limited resources .
how to use them seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the only story that the memory has left us .
so memory itself and experience are great .
the biggest difference between them is how they handle time .
as an experience , if you have a holiday , the first week is as happy as the first week of the week , the amount of joy that comes out of the week is twice the amount of stolen .
and that &apos;s not how memory itself works .
it &apos;s more than a week of <unk> for a week , because there &apos;s no new memories coming in .
it &apos;s a quick movie .
so time is the key ingredient for self @-@ expression and experience , and time is not big for the story .
what memory self does is not just memory and tell stories .
and it &apos;s what really makes a difference , because if your patient had been through two different surgeons doing different procedures , and now decided to take a check from one of them , the patient &apos;s choices would feel better than the memory , and that &apos;s how the doctor chooses .
experience itself is making choices and learning is healing .
in fact , we don &apos;t make choices between two experiences ; we make choices in two different experiences .
and when we think about the future , we don &apos;t typically think in the form of experience .
we &apos;re going to present the future in memories .
and by and large , you can see that memory itself is a tyrant , you can imagine that memory itself is pulling out of the experience , and he is the experience of self @-@ experiences by himself .
I had an idea that , as we were closed , there was a big part of it for memory .
I think that &apos;s a little bit of a fuss about .
how much memory do we use ?
this explains why memory itself can be the dominant self .
it reminded me of a vacation I spent a couple of years at the South Pole , which is one of my great <unk> , and I often think of this vacation more than any other vacation .
and it took me about a three @-@ week trip , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , as I turned on the gate of around 600 photographs , I might take an hour to remember .
three weeks of the week &apos;s worth of memory .
it seemed to be out of sync .
and it was a little bit uncomfortable , because I remember it was a little bit too small , but even if you remember that there would be a real problem , why do we use memory more than we rely on our experiences ?
so I want you to think about an experiment about thinking .
if you take your next vacation , if you know the end of the vacation , all of the images will be destroyed , and you will also be relieved of a drug for you to forget .
did you think about the same vacation ?
if you took a different kind of vacation between your two self @-@ ego , you had to think about that conflict , and it wasn &apos;t easy , because if you only had time you had an answer , but if you just had another answer .
why don &apos;t we just choose between the two selves , the question that bothers us is the choice between two selves .
now , two different ideas about pleasure .
these two ideas of happiness corresponds to two selves .
so you ask yourself : how happy is it to be for yourself ?
and then you ask yourself , &quot; How happy is the instant of the experience of yourself ? &quot;
these moments of joy are complex .
how does emotion measure ?
by the way , we now have a rough idea of self @-@ experience as time is given .
and the memories of the self are completely irrelevant .
it &apos;s not a question of how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s a question of how fulfilling and how much love it is .
radically different perceptions .
and if you can &apos;t tell these two different insights , there &apos;s no sense of pleasure , and I &apos;ve been as happy as any other student that I &apos;ve been around for a long time , because of that .
and in recent years , the difference between self @-@ experience and memory , the difference between the present self and the present , is figuring out the two .
and the Gallup Organization recently ran a survey all over the world , and over half a million people were asking a question like this , which is how they looked at their lives and how they looked at their experience , except for this question , this company did other surveys .
in recent years , we &apos;ve learned about two great insights .
and I think the main lesson that we learned is that it &apos;s the same .
even though you can tell you how happy a person is about their life , it doesn &apos;t tell you how happy they are , and vice versa .
just to give you a basic idea of the connection , they &apos;re about 50 percent related .
that means when you meet someone , you &apos;re told that his father has a high cell phone number , can you know how tall this person is ?
well , you might have a basic idea , but it &apos;s pretty uncertain .
you can &apos;t determine .
if I say somebody has a quality of their life , he plays eight / 10 , and you can &apos;t grasp how happy their experience is .
so the connection is low .
we know what makes people happy .
we know that money is important , the goal is important .
we know that happiness needs to be fulfilled by the people we love , the time and the people that stayed with them .
there are other factors , but that &apos;s the main factor .
so if you want to make both of them happy , you have to throw away something different .
I mean , at least shouldn &apos;t be as good as happiness .
these are the differences .
now , very quickly talking about another reason why we can &apos;t understand pleasure is fundamentally different from how we see life and how we live .
so when you ask people in California how happy are , you &apos;re not going to get the right answer .
because when you think that way , you think it &apos;s a little bit pleasant , and you live in Ohio .
when you &apos;re thinking about how happy it is in California , you think of the differences between California and other <unk> , like , climate .
it turns out that the climate conditions aren &apos;t important , and it doesn &apos;t matter how happy it is to think about ourselves .
but since reality is dominated by thinking about self @-@ direction , some people might have come to the conclusion that it &apos;s moved to California .
they moved to California for a more happy life , and they were tracking what was going to be a pretty interesting thing .
their experience is not going to be happier .
we all know that .
but one of the things that happened was that they thought they were happy because they were thinking about the state of Ohio , and they felt that they made the right decision .
it &apos;s really hard to understand pleasure , and I hope I &apos;ve given you a basic idea of how hard it is to understand this process .
thank you .
thank you . I have a question to ask you .
thank you very much for your talk .
a few weeks ago , we had a telephone in a couple of weeks ago , and you heard an interesting phenomenon that you had discovered from the Gallup poll .
can you share it with us ? we have a couple of minutes .
Daniel Libeskind : okay .
and I found a very intriguing number from the Gallup world that I &apos;d found in the Gallup Journal that was unexpected .
we found a phenomenon about self @-@ experience .
that &apos;s how much people feel about their income changes .
and it turns out that for Americans who are less than half a year @-@ olds in the United States , that &apos;s a substantial amount of samples , almost six million of these people , these people are quite modest , and these are more than $ 600,000 ...
that &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
people who earn less than a year are less happy , and they &apos;re happier than they are .
and over 60,000 dollars , we get a standard horizontal line .
it &apos;s a very nice time to see these flat lines .
obviously money can &apos;t afford to buy a sense of self @-@ experience , but it does not have money to give you an extraordinary amount of status , and we know the degree of suffering , and it &apos;s very clear .
for another self , memory itself , you have a story of healing .
the more you make , the more you get .
it &apos;s nothing to do with emotion .
but life and freedom and pleasure are the goal of all Americans struggle .
if you all look at that carefully , it &apos;s going to turn our ideas into things like <unk> policies and so on .
is there any political people in this country ever going to see this as a result and a billion dollars ?
<unk> : I think there &apos;s a sense of what pleasure is about .
but it was an idea that was too late in the United States , and it &apos;s not obvious , but it &apos;s in the U.K. , and it &apos;s contributing to the rest of the world .
and you start to realize that when you add happiness to policy , you start thinking about pleasure as well .
and while this is going to take a moment , people are starting to think about it , and what they want is the pleasure of experience or the evaluation of life , so quickly we &apos;re going to understand this .
it &apos;s a way of <unk> happiness , but there &apos;s a couple of different ways of what you think , and what you think about is that memory is still about self @-@ experience .
and I think it will affect policy within a few years .
America has paid a tremendous amount of effort to measure the well @-@ being of human experience .
I think in the next decade or two , this will be part of the country &apos;s statistic .
this issue is going to be the most strategic policy issue in the next few years .
thank you very much for creating behavioral economics .
thank you very much , Daniel <unk> .
my name is <unk> . I &apos;m a game designer .
I &apos;ve been working on online games for 10 years , and the goal of the next decade is to be able to ask questions like game play .
now , the reason I &apos;m going to explain why I &apos;m saying this is that if people have bigger and bigger games , and of course all of you in this room , and spend a lot more time playing games , you think that I &apos;m more persuasive than that .
people have been online today for about three billion hours a week , and people are playing online for three billion hours a week .
some of you may think that games spend so much time playing games .
maybe there &apos;s a lot more , because there &apos;s a lot of pressing problems that we need to deal with .
but , according to the research that I have in the future , we spend a little bit less time playing games .
three billion hours a week in the world , less than three billion hours a week in real life , games are far beyond the problems of real life .
in fact , I felt that in order to live on a better life on Earth , in fact , I felt that in order to live on Earth , we needed a lot of games to increase the time .
I &apos;ve been computing , and the time that we need is <unk> billion hours per week .
maybe it &apos;s counterintuitive , but I want to repeat it all , so it &apos;s understandable that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , obesity , obesity , I believe that we need to be encouraged to play online every week , at least 10 years , that &apos;s going to happen .
well , I &apos;m serious . I &apos;m not kidding .
and here &apos;s the explanation , and that &apos;s why games are important for human races in the future . it &apos;s true .
this is a portrait taken by <unk> .
he wanted to capture some of the changes in the video games , so he put them in front of the game players .
this is a classic expression of a player .
now , if you &apos;re not a game player , you &apos;re not going to be the real meaning of that image .
you might feel that pressing , pressing fear , not mental <unk> , or concentrate , is solving a problem .
if you &apos;re a game player , you feel a bunch of different things around the corner of the corner , including the wrinkles around the corner of the <unk> around the corner , and that &apos;s a very optimistic sign , and it &apos;s a sign of the eyebrow .
this suggests that this game is about to get epic performance in the game .
you &apos;ve heard the word &quot; good , &quot; which means some of you have been a player .
this epic victory is a result , but it &apos;s very exciting , and before you even think of it , it &apos;s successful .
it &apos;s even beyond your imagination .
and once you get there , you &apos;re struck by the skills of your own skills , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called the <unk> epic .
and this player is about to win like this .
and in the meantime , this is what we want to do with all of the problems around the world , and the people that come out of all the obstacles are the perpetrators of <unk> .
now , unfortunately , when we deal with the <unk> of daily life , what we often see is this expression of expression .
usually I call this an <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> life @-@ making experience , and it &apos;s actually the kind of thing I make out of it . okay .
and that &apos;s the kind of <unk> that I made that I was not good at living in the expressions of my life .
and this is also an old community in Berkeley , California , an old community in my Ph.D. in art , and I read a Ph.D. from a Ph.D. in Ph.D. &apos; s topics , which is why we feel that virtual reality is better than the real world .
and it &apos;s also a huge puzzle for many players .
we feel like we can &apos;t adapt to real life in games .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s successful ; both are not part of the <unk> on a par .
we do have a lot more success in the world , but here &apos;s what we call an inherent motivation , the motivation , the collaborative inspiration and collaborative inspiration .
when we were in the world , I felt that we could do the best of ourselves , and as a message , we would come to help others and solve a problem of <unk> , that we would be brave enough to stand up and continue on .
but in real life , when we &apos;re confronted with failure , when we &apos;re confronted with failure , we usually feel that .
we tend to think that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have a game during that time , and we didn &apos;t feel it in the game .
and that &apos;s what I studied when I was a graduate student .
can games make us feel , can &apos;t we do anything ?
how can we get that sense of being able to move that sense of being a game into a real society ?
so I looked at some of the games like World of Warcraft , and they were the ideal testing of collaborative issues .
and I noticed something about these things that makes epic play possible in online play .
the first thing is , whenever you show up in these online games , especially World of Warcraft games have a lot of different characters in which they trust you very much , and they help you to save the world .
but not all of the tasks are like this , and it &apos;s just the ones that match your current level .
so you have the power to do it .
designers don &apos;t give you a mission that you can &apos;t do right now .
but finishing this task requires your ability to limit , so you have to do everything you can to , and in World of Warcraft , everybody has their own position .
there &apos;s not an audience that has always been something very special and important to wait for you to do it .
and there &apos;s a lot of people in the world who can work together .
everywhere you go , there will be thousands and thousands of people waiting to be working with you to do these huge tasks .
in real life , there was no easy feedback between all the thousands of partners we &apos;ve had at our fingertips in real life .
there &apos;s a wonderful thing about games , and the plot draws us , and it motivates what we do .
and at the same time , there &apos;s a positive response for any effort we &apos;ve made .
you &apos;ve heard about the rise of the order , along with the level of the hierarchy , add up to the level of intelligence .
and we don &apos;t have that sustainable feedback in real life .
for example , when I was walking down this stage , I wouldn &apos;t have the ability to speak up , the crazy ideas , the crazy ideas , and let alone 20 add up to 20 ideas .
in real life , I didn &apos;t get any rewards .
in a network of networks , like World of Warcraft , for example , World of Warcraft and others are a very <unk> thing , because we can continue to win the final triumph of World of Warcraft , and that &apos;s because we will be so trapped in the world .
because it &apos;s better than reality .
so far , since the World War II game game players have spent billions of years trying to solve all of the virtual problems that are being asked to solve all of the virtual problems in Western World War I.
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
but it sounds like a bad thing .
and we wrote these numbers , and our ancestors evolved upright 10,000 years ago .
this is the first primate that walked upright .
so when we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend on games , the only way that makes this reasonable understanding is : think about how much time we &apos;ve spent on the evolution of human evolution , and how remarkable it is .
and to think that &apos;s right , because what you &apos;re going to see is that , by spending a lot of time playing games , we &apos;re going to be able to change our ability to be human .
we &apos;re moving forward to becoming a more collaborative spirit and robust species .
it &apos;s true . I believe it .
this is an interesting survey , a recent survey , published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon from the Carnegie Mellon University in an atmosphere where young people are playing in an atmosphere , a country where today &apos;s 21 years old , average people spend 10,000 hours on average every single online game .
now , 10,000 hours is an interesting value because there are two reasons .
first of all , children from grade five to high school took an hour to high school , and of course you had to do well on time .
and we had a parallel survey data which showed that young people made a good game player spend as much time learning as they spent in school .
some of you must have read the latest book , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so your insights about success are not that strange , 10,000 hours of success .
the law is based on cognitive science , and if we spend 10,000 hours in the age of 21 , we can do something else , and then we must have a great success in these things .
we &apos;re going to be the world @-@ world expert on anything we do .
now , what we &apos;re looking at is the full generation of young people who are playing .
the biggest question is , what are the players doing ? what are the players doing ?
if we can give the answers , we &apos;re going to give an unprecedented human resource .
they are the ones that we have today that spend at least an hour every day playing online game players .
they were all brilliant ; they were wonderful ; they were 500 million people who were good at something .
and in the next 10 years , there are a billion people who are really good at some kind of game players coming in .
if you haven &apos;t heard about it , then I tell you , it &apos;s happening .
the game industry has been evolving for a long time , and since this time , it has moved from the Internet to the wireless network of mobile phone networks , especially players from India , China , Brazil , Brazil , all the players in the same platform .
in the next decade , there will be a billion new players in the next decade .
we had 15 game players .
so I started early thinking , where are these games going to lead us ?
and I think there are four things about this : the first is the positive of <unk> , the optimistic about security .
think of it as something of an inspiring ego .
and the great optimism is that bringing yourself back to the desire to solve obstacles immediately .
the game players always believe that the winning of failures is possible .
the gamers are not isolated .
they were pretty good at creating social structures .
an interesting investigation shows that we prefer people who play with us , even though they beat me up , that &apos;s the same .
and the reason for that is that we accumulate trust in the game , and that &apos;s why we create trust in the game .
the reason why we trust that is because they spend the same time with the same rules that we spend with , we &apos;re going to fight side @-@ by @-@ side until the game is over .
and based on this , games really can create a synthesis of shared and trust and collaboration .
and we &apos;re going to create a more robust social network .
the productivity of happiness , I love that .
the World of Warcraft players , on average , spend 22 hours a week playing games as part @-@ time games .
it &apos;s because when we play games , when we &apos;re having a games of leisure or leisure , we &apos;re having a lot more fun .
as humans , we prefer to do things that are difficult , but interesting .
if you could give a reasonable task to the player , they would just keep playing .
and finally , what is epic .
the game players like to carry on in the work of great tales of human beings .
any little bit of routine that you &apos;ve done will be part of that final vision that you &apos;ve all heard about Wikipedia , the biggest <unk> around the world , the world &apos;s biggest <unk> , the world &apos;s biggest <unk> .
the second largest <unk> in the world , &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; has about 80,000 articles in it .
every month , 500 million people are using it .
there &apos;s more information about World of Warcraft than any other topic on the Internet .
and this creates a live story .
and it was also a great science of &quot; World of Warcraft . &quot;
and that &apos;s what brings those four superpowers to an example of the game players are a highly licensed , hopeful community .
they all think they have the ability to change the world , and they all think they have the capacity to change the world .
but the problem is that they believe they can change the world , not the real world .
and that &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist named <unk> <unk> .
his job was brilliant . he studied why people spend so much time and energy and money online games .
he said , &quot; We &apos;re seeing a lot of people who live in virtual and online play . &quot;
because he was an economist , he was rational .
and he said ...
unlike me , I &apos;m just a game designer , and I &apos;m full of energy .
and he also said that play has become more useful because players have more things in the virtual world than in real life .
they have better social relations in the game , and they have better returns and fulfilled than real life .
so he said that for the game players , spend more time in the virtual world than it is for the real world .
now I still think that &apos;s rational .
but anyway , that &apos;s not the best option .
we have to start building from the present , as a game .
so I got inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
these are old dice , made out of sheep &apos;s joints .
before we &apos;ve designed the game controller , we humans have had dice for sheep joints .
this is the earliest game equipment ever devised .
if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient Greek historians , like the Greek historian , you will understand what the history of this history is and why .
the game was , in particular , the night dice were invented by the great <unk> of the dice .
obviously , there had been this terrible famine in history , and the king decided to do something crazy that they had to do .
people were suffering and fighting each other .
the form of crisis . they need an extreme solution .
they invented the dice , according to Stephen Hawking &apos;s game and created a policy across the country , and one day , all of us could eat , but the next day , everybody could play the game .
people are playing dice because games are fascinating and attractive for us to sink our happiness in such a self @-@ fulfilling act , people forget about the fact that they don &apos;t have food .
the next day , the next day people are going to play games , and the next day they &apos;re going to eat .
and it was said by the way that the people of the <unk> have spent 18 years eating the food , playing games , and they were able to spend a great deal of their lives .
and that &apos;s how we see games today .
we are suffering from games .
we &apos;ve gone through games to get away from the reality of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the things that we need .
and this process can be done forever .
this is very exciting .
according to August , after 18 years , the great famine had no improvement , no positive signs , so the king decided to play the last night game in the country .
he divided the country on average two groups .
they all play the winners of a dice game of dice , and the winners of a cycle of adventure .
they &apos;re going to go out and find a new place to stay alive , and the people that are left out of the wild are going to spread , the burden of the civilization , the burden of the civilization .
it sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but recently , recent DNA evidence shows the ancestors of the Roman Empire and the same genes .
and scientists have recently discovered the crazy story , which has historically happened .
and geologists also found evidence that there was a global cooling off for 20 years on Earth , which explains this great famine .
so this seemingly crazy story is real .
they passed games and saved their culture and saved their culture for 18 years , and eventually they were able to survive , and they were able to bring people together , and they were able to save the entire civilization of civilization through the game .
we can do it in this way .
people were playing World of Warcraft in 1994 .
this is the first real @-@ time game in World of Warcraft , 16 years ago .
the <unk> played dice for 18 years , and we played World of Warcraft .
so I suppose we &apos;re ready to accept a game that can change our lives .
one half of all civilization &apos;s civilization is pursued by one half of our civilization to look for the new world , and we &apos;re now playing games every six billion hours .
half of us play games every day for an hour until we can solve real @-@ life problems .
you might ask , how can we solve reality in games , and that &apos;s why I &apos;ve spent the last couple of years focusing on what I &apos;ve been doing in the work that I &apos;ve been working on in the last few years called the <unk> Institute for the future .
this is an ad that we ran in an office building that gave us a sense of how we think about the future .
we &apos;re not going to try to predict the future .
but we &apos;re going to create the future .
we had imagined the best possible results , and we wanted to see that by trying to make them happen .
we crave the epic triumph , and we gave people the opportunity to win .
I want to give you a quick clip of what I &apos;m doing , and they &apos;re all attempts and trying to give the future of people to create their own epic performance , some ways of doing it .
this is &quot; The <unk> World . &quot;
and this was made in 2007 .
this is a game play ; it gives you a sense of the lack of oil .
the lack of oil is fiction , but we &apos;re going to spend a lot of this in it , and you think that &apos;s true , and it affects your real life in real life , and we don &apos;t have the oil riots , so when you open the game and tell us what &apos;s happening , we &apos;re going to give you real @-@ time data and tell you exactly what &apos;s happening .
in 2007 , there were 17 thousand people tested this game , and we followed those people for the next three years .
and I can tell you that this was a very revolutionary experience .
no one wants to change their way of life , or because they think that &apos;s right for the environment , or because they feel that reason .
but if you had them immersed in an amazing experience and told them , we &apos;d run out of our oil .
it &apos;s going to be a wonderful story you &apos;ve heard about and an amazing experience .
challenge yourself , to see how most of the games that you &apos;re going to survive , have the majority of the players that they &apos;re making in the game , the majority of the players that are playing with the game .
in the next game of saving the world , our choice was more difficult than the lack of oil .
we made a game called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and we made a game called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and we made a game called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the premise of this game is , supercomputers have spent 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputers is called the <unk> projection system .
people were playing in a game like Jerry <unk> &apos;s movie .
you know , you all know about Jerry &apos;s movies , you organized an <unk> family , you had astronauts and scientists and ex @-@ scientists and some of the skills of saving the world .
in the game that we designed , we didn &apos;t have the five team of five , we designed to be one of the four members of the elite , and your mission was to develop the future of energy , food , health care , all social security .
we have 8,000 people playing this game for eight weeks .
they summarize 500 crazy solutions , but creative solutions , and if you can go online and log to Google <unk> , you can see the result .
the last game we &apos;re going to do is put it in March <unk> , which is a game done with the World Bank .
if you can do that , you will get the <unk> of the World Bank of the World Bank of 2010 .
by working with sub @-@ Saharan Africa , we &apos;re inviting them to participate in social innovation .
games are more like a cartoon fiction . we have an equilibrium in skill , such as deep learning , knowledge , bandwidth , vision , etc .
I invite all of you to actually share this game with the young people everywhere in the world , especially in the developing world , and that game allows people to focus , to start thinking about their own social enterprises , to save the world .
I &apos;m going to end my talk .
I want to ask a question .
what &apos;s going to happen in the future ?
we have so many wonderful games that we play in these games may be the kind of trials that we &apos;re going to do in the future , but nothing has ever saved .
and I hope you will agree with me that the player is a huge human @-@ powered <unk> , and we can get them to work in the real world because of that , the game is a revolution .
we have all these wonderful superpowers , the productivity of happiness , the ability of organized social structure and immediate optimism and an appetite for epic beauty .
and I would like to honestly hope that we can all play with the good games of the next century on this planet .
I want you to join us in making or supporting games like this .
when I look forward to the next decade , I &apos;m pretty sure two things are , first of all , we can create any future we can imagine , and second , we can play any game we want to play with .
let &apos;s start changing the world .
thank you .
I want to share with you a couple of months ago one of the biggest discoveries I was working on as an Italian magazine article .
when I was writing , I was always stuck with the dictionary , and I was writing the article out , and I realized that I had never looked for a hundred or more disabled people in the dictionary .
let me read this out for you .
the forensic <unk> of all disabled , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , destruction , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , messy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , mental disabilities , <unk> , <unk> mental , <unk> , <unk> mental , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
conversely , it &apos;s robust , it &apos;s capable .
and I read it to a friend of mine , and at first I was laughing at it , and it was ridiculous that when the <unk> got <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , I had to stop trying to give myself the words and the pains and feelings of shame .
yes , my old @-@ fashioned dictionaries were a little too old , and I thought , it must be an old version .
but in fact , it was in the &apos; 80s when I was supposed to be outside of the home to create a sense of my own and the world around me .
thankfully , I hadn &apos;t spent the time alone .
what I mean by that is , by <unk> the dictionary of the <unk> of the <unk> of the disabled , the world in which I live in is not accepted , as the disability world in my disability , that the physical world in our disability is completely positive today , but today I have an adventure for all of my life and the opportunities that I live in .
so I went online , and I looked at the <unk> of disabled people in 2009 , and I was looking forward to seeing some important changes .
and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a new version of the <unk> disabled .
unfortunately , the explanation wasn &apos;t much better than that .
the opposite of the other word &quot; almost twice &quot; has given me , &quot; which is , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is sound .
in fact , it &apos;s not just a few words .
when people use that negative vocabulary , it turns out that what happens is that people think about disability .
what &apos;s remarkable about this is the value of the vocabulary of the disabled , the value of the individual , and the process of that value .
our language affects our mind and the way we see the world , the way we see others .
in fact , including the ancient Greek and the Roman and the great power of many ancient societies as they say , is true .
so , what kind of thing do we want to be able to make something out of a person without the ability , or a person without the ability ?
sometimes , we just give them names for an adult or a child , but maybe we give them a shadow , give them their ability to question themselves .
don &apos;t we want to open our hearts ?
and one of my life was this man who opened the door of my heart , who was taking care of one of my doctors as a child , an A physician at the <unk> Institute of <unk> , the <unk> Institute at the <unk> Institute .
his name is <unk> <unk> , an Italian @-@ American , and obviously his name is a lot of American culture , and underneath it &apos;s called P @-@ A doctors .
the average doctor , P , has always been a <unk> , and he has a great education for his children .
in addition to training courses , I spent a lot of time in his hospital as well .
I &apos;m going to take that wet , colors , flexible tape of it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again , the breathing muscles , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again , and again ,
I was a five @-@ year @-@ old kid , and he didn &apos;t bother me , and , of course , I didn &apos;t mean it .
and one day , the P doctor in my <unk> came along to me , and I was , you know , sort of , ruthless , exhausted , and then he said to me , Amy , you &apos;re a tough girl , and I felt like you were able to pull this tape out one day .
when you broke it , I rewards you 100 dollars .
obviously , this is a trick that P @-@ A doctor for too long , but he just wanted me to do these things that I didn &apos;t love to do , and it turned out to be one of the richest people in the first five @-@ year @-@ olds in the entire hospital , but one thing that I hate to translate as a whole new , fresh , fresh , fresh experience .
today , I &apos;ve often wondered , I &apos;ve been thinking about what it would be like to be a liberal doctor , and what it would be like to be a strong young girl for me to be aware of , and now I &apos;ve learned that my inner vision is <unk> , my future , a bright future .
this is an example from a P doctor , which explains that an adult with power has the potential of a child .
but in the more recent example of the dictionary , our language failed to allow us to turn things that we want to see and not allow the disabled people to realize that they are actually capable of being able .
technology is bringing social development , and our language has not grown up as we speak .
and of course , from the medical point of view , my fake leg , repair my vision of a laser @-@ <unk> titanium surgical knee , giving birth to elderly people , all of these techniques , all of which allowed people to be more fully functional and apply them to the natural constraints of the environment , and build these social platforms for our own communities around the world .
so technology is clearly showing us a permanent truth , which is that every one of us is very powerful , and it is the ability to contribute to society , to cope with the capacities of living and well @-@ being , the greatest human capital .
talking about human adaptation , and I felt really interesting because people often want to get me to get over to the <unk> of the topic that I want to talk about today , and I want to make a little bit more sense to the point that some people don &apos;t realize , and I &apos;m starting to think about why I started thinking about this .
to get over adversity from adversity to a <unk> point of truth , which is success , or happiness is at the other end of a difficult experience , and the experience itself has nothing to do with success and pleasure , as if , the reason I &apos;ve been successful is because I &apos;ve been around a series of challenges as an amputation , some of other factors that seem to me .
but in fact , these challenges really changed us , the quality of life on our journey , which may be the body , the mental , perhaps both .
what I want to say is , it &apos;s a lovely thing to be challenging .
in adversity , we shouldn &apos;t be treating it as obstacles to continuing our lives .
in fact , adversity is part of our lives .
I was dragging adversity to my own shadow .
sometimes it looks big , sometimes very small , but it &apos;s still beside me .
of course , I &apos;m not trying to <unk> the worth and the worth of the struggles of people struggling with <unk> .
we are destined to be <unk> for a lifetime and challenging each of us , but the question that we &apos;re focusing on is not whether you &apos;re going to go to the adversity of or not , but how to deal with it .
so our responsibility is not simply to simply simply easier for the people we care about , but to make them <unk> out of adversity .
when we let our children feel that we don &apos;t have environments , we actually hurts them .
the objective of medicine , the objective truth , is whether or not I &apos;m a disabled person , think about whether or not I &apos;m a disabled person , is there a difference between the two .
in fact , the only question I have to deal with is the only question that the world has about my injustice and about describing all of my injustice .
we want to be able to protect the people we care about , and we &apos;re going to take the <unk> and diagnose them , or sometimes , predict their future lives , but we have to pay attention to whether or not what we &apos;re doing is destroy these people .
perhaps , people are used to focus only on the constraints of their own flaws and how to repair that premise of the mentally ill , more harmful effects than the physical disability alone .
we don &apos;t see disability in a whole way , and we don &apos;t accept them , and it &apos;s a difficult situation for them .
we can actually evaluate the value of a society &apos;s value effectively .
so our eyes shouldn &apos;t be limited to the <unk> of the disabled , but they should be aware of their value as human beings .
and the most important , the most important , the sum of the constraints and the creativity of human beings is the connections .
so the tough years of hard work on this is not something we shouldn &apos;t be <unk> or <unk> ; it &apos;s not something that we should avoid or hide or hide , and we should seek opportunities in adversity .
in fact , the reason I want to point out is that adversity is not used to overcome it ; we should embrace it and embrace it and I used it as a <unk> term , or even dance with it .
perhaps , if we can look at adversity as something natural and billions of weeks of natural or human beings , it &apos;s no longer a burden for us .
this year , we celebrated the 200 anniversary of Darwin , and when Darwin writes about the evolution of the species 150 years ago , he <unk> the truths of the human feature .
and the phrase that he said probably meant that the species that were surviving were not the strongest , not the smartest , but the outside environment that changed best .
conflict is the mother of creation .
Darwin and all of your great heroes have revealed that this transformation of human well @-@ being is the transformation of the human soul and the horror of humanity .
and I &apos;m going to reiterate that again , the greatest human being is transformation and adaptive .
maybe , before we get too far , we don &apos;t know what it is .
and perhaps that &apos;s the role of adversity , a sense of self and individual ability .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of adversity as an opportunity to change .
it wasn &apos;t a tough time .
adversity is a change , and we &apos;re still not ready to adapt to it .
and I think the biggest dilemma we &apos;ve created for ourselves is the notion of &quot; <unk> . &quot;
okay , what is it about <unk> and <unk> ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with <unk> and <unk> .
I know what it is , what it is , what it is , what it is , what it is , I don &apos;t know what it is , what it is , what if there &apos;s that kind of poor , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , what you &apos;re interested in ?
I don &apos;t think so .
if we don &apos;t invest in the pursuit of the same values , but invest in the possibilities , the potential of many children , the potential of many children , the potential of many children , will be much better , and they will be able to value their communities and contribute to their communities .
anthropologists tell us that as human beings , we always hope that the people in our community are helpful , the ability to contribute .
now , the Neanderthals , around 60,000 years ago , are a great evidence of the Neanderthals , the social sciences , because they believe that old people have a great life , and that is a great value for their entire society .
older people are never seen as useless , they &apos;re considered as valuable .
one day a few years ago , I was in the northwest part of my hometown of <unk> , Pennsylvania was standing next to a <unk> tomato .
because it was summer , I was wearing shorts .
I came up with a man &apos;s voice behind me , but isn &apos;t that Amy <unk> <unk> ?
and I turned around , and what I found was a <unk> <unk> I didn &apos;t know .
and I said , Mr. <unk> excuse me , have we met ? I &apos;ve forgotten you .
and he said , well , you don &apos;t remember the meeting we met .
because at the time , I was <unk> you out of your mother &apos;s uterus .
that &apos;s what I met .
and of course , finally I thought that .
this man was doctor doctor , and I just learned this story by the mother told me that I was a late night , and two weeks later .
and that &apos;s when my mother was on vacation to take care of her doctor &apos;s shop , so she ended up being a doctor and a woman that my parents didn &apos;t know anything about .
and when I was born , there were no <unk> of my feet , my toes , and Father <unk> , he had to convey two bad things .
and he said to me , &quot; I published that diagnosis and he told your parents , and I said , you &apos;re never going to walk , you &apos;re never going to live like any other child , you &apos;re going to never be separate from the rest of your life , but ever since then you &apos;ve been trying to make me a life .
one of the great things Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father Father <unk> , all of the stories about my childhood , including me when I was in my second year two and a woman child soldier in the diaspora in the university , and the fact that my students ended up in the course of the course of the year university , and the year of the year of the year university , I was playing university , and taught in my educational
he called my story the X factor of the human mind , the infinite potential of the human mind .
there &apos;s no medical diagnostic to explain how powerful this will be , how powerful will it affect a human quality of life .
and Father <unk> continued to say to me that even though many times others have resisted it , according to my own experience , even giving them a little bit of support , they have made a difference .
see , the doctor &apos;s mind changed .
and he realized that there was a difference between the medical diagnosis and the way one person treated it .
a few years later , my ideas have a transformation , which is , if you were 15 years old , asked me if I &apos;d rather use my current prosthetic arm , I would agree to give you a pair of prostheses .
because I wanted to get that kind of security .
but if you ask me the same question today , I &apos;m going to ask you .
and that &apos;s because of the experience that I use the prosthetic hand , I have a huge impact on me .
perhaps , I &apos;ve been inside out because , in the people I met , people that opened my door to the new door , they opened my door to the new door more than a man in my heart .
see , what you need is somebody who can show you the power of yourself .
the human soul is inclusive , and if you can give somebody another keys , give him the keys to unlock their strength and at the moment in time , you can unlock the keys to somebody else , and that &apos;s the best way to educate them in the best way .
because you &apos;re teaching them to open the door to the new world .
in fact , the significance of the word &quot; education &quot; is in the words of the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s the glimpse of the potential of something deep inside of it .
so , what kind of potential do we want to remove ?
there was a case in the 1960s where the children from elementary school to secondary school in England .
in Britain &apos;s name is <unk> <unk> , and in the United States , we call it the <unk> test .
the exam students divided them up from Point A , B , C , D .
there &apos;s a better teacher , and so on .
this experiment was a three @-@ month trial where students should be told that they were A @-@ waiting students , they were told they were brilliant for three months at the end of the trial , and this group of students had exactly the same performance as A had been shown .
and of course , there &apos;s a flip side to it , of course , and that is , those who are supposed to be called A &apos;s student , they &apos;re told they &apos;re D and so on .
three months of experiments ended .
many of them have dropped out .
and one of the key points for this experiment was that the teachers who participated were not aware of .
the teachers didn &apos;t know they were getting wet .
the teachers were just told which A was an idiot , and what was going on was the &quot; D teacher &quot; round .
so , I think the real disabilities of real life are a soul that has been beaten , a soul that has no hope for the future , a soul that has no hope for the future , a lack of curiosity , a soul that lost the human imagination .
if , if we were to allow the human spirit to see the soul and the beauty of the other and the joy of the civilization and the imagination , then we even use our power in a great way .
as long as a soul still has those qualities , it creates an infinite possibility and a new way of life .
and I want to leave you with a poem by the end of the poem that was written in the 12th century by a friend of mine , an Jacques Cousteau called &quot; A only know four words , &quot; each child knows that God has four words , not four words , but four words of God , but repeat them as words , but as I say .
dancing with me . thank you .
I want you to just imagine a wearable robot that could give you a superhero ability , or a wheelchair of the users can walk again .
we call this exoskeleton in Berkeley .
there &apos;s nothing else that you &apos;re wearing in the morning , and it &apos;s going to give you an extra amount of strength , and it &apos;s going to give you your speed , like , control .
it &apos;s actually integrating humans and machines .
but not only that -- it &apos;s going to combine and connect you with the outside world , connecting to other devices .
it &apos;s not just something they didn &apos;t want .
to show you what we &apos;re doing right now , we &apos;re going to talk about American soldiers , and they &apos;re about 100 pounds of weight on the back , and they &apos;re also asked to carry more equipment .
obviously , this leads to problems of <unk> -- 30 percent of soldiers with back @-@ to @-@ injury -- chronic back injury .
so we thought we should face this challenge and create an exoskeleton to help solve this problem .
so let me tell you a little bit about <unk> -- the human body loads .
soldiers : after I have <unk> an exoskeleton , I can carry 200 pounds in complex terrain .
it &apos;s flexible design that allows you to go deep and rich and flexibility .
it feels what I want to do , where I want to go , and increase my strength and last strength .
Ben <unk> : we &apos;re going to engage with our industry and are ready to introduce this new exoskeleton in this year .
it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s turn to the wheelchair right now , and that &apos;s part of my personal love .
there are probably 38 million users in the world .
about one percent of the population .
this is a conservative estimate .
what we &apos;re going to say now is that very young people with spinal cord injury -- 20 , 30 years old , 40 years old -- touch a wheelchair as the only choice .
and it &apos;s also making the numbers grow .
and the only choice , roughly -- when someone has a stroke or something else -- is a wheelchair .
it &apos;s actually happened 500 years ago , and it &apos;s a very successful introduction , and I must say .
so I think we should start writing new songs , new stories about them .
now let me introduce you to Amanda , <unk> , who had been damaged by the spines 19 years ago , so she couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years until now .
Amanda <unk> : thank you .
<unk> : I said , that &apos;s exactly what Amanda is wearing .
it has sensors .
they send a signal to the back of her back @-@ to @-@ the @-@ back computer in these support devices .
and there &apos;s a battery pack , and there &apos;s a rear @-@ powered battery in her <unk> , including her <unk> electric battery , which allows her to move on a smooth natural pace .
Amanda : the pinnacle of my life when I was 24 years old , I fell asleep and fell asleep and I was paralyzed .
and in that moment , I lost all the feelings and the ability of the pelvis underneath .
shortly after , a doctor comes into my ward and says to me , &quot; Amanda , you &apos;re no longer walking . &quot;
that was 19 years ago .
he deprive me of the hope that I exist .
I &apos;ve been able to learn how to ski again , climbing , even hand @-@ <unk> .
but nothing invented made me walk , until now .
thank you .
<unk> : as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down , which we &apos;ve talked to you about .
it &apos;s in our hands , we have all the potential , to change our children &apos;s lives -- not just for soldiers , but for Amanda <unk> and all the wheelchair , but for everybody .
Amanda : thank you .
in New York , I &apos;m the director of the nonprofit sector .
in the midst of all the poverty I had , I was sort of a volunteer fire and I kind of started conducting .
in our little town , where volunteers are a place of successful people , you &apos;re going to have to go very early and very early on .
I remember the first fire .
I &apos;m the second volunteer , and I &apos;m probably going to be able to get involved in this .
but you also have to win other volunteers , first of all , to get him to work in .
when I finally found the king , he was <unk> and <unk> about the worst day of her life .
it was <unk> , and she was standing in her pajamas and <unk> and <unk> and her house was <unk> .
another volunteer that was named after I got to start school was named after the volunteers , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and was distributed to kill the puppy dog , to save the baby .
<unk> ! I was so jealous .
it was a lawyer or a full @-@ life lawyer or a full @-@ life dog for the rest of his life to tell people that he was living a living puppy or a living puppy , because he was more alive than I was .
all right , next to me .
force &apos;s called me .
he said , &quot; <unk> . I need you to be cool .
I need you upstairs , and I want you to pick up the door for this woman . &quot;
it &apos;s true . I swear .
this is not the image that I &apos;ve painted in my mind , but I went upstairs , and I walked up to the bottom of the corridor , and they went through the real &quot; fireman , and they kind of put the fire out , and they took a pair of shoes .
I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m not a hero .
and I took my mission down to the front door , and I met that guy that was there earlier , sir and the dog that he had .
we took our <unk> to the front door , and there was no accident , and he was more concerned than I had .
a few weeks later , we received a letter from the <unk> that saved our little family planning .
and she was specifically talking about this little , fuzzy details , and somebody took a pair of shoes for her .
whether I &apos;m working in &quot; <unk> , &quot; or me as a volunteer <unk> , I &apos;ve seen a lot of very generous <unk> , and I &apos;ve also seen how different a person &apos;s courage and compassion can be .
you know what I learned ?
they &apos;re all equally important .
and when I look around , people who succeed or are about to succeed , you all have these amazing things that I want to remind you : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for you to get the first million to change the life of somebody else .
if you &apos;ve got something to give you , it &apos;s time to start .
it doesn &apos;t feed people .
a model .
not every day , we have the opportunity to save lives , but every day we have the opportunity to impact the lives of others .
come on : get those shoes saved .
thank you .
Miguel Nicolelis : mark , Mark , back .
thank you .
I just came back from a community that had the secret of the human being .
in this community , women are empowered to have sex with you , and play is the next day -- and it &apos;s a serious play .
no , it &apos;s not just men who burn up , not San Francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your close relatives .
this is the world of bonobos &apos;s bonobos in Congo .
the bonobos are the closest relatives of the chimpanzees that we all live in .
that means that we all share a common ancestor , a grandmother that had evolved to live about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are dying for their females .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve been so <unk> about the evolutionary history of human evolution .
but the bonobos show us the flip side of the coin .
when the chimps are dominated by the size of the females , the bonobos are led by the females .
the bonobos are so good for the bonobos to live in such a highly inclusive society , where lethal violence has not yet been observed .
but unfortunately , the bonobos are one of the most famous chimps known as <unk> .
they live deep beneath the jungles of the Congo , so the research is very difficult .
Congo is a wonderful <unk> -- she &apos;s a remarkable biodiversity and beautiful land of the Congo , but she &apos;s also a dark and violent scene that has been taking decades of life , as World War I.
and it wasn &apos;t surprising that it was also a life of the bonobos .
the business of meat and the bushes that are disappearing means that we can &apos;t provide a small habitat for the only chimpanzee in the world -- we can &apos;t even know if there &apos;s a smaller habitat .
and yet , on this wild and chaotic land you can hear a lot of <unk> dancing in the trees .
what are these close relatives ?
we know that they &apos;re &quot; have sex , don &apos;t have war , &quot; so they have frequent , casual sex and <unk> to handle conflict and social problems .
now I &apos;m not suggesting that this is a way to solve all of the problems that humans have -- because play is more than <unk> for the bonobos .
the bonobos are like humans , and they love play throughout their lifetime .
play is not just a child &apos;s game .
for all of us and for the bonobos , play is based on the basis of intimacy and parenting .
it also allows us to learn the rules of trust and games .
it &apos;s a combination of creativity and resilience , it &apos;s all about the emergence of diversity -- the interplay , the diversity of behavior , the connection of diversity .
when you look at the <unk> of the bonobos , you see that there &apos;s a lot of evolutionary root of the cause of human evolution , dancing and rituals .
play is what makes us interconnected .
now I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you two clips of just taken from the wild to special projects .
first of all , this is a <unk> game of bonobos -- I don &apos;t mean soccer .
here , two young females playing the game .
look what she &apos;s doing .
this may be the phrase &quot; She &apos;s playing with the origins of his music . &quot;
I just think he likes that way , right .
yes .
so the bonobos are so good for both of them .
and this video is really interesting because it proves -- this video is really interesting because it shows the creativity that brings things that are unusual elements into the game -- like the testicles of the tasks -- how games can seek trust and nurture -- and at the same time it turns out to be infinite .
but play is a transformation process .
play is a <unk> process , and it can become a lot of play , some games are silent , imagination , imagination , <unk> -- and perhaps magic of this play is new .
and I want to show you , this is <unk> , a young woman who is playing water in the trash .
and I think , like her , we play with each other , and we explore the boundaries of our hearts and our external world .
it &apos;s the <unk> of play that motivates us to explore , drive us to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we &apos;ve created are really the breeding ground for creativity .
so these are just the bits that give us this profound insight into the past and the present .
but they also have a secret to our future , and in the future we need to embrace an increasingly challenging world that has never been creative and much more partnerships .
the secret is play &apos;s key to all of these abilities .
in other words , play is the will of our future <unk> .
in order to succeed , we need play .
but are we going to play as little as we can ?
play is not a small thing .
play is essential .
for the bonobos , as humans , life is not just simply the same teeth and teeth .
it &apos;s the most appropriate thing to play , but it might be the most demanding play .
well , my own primates , let us embrace the gift of a gift that we play with each other , and that brings us back to the realization of creativity , the relationship and wonder .
thank you .
and I want you to imagine that the same day in 1979 , the same moment , is the same moment every time a child -- good life .
and then there was a whole bunch of parents , and there was a child .
now , I don &apos;t want you all to spend a lot of time imagining the pregnancy because if you spend too much time thinking about it , you &apos;re not going to hear it .
so think about that a little bit .
so in this case , let me just think about , well , the sperm that carried the Y chromosome with the X chromosome .
the other is the sperm that carried the X chromosome with the X chromosome .
two of them survive , and both start to grow .
let &apos;s take a look at that .
I became two characters in the field that I was doing .
one of the roles was my anatomy .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and what I study is how humans deal with anatomy -- human bodies , human bodies , or animal bodies -- how they deal with body fluids , abstract bodies , how they think about bodies .
another role is that as an activist as a role for the patient -- or , as I sometimes say , as a physician &apos;s patient -- I &apos;m pretty radical .
and that &apos;s what happened to me in my work , is that there are challenges of people who challenge the doors .
for example , some of the people I &apos;ve been touched by are the <unk> , two of whom share a body .
and some of them are more than just the average person .
and also , many of the people I meet are different from their gender -- they don &apos;t have a standard male feature or a female signature .
in general , this symptoms can be called <unk> .
there are many different forms .
let me give you just a few examples of the types of men that you can either have a non @-@ standard male feature or not a standard female .
one example of one can have four chromosomes , and , of course , genetic stimulation on the Y chromosome , has the raw ingredients that we have in the baby and turn it into the testicles .
so during the baby period , the testicles produce hormone .
but this individual lack the receptor to receive hormone oxytocin , and not respond to the testicles .
this is a disorder called commonly called <unk> syndrome .
so it &apos;s a lot of hormone hormone , but it can &apos;t cause it .
so the body moves towards the female trend .
when the baby was born , she looked like a girl .
she was a girl and she was raised as a young girl .
most of the time , until puberty started in her chest , she didn &apos;t have women &apos;s cycles , and we start to wonder what happens .
and so they looked at her , and they found that she didn &apos;t have her <unk> and her uterus , and she carried the Y chromosome in her body .
now , one of the big questions that I want to point out is that you must think that this guy is actually not a boy .
women , like men , have an organ called <unk> .
it &apos;s behind our body .
and fire is responsible for a male hormone .
like most of my women -- I believe I am a typical woman -- I don &apos;t really know what my chromosome is , but I think I should be a typical woman -- most women like me are actually a woman like me are actually a sensitive female .
we pump testosterone , and we respond to it .
as a result , there were women like me , and the brain exposed more testosterone than the girl that was born with a female , and that girl had more <unk> testosterone than she was born .
so gender is a very complex thing ; it &apos;s not about the people who are in the room of men and women -- in some ways , they can cover the whole range of sexual function .
another couple of years ago , I received a phone call from a six @-@ year @-@ old boy named a boy who was brought in as a boy who later had a girlfriend and a girlfriend who had had a life of having sex with his girlfriend , but recently , he found himself in her body as her <unk> and <unk> .
all of his is an extreme disorder called the <unk> @-@ 21 @-@ billion @-@ dollar syndrome .
he carried seven chromosomes , and at the time of the uterus , his <unk> became a male &apos;s environment .
and as a result , he grew up the male <unk> , and his brain received more typical male hormone .
so he was born and looked like a boy -- no one was suspicious .
only when he was 19 years old , when he started having a biological problem , there was actually a period of period in the body , and the doctors realized that , in fact , the inside of him was female .
all right , let &apos;s quickly look at another example of what could possibly have a sexual existence .
some of you have <unk> chromosomes that develop an organ called <unk> , which is a kind of organ that is covered in skull .
we don &apos;t know what it is .
so gender can be pretty hot .
the children with these physical traits -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> -- are often not surgical for the surgeon , the reason why it &apos;s not , actually , for their health .
because in many cases , their bodies are healthy .
they have all kinds of reasons for surgery because they were threatened by the dangers of our society .
or there &apos;s a typical structure of what the body is , what the features are .
so the idea is that as a woman , you have to have the property of a woman , and so on and so forth , a black person has to have the body of your African <unk> .
so we had this sort of simple recognition .
and when we &apos;re faced with something different about the body , the ideas that we don &apos;t categorize , they surprise us .
so a lot of our cultures have a lot of days really the idea of being <unk> .
and our country is based on a very unusual concept of <unk> .
okay , so you can imagine how amazing it was when two children were born in a body .
and I recently met this situation recently when last year Africa , the Africa track athletes , <unk> <unk> , were questioned by the international competition in Berlin .
a lot of reporters called me and ask me , &quot; What kind of test will they prove to you by <unk> <unk> or female ? &quot;
so I had to explain to them that there was no way to test .
in fact , we now know that gender is complicated , and we have to admit that there &apos;s no clear line of dividing men or women or men or women or women or <unk> , and that line is actually our own painted .
so what we &apos;re seeing now is that the more the science is developing , the more we give it to the form of gender , the more we take for granted , the structure of the body is simply too simple to give the features , the reality is much more blurry than we can imagine .
and it &apos;s not just about gender issues .
and it &apos;s also about the issues of race , and the complexity of our academic experimentation is not something that our science has been described .
as we &apos;ve seen , we have all kinds of hard fields .
let &apos;s take an example , and the reality is that we compare it with 95 percent of human DNA with gorilla .
the fact that the fact is that human DNA and gorilla is only made a difference in some bones .
the more technologies are going to evolve , the more difficult we have to admit , are simply too simplistic .
and that &apos;s because of that , we &apos;re looking at life in all aspects of human life .
one of the fields , for example , is our cultural sphere , the culture of the United States of America today and the end of life .
we have a tough discussion about when we turn from one body to a human , and we have a different human right to the baby .
we have a very controversial subject today -- perhaps beyond the <unk> of medicine -- about the question of when to identify people dying .
in the old days , our ancestors never sat there far too much .
and most of all , it &apos;s the ability to stick an feathers in your nose , and if the feathers moved , people wouldn &apos;t break them .
if feathers don &apos;t move , they disappear .
but what &apos;s happening now is that we want to transplant the organ of the deceased into other people &apos;s bodies .
and as a result , we started asking the questions on the puzzle we talked about , about what was dying , and that caused us to enter a difficult situation , which didn &apos;t have any form before .
now you might think that all of these categories that are broken may be great for people like me .
I was a progressive man in politics , and I was the one who kept the <unk> of the body , but I had to admit , it really disturbed me .
realizing these institutions are more unstable than we thought of , making me nervous .
and at the same time , my tensions came from democratic ideas .
so to tell you the extent of this tension , I want to admit that I &apos;m the biggest fan of all .
I know they &apos;re a <unk> , they &apos;re the male <unk> , but they &apos;re great .
I mean , they &apos;re so heroic , fearless and engaged in their own business , and I &apos;ll re @-@ enjoy the new musical composition every few years , the creation of that original acronym &quot; <unk> , &quot; not because music is so good , music is completely visible .
it was because of what was happening around the world .
the founding leaders , I think they were the earliest <unk> , and that &apos;s why I love them .
they were against the concept of a anatomy , and then they had another nice concept of what it meant for 200 years .
and when you think about our foundation , what they &apos;re arguing about is the idea of a constitutional monarchy and that was based on the idea of simplicity .
the monarchs under the old institutions didn &apos;t have DNA , but they were following the idea of &quot; birth . &quot;
they have concepts of aristocracy .
they think that the people in politics , the people in politics , should be because of the aristocracy , went from the father to the son .
the founding leaders against that view , and they use a new conception of anatomy , and that &apos;s the idea of <unk> .
they got rid of the hierarchy of ideas , and they figured out the importance of their anatomy , and the importance of the human form , not the birth of the birth of it , and that was a radical innovation .
and in a way , it &apos;s still happening now because they &apos;re part of the Enlightenment system , and two things are common .
democratic institutions were being formed at the time , but technology was also being developed .
and it &apos;s pretty obvious that if you look at the history of the foundations , many of them are interested in science and they &apos;re all interested in the world .
they dismiss the supernatural ideas they dismiss the supernatural powers of supernatural powers because of the ideas of supernatural power spread based on very blurry ideas .
they were calling the concept of <unk> .
and if you look at it , for example , in the Declaration of Independence , they talked about nature and nature .
they didn &apos;t mention the nature of God and God .
they mentioned the power of nature to explain who we are .
so as part of that , they bring an idea for us , and that is that human life has a equality .
and they really prepared a great road for the future of the Civil Rights Movement .
they couldn &apos;t imagine what was going to happen , but they built our foundations , and that was great .
so what happened a few years later ?
what happened to women , for example , what their power to vote is based on the ideas that were founded by the inspirational people , and they said , &quot; We have the uterus and the ovaries , which is not necessarily the fact that we don &apos;t have the right to vote for citizen rights and so on . &quot;
the women &apos;s cause a lot of good .
and the next thing was the successful civil rights movement that came out of this quote by <unk> <unk> , &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot;
we knew that men had great <unk> on the development of the Civil Rights Movement , &quot; I was a man . &quot;
in addition , the appeal to the <unk> , rather than racism .
we see the same successes happening in people &apos;s rights .
the problem is , of course , when we started looking at all the citizens , we had to start questioning why we were trying to preserve a static line .
now , what I want to leave you with now is that I want to stay with some boundaries of the body structure , within our culture .
for example , I don &apos;t want to give fish the same power as humans .
I don &apos;t want us to give up the distinction between the anatomy .
I don &apos;t want , because kids with sexual activity can be allowed to be married .
so there are lines of anatomy , and there are meaning to us , and I think that should be kept .
but the great challenge is to try and figure out what &apos;s important , why we want to preserve them , what they mean .
so , let &apos;s go back to what we &apos;ve been talking about , which is the first two people that came out of the session .
we had six and a half million babies pregnant in 1979 .
let &apos;s imagine , Mary was born three months earlier , and she was born on June 1 , 1980 .
Henry , on the contrary , the foot was born in October of 1980 .
just because Mary was born three months earlier , the fact that she had a lot of rights over three months earlier than the power of an election to have an election , a right to drink .
he had to wait for his physiology to be different , but because he was born different .
we also found other incredible rights problems .
well , Henry , since Nobel Prize was tested for men -- although I hadn &apos;t told you that he was a <unk> chromosome -- because it was hypothesized to be a man , so now Mary didn &apos;t have to worry about this .
and at the same time , Mary couldn &apos;t enjoy all states like Henry , the same rights , the right to get married .
Henry could be married in any state , but Mary is now married in a few states .
so some of the organisms that we insisted on , they have problems in many ways and need to question .
and for me , the question becomes : what are we going to do when our science is so advanced in anatomy , we &apos;ve been to admit that democracy on the anatomy may be broken .
I don &apos;t want to lose hope for science , but at the same time , <unk> , the invention of science is influenced by our impact .
so where are we going to go ?
it looks like our society has a utilitarian attitude : &quot; well , I have to draw a boundary somewhere , and I &apos;m just drawn a line somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get a very embarrassing place .
for example , Texas has a decision to marry a man which means you don &apos;t have Y chromosomes , and if you marry a woman , it means you have Y chromosomes .
in reality , they don &apos;t actually test the chromosomes .
but this was also surprising , because I told you the story about the stigma .
for example , one of the founders of modern democracy , Martin Luther King , in his &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech , gave us a solution .
he thought we should not judge a man &apos;s skin , but because of his <unk> , he said that we should not judge a human being .
and I said , &quot; Yeah , that sounds like a good solution . &quot;
but how did you do it in practice ?
how do you judge him based on his ethics ?
and I also want to point out that I &apos;m not sure how we should distribute human rights , because I have to acknowledge that some of the gold is more likely than some of the people I know that some of them are more likely to help society .
and I also want to say that I know that some <unk> seem to be even more <unk> than some 40 @-@ year @-@ olds in the issue of marriage , more clever , more mature decision .
so how do we measure the ethical problem ?
it turns out it &apos;s very difficult .
and I also wanted to know that if the right thing could be scanned in the future -- maybe you could see it in an MRI machine ?
do we really want to get there ?
I &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what I know is that it &apos;s important to think about the problem of democracy that the United States leading to .
we &apos;ve done a very good job of trying to ask for democracy , and I think we &apos;re going to do better .
we were different from Iran , like a man who was amazingly attractive to other men , and he was killed unless he was willing to change his sexuality , he would survive .
we didn &apos;t have that .
and I &apos;m very happy to say that we didn &apos;t have that -- to a surgeon who said , &quot; That was after a few years ago , and he had a wonderful hope to help them separate , and to sort of make them famous .
but when I asked him why he wanted to do this surgery -- because it was a dangerous surgery -- he replied that the children in this country would be cruel to do it , so he had to help them do it .
and my answer to him was , &quot; Well , have you thought about <unk> instead of having surgery ? &quot;
the United States provides a lot of their own characteristics for kids like this , and they may not have to change their body in a country .
so I think we should be leading this idea .
okay , so here I want to remind you that I &apos;ve talked a lot about what I &apos;ve been talking about .
I also want to think about what democracy might look like , or what it might be like if we could get more mothers to participate .
and I also want to say that a little bit of radical about the feminist idea that I think different people might be able to bring different perspectives , especially when we get used to thinking about old books .
I &apos;ve been interested in <unk> for many years and years as well .
and one of the things that I &apos;m really interested in is looking at the difference between men and women around the world and the solutions that are being solved .
we learned from a cross @-@ cultural study that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- are more likely to look at complex social relations and more caring about the disadvantaged of the human population .
so if we think that &apos;s the way we discovered something interesting .
a few years ago , when I read my graduate student a few years ago , one of my <unk> knew that I was very interested in -- my feminist was always -- he asked me a weird question .
and he said , &quot; Well , tell me where feminism is . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s the best question I &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is the basis of all the activities of the old @-@ fashioned gender , and as a result , feminism is not a shame .
but , to further interpret this question , I think more about it , perhaps the feminist has a little bit of a pregnancy .
that is to say , maybe there are a few more women &apos;s minds that are different from the parts of men , and we are richer and more concerned about the social relations that are more vulnerable to those who are vulnerable .
but the previous thing that people had pointed out was how to protect an individual country &apos;s impact , and if we put it in this concept of <unk> , as more likely , we &apos;re going to have more ideas than just how to protect each other , but how to take care of each other .
maybe that &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to go in the future , and when we don &apos;t take away democracy from the individual -- it &apos;s less about the individual , it &apos;s about the individual identity of the individual , but more about the human relationship .
so when people are trying to create a better industrial complex , what we need to think about is what we do for other people .
thank you .
I &apos;m Jesse , and this is my <unk> .
but when I showed you what I had put in there , I had to do a very open @-@ ended sketch , which was , I was obsessed with clothing .
I was looking for them and wearing them , and recently , I &apos;ve also fallen pictures of their pictures and their blog about them , and each of them has a different set of colorful , crazy clothing , the most appropriate place for that .
but I didn &apos;t buy anything new .
my clothes were bought from dental <unk> and <unk> .
Oh , thank you .
<unk> made me reduce the impact of clothing , and the impact of my wallet .
I could meet all kinds of funny people ; I could save money to charity ; I was dressed as a <unk> ; while at the same time , shopping was my private currency .
and I thought , what will I find today ?
would that be my size ?
is it my favorite color ?
will it be under 20 dollars ?
if the answer is yes , I feel like I win .
and I want to go back to my <unk> and tell you what I &apos;ve taken for a week at TED .
what &apos;s this guy with so many clothes ?
so I &apos;m going to show you what I took .
and I took all of that .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened to me on the week .
I would bet I &apos;d found all the clothes that I needed in <unk> .
since you see me right now , not the woman sitting next to TED -- that meant I actually found something new .
and now I really want to show you my week of laundry .
isn &apos;t that nice ?
and of course , I &apos;m also going to talk to you about life <unk> and so forth , whether you believe it or not , these are all the ideas that I &apos;ve been <unk> in &quot; Best <unk> , &quot; you know .
so we started Sunday .
my name is &quot; Tiger . &quot;
you don &apos;t need to be <unk> with a lot of money .
even if you &apos;re almost 50 dollars , it &apos;s pretty impressive .
this whole suit , this entire coat of clothing , was the most expensive dress I could wear in my pocket .
Monday : color is powerful .
in biology , it &apos;s almost impossible to wear bright red pants on a bright red pair of pants that &apos;s still smiling .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other people to be happy .
Tuesday : the mainstream is way <unk> .
I spent a lot of my life trying to do myself and to come in mainstream .
you do it yourself .
if you have the right people around you , they will not only understand , they will enjoy it .
Wednesday : embracing your <unk> .
and sometimes people tell me that I &apos;m dressed , or I reminded them of their seven @-@ year @-@ olds .
I liked to smile to them and said , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
reliability is key .
if you think you wear something that looks pretty good , then you &apos;d dress pretty well .
if you don &apos;t think you &apos;re looking good , you &apos;re pretty sure .
growing up , my mom told me this every day .
but I was between 30 and 30 years old enough to know what that means .
and I &apos;ll give you a quick analysis .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person , no clothes , no clothes you can &apos;t wear .
so everyone in this room has no reason .
we could want to wear anything .
thank you .
Friday : a pervasive truth -- a few words for you : the King <unk> .
and finally , Saturday : developing unique <unk> . it &apos;s really a great way to tell the world who you are and who doesn &apos;t have to say .
and it was again and again showing me that this week as people walked over and over again , it was just because of what I was wearing . we had a great conversation .
of course , the clothes didn &apos;t break into my little iron .
so before I got back to Brooklyn , I was going to pull everything out .
because this week I was teaching myself to let go .
I don &apos;t need to be worn out , because in the next corner , there will always be a crazy set of clothes that paint me just waiting for me , as long as I &apos;m looking for love .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon .
I have something I want to show you .
think of this as a pixel , a fly pixels .
we &apos;re in the lab , we call it <unk> design .
let me introduce you to this .
now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian , every Italian boy in Italy has this picture of them growing up , but I &apos;ll show you that because something interesting happened in the <unk> equation over the last few decades .
in the old days , if you wanted to have a budget at <unk> , you just had to have a budget , and you gamble on a good bet and a good car .
if you &apos;re good enough about your car and your car , then you &apos;re going to run away .
now , if you want to add up to this day , actually you also need something else , like this -- something that can actually test the contents of the automobile that &apos;s been packed with thousands of sensors that are collected in the car , sending it into the system , and processing that feedback as a result , it actually changes the information in the car itself .
and that &apos;s what engineers call a real @-@ time monitor system .
basically , the system consists of two parts : one is a drives .
now , what &apos;s interesting here is that this real @-@ time surveillance system is beginning to absorb our lives .
our cities , over the last few years , have been covered by networks , electronic industrial industries .
it becomes like wireless and close @-@ up computers .
and at the same time , as a wireless and closed computer , they started responding to different feedback and <unk> .
if we can optimize the city , it &apos;s actually a leap .
I would like to say that the city is only two percent of the Earth &apos;s surface , but they occupy 50 percent of the world population .
their energy consumption is 75 percent of the world &apos;s CO2 emissions .
so if we optimize the city , that &apos;s going to be a flying .
on these cities , all of these senses and rhythms are entering into our daily lives .
this was an exhibition at an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
the theme was &quot; talking to me . &quot;
our things , our environment , are beginning to give us feedback .
in a sense , like every atom is becoming sensor and sensor .
and it fundamentally changed our relationship as human and nature .
and in a way , this is the old dream of the old dream .
you know , when Moses was like Moses , like Moses , at the end he got a <unk> , threw it to Moses -- as you see at the bottom of the little <unk> -- saying , &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re talking to the <unk> , why ? &quot;
today , for the first time , our environment started giving us feedback .
I &apos;m going to show you just a few cases -- once , as our consciousness comes to our environment .
let &apos;s start with sensing .
the first project I want to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab .
that was Italy six months ago in April .
what we &apos;re doing there is actually a new network that was already being covered in the world -- cell phones networks -- and collected information from this network at any terminal pace to understand how cities work .
the summer of the summer was a lucky summer of 2006 .
this was the year the Italian World Cup <unk> .
some of you may remember , that was the German competition for France , which was a little bit before , and that wasn &apos;t enough .
anyway , Italy eventually won .
now watch what happened that day with the grid to actually demonstrate what happened in real time .
you see the city now .
you see the big Rome <unk> , the <unk> theater .
this was the morning , before the match .
you &apos;re looking at the top clock .
and at noon , the people over there called and walking .
the game started -- silence .
<unk> . Italy was a great deal .
everybody quickly ordered a call , went to a toilet .
the game ended .
the first one , the second one .
and it was the time when the lights were .
Italian won . ha . ha .
that night , everybody went to the inner city celebration .
you can see rush hour .
the next day , everybody went to the city center and greeted the <unk> and the prime minister .
and then he turned back .
you see this place called the <unk> <unk> , which started in Rome , and people celebrated -- there &apos;s a great party at the end of the day , and you see rush hour .
this is just one of the examples of how we now perceive this city in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
another quick example of perception : this time it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consumed .
today , we know where everything comes from .
this is a map showing you all the <unk> of a Mac , how to assemble .
but we had very few things to know where the last lost was .
so this project , we actually invented some small tags to track the waste from the system as it moves .
we actually spent a year with a couple of volunteers in Seattle who were willing to help our volunteers in Seattle , just a year ago giving us the stuff that people were throwing away -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that we just threw away anyway .
we put little <unk> , little tags on the garbage , and we started tracking it .
this is what we observe .
from Seattle ...
a week later .
and from that information , we realized that there &apos;s so much productivity in the system .
I actually do the same thing with less energy .
this data was not available .
but there &apos;s a lot of garbage and complex things happening .
there &apos;s another thing that we believe that if we want the cups that we thrown away every day , it doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on Earth .
we still drop the plastic bottle every day .
if we showed this to people , then we could also promote changes in behavior .
so that &apos;s what this project meant .
I &apos;m at MIT &apos;s colleagues , the Peace Prize , and he &apos;s going to tell you a lot more about perception and a lot of amazing things we can do , but I want to start with the second part , which is actually about our environment .
the first project was done a couple of years ago in Spain .
it started with a question that was asked by the mayor of the mayor , and he came to us and said that Spain used in the South of Europe , in the tradition of doing water in public water .
the question is : technology , new technology , how do you make it cool ?
and one of the ideas came from an R &amp; amp ; D group from MIT is about , imagine a pipe , and you have the valves , the valves , the low kidney chemistry , and off .
you create a <unk> of water as pixels .
and if the pixels leave , you can create it on it , you can show the images , the text .
and when you get close to it , it even turns off to give you a jump , as you see here .
we showed this to the mayor of <unk> .
he loved it .
and then we got permission from the expo to build a building .
we call it number <unk> .
the entire building is made of water .
there are no doors or windows , but when you walk into it , it automatically opens up the road .
the roof is also covered with water .
if there &apos;s a little bit of wind , if you want a little bit of water , you can actually cut the roof down .
or even close the building , the building disappears , and it looks like this .
and these days , you &apos;ll see it in the winter days , and when they lowered the roofs of the roof , the people will say , &quot; They &apos;re <unk> the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t , they didn &apos;t , just when it got down , the building was almost completely gone .
this is what water architecture does .
you can see how people get intrigued .
this is the sensor that I &apos;m trying to keep myself warm , testing the sensor .
I should tell you something happened in the night when all the sensors stopped working .
but it made that night more interesting .
all the kids on the site were getting all the different , because the way they got into the building was different .
buildings don &apos;t automatically open you up , but the buildings get absorbed into different spaces , so you couldn &apos;t get wet in this time to get yourself wet .
and it &apos;s also interesting for us , because , as an architect , an engineer , as a designer , we often think about how people use what we &apos;ve designed .
but it &apos;s always unexpected .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing all of these things that are using and interacting with each other .
this is a physical pixel , made out of water , and then made a projection on it .
and it reminds me of the next project I want to show you .
this is , imagine these pixels fly .
imagine you would have a small helicopter that can move in the air , and each of them has a little pixels that can change color -- almost like a cloud that can move in the sky .
watch a video .
imagine a helicopter , as we just saw , and a few other helicopters , synchronize , moving .
so you get this cloud .
you get a flat screen , or you show the panels , like this one -- a two @-@ dimensional setting .
or ordinary , but three @-@ dimensional , the drama here is the pixels , not the pixels .
you can use different methods .
imagine your monitor with different sizes and scales and different <unk> .
but everything is just a three @-@ dimensional pixel cloud that you can zoom in and cross it and see in many , many ways .
this is a decrease as a standard grid .
when you turn on the lights , you can actually see this as it was before .
imagine if every one of them were controlled by the individual .
you can put every pixel in there as a result of that , moving from person to side , and so on .
I &apos;ll show you some of the first ones that I showed you .
we &apos;re working with <unk> <unk> , one of the top <unk> of New York , the New York Museum and studio in Milan to capture the stars in real time by capturing his 3D movements in real time .
you can see <unk> dancing .
you can be on the left , different <unk> .
this is all in real time 3D scanning and dynamics .
so you can reproduce the whole thing .
you can jump in like this .
but once you have those pixels , you can steer them with color and gravity and rotate .
we wanted to use this as a sort of plug @-@ in @-@ of @-@ fire input .
I want to show you the last project we &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s something we did for the London Olympics .
it &apos;s called the digital cloud .
and the idea came from , again , as you can imagine , we can get people involved in trying to change the environment -- which is to sponsor our digital cloud built -- just like the <unk> built , but the digital cloud .
think about giving everyone a pixel .
and I think what &apos;s happened over the last few years is remarkable , in the last few decades , we &apos;ve gone through the physical world to digital world .
now electronics , knowledge , the <unk> of the Internet are everywhere .
today , for the first time , President Obama told us -- we can go from digital self @-@ organized networks to the physical world .
and it &apos;s possible , in this case , to design and create a logo .
it meant building some buildings in the city .
but in the future , it could be the solution to the challenges that are today -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we get from the digital world to the physical world .
so we can actually get people involved in this .
the numbers are clouds of clouds , and , in fact , the pixels form , the way clouds form in reality , the way clouds form clouds .
these particles are water , and the clouds of the pixel are made up of the cloud .
this is London .
you can walk in and experience different experiences .
you can actually see at the bottom , the critical moment of the Olympics in 2012 and really use it as a bridge to connect socially .
and the clouds in the sky and at the top of the moon you can get , like the new top of London .
you can come in .
it was a completely new digital <unk> at night -- but most importantly , it created an experience that any one of you could get there .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is important to me .
through my artwork , I try to illustrate that human beings are not separate from nature , everything is interconnected .
about 10 years ago I went to Antarctica , and I first saw the iceberg .
I felt awe .
my heart is quick and quick , and try to understand what this is in front of me .
the iceberg was almost 200 feet away from me , and I was just surprised that a snowflake was covered in another patch of snow , year after year after year .
the iceberg formed when they broke off the ice sheets , or broke off the Ross Ice Shelf .
each iceberg has its own unique personalities .
they have a vivid way of interacting with the environment around them .
some of the iceberg refused to give it up , and some of the iceberg science just couldn &apos;t stand after a shock .
and when you look at the iceberg , it &apos;s easy to think that they &apos;re all alone , they &apos;re separate , each individual , and more like the way we humans sometimes think about ourselves .
but the reality is much more than that .
as the iceberg melts , I breathe in its ancient smell .
and as the iceberg melts , it free up the minerals and it feeds everything .
and I started photographing these iceberg as I was photographing the portraits of my ancestors , and realized that there was no more way of being there than that .
when they melt , it &apos;s not about death ; it &apos;s not an end , it &apos;s a legacy path to a never @-@ ending .
I photographed the iceberg , some of which were very young -- thousands of years old .
some ice is over 100,000 years .
the last picture I want to show you is a iceberg shot at Greenland &apos;s <unk> .
it &apos;s a very rare opportunity that you can actually see a iceberg unfold .
so here you are .
on the left you see a boat .
it &apos;s about 15 feet of a ship .
I want you to notice the shape of the iceberg , the shape of it on the surface .
and here you see it starting with a boat , a boat moving over to the other side , a man stands there .
this is an average of Greenland .
it came to the water , it was about 120 feet or 40 meters tall .
this video is shot in real time .
like this iceberg , they show you a different aspect of their personality .
thank you .
I &apos;ve had the privilege of getting involved in amazing projects in my life .
but the coolest projects I &apos;ve done are related to this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the original graffiti artists of the 1980s .
and one day he ran back to his house and said , &quot; Daddy , my legs were kind of <unk> . &quot;
this was the early symptoms of the Columbia .
the bones are now completely paralyzed .
only his eyes can act .
and I was in touch with him .
the company that I made design and animation , obviously , is a complex part of the world that we admire and respected in the art world .
so we decided to become Tony , the sponsor of the cause .
so I went to find his brother and his father and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you some money .
what would you do ? &quot;
his brother said , &quot; I just want to be able to talk to Tony again .
I just wanted to communicate with him and he can communicate with me . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Wait a second , I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking , &quot; isn &apos;t all the paralyzed people communicate through these devices and other people ?
and he said , &quot; No , no , unless it &apos;s a silent man , &quot; has a phenomenal mirror , or not at all .
these devices are not as easy to get . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK , how do you communicate ? &quot;
have you ever seen the movie &quot; the <unk> and the butterfly ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- moves their fingers .
and I said , &quot; It &apos;s too messy . how is that possible ? &quot;
the wish that I came along was the opening check , and instead , I had a check that I had no idea how to break up .
I was talking to his brother and his father at the time -- &quot; OK , so let &apos;s talk to his brother , we &apos;re going to give him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way to make him do it again .
because one person still doesn &apos;t communicate properly is ridiculous . &quot;
a few months later , I had a speech at a meeting .
and I met these guys called <unk> , the graffiti research lab , and they had a technology that enabled them to take a ray of light on any surface , and then paint it with a laser pointer , which would form a dark gap .
and they walk around like this to show art .
all of these things , they call it a life @-@ cycle .
the first starts with the <unk> , and then the <unk> , then the <unk> Bush , and people see art .
but they always present a life @-@ cycle .
and I went back to my house , and I had dinner with my wife for dinner with her , and she told her , &quot; Wait a second , if we knew that this technology was going to allow you to use your eye to control things , why don &apos;t we just take a laser , this is what he could do again . &quot;
so we started doing it .
about two years later , about two years later , a year after many organizations and many of us changed something .
first of all , we <unk> the door of the insurance company , and we really gave him a machine that allowed him to communicate -- a Stephen <unk> machine .
that &apos;s great .
he was the most fun person -- I called him <unk> because you were talking to him , and he made you feel like , &quot; I &apos;m not . this guy &apos;s brilliant . &quot;
the other thing we did was , we gathered together programmers from all over the world -- literally , every corner of the world -- bringing them to us .
my wife and my kids and I moved to the garage behind , the hackers , the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> taken over our house .
many of our friends thought that we were so stupid that when we put our house back on the wall , the images were taken , and the walls were painted .
but two weeks later , two weeks later , we went to Venice Street , and my child was involved , and my dog was involved , and we made this .
we call it the <unk> of the eye , and you can see that .
this was the cheap sunglasses , and we bought it on a <unk> in Venice , some of the <unk> and some of the things we bought from <unk> and from Copenhagen .
we take an LED @-@ ray camera , dismantle it , put it in an LED , and now this device is free -- and we &apos;re able to create the source source , you can download it for free .
now we can make this completely impossible .
none of the insurance companies can say , &quot; No . &quot;
no hospital can say , &quot; No . &quot;
anyone who &apos;s paralyzed can now use their eyes to paint and communicate with .
thank you .
thank you very much . that &apos;s great .
and at the end of two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
I love this picture because this is somebody else &apos;s room .
all of these congestion are all for this momentous occasion .
over a year , over two weeks of programming , fast food and night conferences all night long after Tony started drawing in seven years .
this is an amazing image because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking at his life support system .
we had his bed so he could see .
we formed a projector , and we made a wall out of his hospital .
he started painting again , in front of his family and friends -- you can imagine what it felt like in parking lot .
interestingly , we also wanted to break into the parking lot , and we felt like we were part of the whole painting .
and at the end of this , he sent us a notebook that said , &quot; That &apos;s the first time I could ever paint .
I felt that I &apos;d been underwater and finally had a hand to put my hand in the water , and I could breathe . &quot;
that &apos;s great , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s kind of like our fight .
and that &apos;s what kept us moving forward .
we walked that far away to do that .
it &apos;s a wonderful device , but it &apos;s different from the drawings .
a artistic potential has more potential .
we &apos;re also exploring how to make it better , faster , more powerful .
since then , we &apos;ve gotten all kinds of recognition .
we won a lot of rewards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us make money out of it .
all the costs are us .
and we rewards , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s phenomenal . &quot;
Armstrong had written about our Twitter , and then in December , the Time magazine gave us one of the top 50 invention of the year 2010 , which is really cool .
the coolest thing is -- this is going to complete a loop -- April this year in L.A. , the Museum of Modern Art in downtown Los Angeles , there &apos;s going to be a place called &quot; street art . &quot;
and &quot; street art &quot; will have a lot of <unk> of street art -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all of these people will be here .
and this will happen in the ice . it &apos;s wonderful .
so basically my point is that if you see something that &apos;s not impossible , it &apos;s possible .
all the things that happened in this room were impossible -- this stage , this computer , this <unk> , this <unk> -- were impossible .
everybody in this room made it possible .
I &apos;m not a programmer , and I never had anything to do with any eye movement that understands technology , but I just think of something and linking myself to some amazing people that we can do something about this .
I just want everyone to be in the day , and when you think about something you should do , you should ask yourself questions . if I don &apos;t do it now , when did I do it , who would do it ?
thank you .
as you know , my job is to write children &apos;s books , and actually I &apos;m probably the most widely read of American children .
I often tell people that I don &apos;t want to be a scientist .
you can think of me as a farmer , or as a farmer in a <unk> , but nobody was there .
I &apos;m here today to tell you about recycling and connections .
and it &apos;s usually when you realize that you &apos;re in certain circumstances .
you need to reach out and find an epiphany around .
this is a recycling picture .
a friend of mine drew -- Richard , Linus Torvalds .
it &apos;s complicated . I &apos;m going to tell you .
my cycle came from the 1960s when I was a <unk> high school .
I was one of those people who had been <unk> every week until a teacher got me out of this life .
she pulled me out of this life and put me in the bathroom in the teacher &apos;s room .
and she did .
she did it for three years .
but I had to leave the town .
with expertise , and I had about 85 dollars , and eventually I got my partner , California -- in the &apos; 80s -- and I discovered that working in the AIDS community was necessary .
about three or four years ago , I got a call from that teacher at night , and she said , &quot; I need to see you .
I was so disappointed that we never knew each other as adults .
can you come to the ceremony , and please bring that person that you &apos;ve found ?
I should mention that I have cancer , but I would like to ask you to forget that part .
so the next day we were to Cleveland .
we met her , we talked , and we watched , and we knew she had to come in , you know , she had to come in and relax .
we found her one , brought her back to her and took care of her family because it was necessary .
some things we need to know how to do .
and it was this way of looking at me as an adult , trying to understand my girls and eventually locked in the powder in my hands .
and what happened was that , at the end of the cycle , it formed a circle -- and the epiphany of that epiphany , as I said , was the reaction of the self .
and that epiphany is part of life .
she saved my life , and my friends and I saved her life .
and that &apos;s what life needed .
it needs truth and beauty , and I &apos;m glad that many times has been mentioned .
it also needs -- it requires dignity , love and joy , and our job is to take these sets of <unk> .
thank you .
the ideas behind the computer worms are actually pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want Iran to have nuclear weapons .
they were used to developing the major equipment for nuclear weapons , which was highly centralized in uranium .
the <unk> boxes you see are real @-@ time control .
if we &apos;re trying to hack into these systems of the speed and the valves , we can actually make a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
this <unk> box can &apos;t run Windows software ; they use completely different technologies .
but if we were to try and put a Windows virus on a piece of software engineers for this <unk> laptop , then we could start doing it .
that &apos;s a conspiracy behind the virus .
so I started with a Windows <unk> .
it carried the virus up to the back box , and a centrifuge , and a <unk> delay -- the task .
it &apos;s easy , right ?
and I want to tell you how we found this .
when we started working on viruses about six months ago , we had no idea what it was for .
the only thing it knows is that its Windows section , which is very complex , has been hacked <unk> .
it kind of wants to do something about these <unk> boxes , these real @-@ time control systems .
and this got our attention , and we started a lab project , and we launched the system of the virus , and we ran a very careful examination .
and then something very interesting happened .
the way the viruses show , like the ones that don &apos;t like the <unk> of the virus -- smell , but don &apos;t want to eat .
I don &apos;t understand .
and after we experimented with different <unk> , I realized that this was an active attack .
it &apos;s totally <unk> .
if you find a specific configuration , it will be active to dive into a box , even if it &apos;s trying to get an infection , it &apos;s doing the same thing .
if there wasn &apos;t a target , it didn &apos;t do anything .
and that really caught my attention , and we started working day and night and night on this , because I felt we didn &apos;t know it was the goal .
the goal might be , for example , an American nuclear power plant , or a German chemical factory .
so we better figure out the goal as quickly as possible .
we extract and <unk> the code of the attack , and we see that it contains two digital bombs -- a smaller and smaller one .
and we also discovered that they were made very well understood by the people who knew everything .
they know all the details about what to attack the target .
and they even knew the number of shoes that the operator had .
they know everything .
if you &apos;ve ever heard of it , the complexity of the virus , the complexity of the virus , let me tell you : it &apos;s carrying a virus that &apos;s very complex .
it &apos;s much more than we &apos;ve ever seen .
and here you see the footage of the actual attack code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 50,000 pieces of code .
it looks like old <unk> .
I want to tell you how we can figure out the code .
the first thing we &apos;re going to look for is the system <unk> , because we know what these functions are .
and then we had to find <unk> and <unk> , and then try to connect them to the real world -- to connect with potential reality targets .
so we need to figure out whether or not we can use it to test or not .
and in order to get ideas , we remember that this would be an absolute damaging destruction , so there must be a high @-@ value goal , and there could be a place in Iran , because in Iran &apos;s most viral report .
there aren &apos;t many goals in this area .
it basically reduces the objective down to uranium and nuclear plants and coal plant plants .
and so I said to my assistant , &quot; Get me out of every list of rich and plant experts . &quot;
I had a telephone with them , got them to use their expertise to analyze what we found in code and data .
it works pretty well .
we can connect this little number with the controllers .
this <unk> is the internal sport inside a centrifuge , the black object that you see there .
if you were to control the speed of the pen , you could actually crack the pen and make it even explode .
and we also see the aim of attacking is to make all of this pace slowly slow -- obviously keeping engineers crazy , and they &apos;re not going to quickly identify the problem .
the big numbers are -- we have a chance to understand it in a very careful way .
for example , the numbers are pretty compelling in these code ; they can &apos;t ignore it .
and I started studying how these scientific articles were built in a science paper about <unk> , and found that they were organized in something called an IQ test , and each of which contains a centrifuge on a centrifuge .
that &apos;s a little bit clearly , a match up .
even better match up .
and in Iran , all of these centrifuge are divided into 15 of the so @-@ called <unk> .
guess what we found in the attack code ?
a virtually identical co @-@ assembly structure .
so once again , it &apos;s perfectly match .
this gave us more confidence in what we &apos;re doing .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , it &apos;s not like this .
and these results contain weeks of hard work .
we &apos;re going to walk all the way down to the beginning .
so anyway , we found these two different ways to target the same goals .
the small choose a scaling , the spinning speed up , and then slows it down , and then the adults choose six IQ and manipulating the valves .
in general , we were pretty confident that we knew what the goal was .
it &apos;s a crap . it could be a <unk> .
we don &apos;t worry about what other viruses might be attacking .
some of the really cool stuff that we saw -- something that really blew my mind .
and here &apos;s the <unk> box , and there &apos;s a centrifuge up there .
and the thing about it is that it stops the input from the sensor -- for example , input from pressure sensors and vibrating sensors -- and providing legitimate code that the code is still ongoing in attack , the code is still in the time of the attack , and in fake input data .
in fact , the input data from the computer is pre @-@ viral .
just like the <unk> footage of a Hollywood film , the camera was even recorded a pre @-@ recorded video .
cool , right ?
and it &apos;s certainly not just about the operator in the control room .
it &apos;s actually more dangerous , more predator .
it &apos;s going to be about going around the digital security system .
we need a digital security system where the human operator can &apos;t do enough .
for example , in the power plant , when the great speed of light comes down , it has to be turned on in milliseconds .
obviously , the human operator couldn &apos;t do that .
so here you need the digital security system .
and when they get really damage , the real problem is happening .
the power plant explodes .
the operator and the safety system doesn &apos;t notice .
it &apos;s frightening .
but it gets worse .
and what I &apos;m going to say , is very important .
think about this . this attack is universal .
it doesn &apos;t have to do specific things to uranium in a centrifuge , and it doesn &apos;t have to do anything specifically for uranium or anything .
it will also work , for example , in a power plant or a car .
it &apos;s common .
as an attacker , you don &apos;t need -- doesn &apos;t have to send the virus out , as we saw in the case of the <unk> virus .
you can also be transmitted by conventional worms .
it was as widespread as possible .
and if you do that eventually you have a network of mass destruction .
that &apos;s what we have to deal with .
unfortunately , the biggest goal of these attacks is not in the Middle East .
it &apos;s in the United States , Europe and Japan .
all of these green spaces , these are the areas that target density .
we had to deal with those outcomes , and we &apos;d better be prepared immediately .
thank you .
I have a question .
Ralph <unk> , people thought that was a <unk> .
what do you see ?
Ralph <unk> : okay , you really want to know ?
yeah , OK .
I think it &apos;s not Israel . it &apos;s not Israel .
the back of the networks were the networked back .
only one , that &apos;s America -- luckily , very lucky .
because otherwise , the problems we faced were even more profound .
thank you very much for letting us smile , thank you , Ralph .
in the last few years , I &apos;ve put myself in tough and dangerous situations .
I went to prison -- tough .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
I was photographing in the wars -- neither hard and dangerous .
I had spent the last 30 days eating this food -- which was very interesting at first in the middle , a bit of tough , and finally , very dangerous .
in fact , for most of my career , I &apos;ve spent the most part of my career making myself in the worst condition of my career in getting people to work on social problems , more interesting ways , to try to put these problems in front of the audience .
and so when I learned that I was going to come here and do a TEDTalk about brands and aid , I realized I wanted to make a difference .
some of you may have heard about that a couple of weeks ago , and I ran an ad in <unk> .
and then on Facebook and Twitter , I gave people a chance to buy my TED Talk in 2011 .
yes , some lucky person or company won &apos;t buy the only opportunity in life -- because I &apos;m sure Chris Anderson won &apos;t let the second -- the second thing that you &apos;re seeing when you &apos;re looking at this talk , there &apos;s not a lot of stuff , and there &apos;s not a lot of notes about the subject .
so what you get is this : your <unk> are here : you don &apos;t know anything about my TED Talk , and it determines whether I finally mess it up , and if I give you shame companies and expensive companies , that &apos;s the big possibility .
but then again , this is an amazing opportunity for ad ads .
do you know how many people here are at TED ?
that &apos;s enough .
by the way , this is the headline of the presentation .
and I believe some people will buy it .
if you asked me a year ago , I wouldn &apos;t be as good as this .
but in the new project that I was working on , which is my new film , we have to deal with the marketing world and the bust .
as I said in the last few years , I &apos;ve always come to this horrible situation , but the most dangerous experience I &apos;ve ever had , the most dangerous experience , the most dangerous experience I &apos;ve ever had , compared to the people who are most vulnerable .
you see , I have this idea .
Morgan <unk> : I wanted to make a film about advertising , marketing , video revenues from the ads , marketing and video , came from the commercials , marketing , marketing and an ad campaign .
the name of the movie is going to be the most famous movie ever . &quot;
&quot; top and bottom and top and bottom , &quot; everything has a brand at the beginning of history -- the sponsor of it was a brand .
this brand , <unk> <unk> center ...
and the lives of these people combine the film with this film -- it &apos;s always going to happen forever .
and the movie was this idea of -- Michael O <unk> : what &apos;s there ?
I always say it .
that &apos;s to emphasize that .
it &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just raising the individual brand of the sponsor , but every product in the video of the brand has been sold .
so , we sell a pair of shoes , and that &apos;s the largest shoe ever devised .
the biggest <unk> of all @-@ time movies were the best cars ever made in history , the most beautiful <unk> of all time , and then it became the most &quot; <unk> movie &quot; ever . &quot;
Edith Widder : so that &apos;s more than just showing the brand is part of people &apos;s lives , but it &apos;s raising this brand .
Locke <unk> : in fact , we will show the process of marketing .
this was a shot of transparency .
and in the video , you &apos;re going to see the sequence of the brand marketing .
this was the whole concept of the movie , and it went through the movie .
hope <unk> can help me .
Robert Friedman : it was funny when I first heard it , I thought it was the most profound honor for the audience .
but I don &apos;t know if people can .
Edith Widder : have you ever predicted -- I don &apos;t want to take the word &quot; because it &apos;s got negative colors -- what outcomes do you think that this is created ? &quot;
DR : how much would this film take ?
one and a half million times .
John Kamen : I think it &apos;s going to be very difficult to deal with these brand , but it &apos;s worth looking for these big brands .
<unk> <unk> : who knows , when your movie popped out , we might be a bunch of stupid <unk> .
Locke <unk> : what do you think they will answer ?
Elizabeth <unk> : most of them refused .
Locke <unk> : and the reason they refused was because of me ?
John Kamen : everyone .
Beau Lotto : so much .
sir , can you help me ? I need help .
Michael O <unk> : I can help you .
Beau Lotto : so .
that &apos;s great .
Michael O <unk> : we have to lock the brand .
Locke <unk> : exactly .
you &apos;re going to deal with those people ...
Michael O <unk> : we have a couple of people working in the chain .
turn off the camera .
Locke <unk> : I thought , &quot; turn the camera off &quot; means taking the cameras in private .
as a result , it means , &quot; We don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your film . &quot;
JH : that &apos;s it . these companies one after , they &apos;re gone .
none of them wanted to donate it to the film .
and I was shocked .
they didn &apos;t have any interest in this project .
and I was shocked , I thought the idea of advertising , the idea of advertising , was essentially to put your product in front of as many people as possible to see your product .
in particular in the world today &apos;s online media , shouldn &apos;t there be a new way of shipping information to the masses of people ?
no , it &apos;s just my personal idea .
the problem is , you &apos;re looking at my idea as a deadly mistake here .
in fact , no , that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s not the problem .
this is acceptable .
but this graph represents the problem .
you see , if you search &quot; <unk> &quot; in Google , this is one of the biggest pictures on the search results .
I like your mode , <unk> jacket .
this is the problem : transparency -- the last question of transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , access to information , access to opportunity and access to business -- the last one might be the biggest problem .
you see , recently we hear transparency .
our politicians , our president and even our CEO are using this word .
and yet , at the end of the day , things happened .
why ? transparency is <unk> -- it &apos;s like this bear was frozen , but the bear is dying .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> -- like this strange act on the countryside .
it looked like an extraordinary thing .
so what else is there ?
it was eating ice cream and ice cream all over the place .
it &apos;s pretty bleak .
when I started talking to companies and told them a story , they said , &quot; Oh , we want to tell you a story .
we want you to tell stories , we just want you to tell our stories . &quot;
and when I was a child , my father sometimes realized that I was looking at it all the time -- he was looking at me all the time -- and he said , &quot; Boy , every story has three faces .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , and there &apos;s a real story . &quot;
you see , we want to tell the story with this film .
and only one of the companies were willing to help me -- because I had spent a lot of time with John Allen and Richard <unk> -- and I realized , well , it was better than the fact that I had to skip over my team and run directly with the companies .
and you suddenly start to realize -- or when I started to realize -- you started talking to these companies about your own brands as a universal question .
Locke <unk> : I had two friends of mine filmed the film of Hollywood , and I knew friends like I made small independent movies .
and my friends of the Hollywood movies told me they were successful because of their brands .
and the friends that I made small independent movies said , &quot; How can we make these Hollywood movies ? &quot;
and one of those movies is called &quot; The <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see this brand in this film ?
every time I set out , every time I open my kitchen cabinet , you would see the <unk> body fluids .
and whenever I talk to someone , I would say , &quot; Are you clean enough today ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
let me give you a break .
maybe you can use some of that before we talk about it . &quot;
and we <unk> these <unk> body fluids .
whether it &apos;s &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; heaven &quot; or &quot; heaven , &quot; there &apos;s something for you .
we &apos;re also going to give men the products -- solid , solid , <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> body fluids .
that &apos;s what happens .
now I &apos;m going to answer any of your questions , and let you know what happened .
Frank Gehry : we &apos;re a pretty well known brand .
as you &apos;re talking about the cost of the little movies , we &apos;re just the start of a brand .
we don &apos;t look like other brands .
and the propaganda -- you know , there &apos;s a place where people are looking at beauty -- is something that draws us .
Locke <unk> : which words would you use to describe the brand ?
how about that ?
Frank Gehry : that &apos;s a good question .
woman : cutting edge .
Locke <unk> : technology is not the best way to describe body fluids ; it &apos;s products of people falling into arms .
we talked about <unk> , <unk> .
and I thought , &quot; <unk> , &quot; is the positive and sudden the flow of products , the flow of light , the need for comfort .
it gives you a sense of <unk> .
how do you <unk> your body -- it &apos;s much more <unk> .
all of this can be positive .
that &apos;s a million @-@ dollar corporate group .
so what did a normal person think about me ?
and I had to ask people on the street , and they were like me , the roads were people .
they have to tell them their brand .
Locke <unk> : how would you describe your brand ?
my brand ?
I don &apos;t know .
I liked great dress .
the &apos; 80s combine punk , unless it &apos;s a blessing today .
Locke <unk> : okay , so what is a brand ?
FG : different .
I think it &apos;s my particular style that I think would be &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I love the dark things and gray things .
I usually wear a <unk> , like <unk> , and I like a <unk> .
if there &apos;s a brand , then he might be a classic open buggy .
I &apos;m going to call it &quot; eclectic brand . &quot;
two women : a bit of hippie , a little bit of yoga a bit of Brooklyn -- I don &apos;t know .
I love raising the pets .
my national national bank , even the world .
I think that &apos;s my brand .
in the midst of this <unk> little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
I &apos;m FedEx .
five : <unk> as a writer .
is this a ?
lawyer : my brand is lawyers .
Tom : I am Tom .
Beau Lotto : so we can &apos;t all become Tom &apos;s , but I find myself often the result of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I realized that what I needed was an expert .
a person who could read what I thought was , a person who could really help me understand what a brand means .
so I found a company in Pittsburgh called <unk> .
they &apos;ve helped <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , brand @-@ <unk> , to discover their brand .
if they can help those brands , then they must help me .
<unk> : are you bringing all the pictures right ?
Locke <unk> : I took it . the first picture was my frame .
<unk> <unk> : tell me that this picture has something to do with you .
Locke <unk> : these people helped me create the perception of the world .
<unk> <unk> : what a world like .
<unk> <unk> : the world ? I think your world is the world you live in -- everyone around you , your friends , your family , your lifestyle , your work .
all of this has been a single <unk> , and for me , this place is my home in West Virginia .
next image ?
next one : this is my happiest day .
<unk> <unk> : what does that relate to your perception ?
Locke <unk> : what kind of people I wanted to be .
I love novelty .
I love weird things .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; why &quot; -- what does this help us ?
so what does that represent ? which stage are you generating for ?
why is that important ? what is the red color ?
let me explain that part .
what doesn &apos;t match your style ?
what have you experienced ?
it &apos;s not necessarily fear . what kind of rollercoaster am you sitting on ?
Beau Lotto : so !
<unk> <unk> : thank you for your patient .
tan Le : yeah .
well , I don &apos;t know what the end result is .
there &apos;s so much complex about that .
left <unk> : the first sketch of this idea is that there are two distinct pieces of your brand each other -- Morgan <unk> &apos;s brand is a brand , or a brand of ideas .
these two great combine .
it &apos;s almost like a <unk> .
I think some companies are worth one of them , and they &apos;re not always the same .
most companies tend to -- and this is what happens -- avoid the fact that they can &apos;t get their sense of fear and so on , and you &apos;re the opposite , and you actually turn it into a <unk> machine , which is great .
so what are the same brands ?
the first is the classic , Apple .
and then there &apos;s also Target , the <unk> dome , and there &apos;s also <unk> .
some brands are &quot; <unk> , &quot; some brand has a depth of mind , and these brand aren &apos;t long , but a depth of ideas and a brand has power .
Locke <unk> : a brand of ideas , then what about your brand ?
what if somebody asked you to describe your brand , your brand personality , what would you describe ?
are you annoyed ? are you going to make you happy ?
or is it a static brand ?
are your brand cleaner , your <unk> , your conservative brand ?
the brand is more often like the novelty in the <unk> , the novelty <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the magic and the magic .
or are your brand more unstable ?
you &apos;re James Bond @-@ like , you know ?
do you have a <unk> , a traditional , <unk> , like &quot; Oprah &quot; ?
do you deserve to be trusted , stable , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , like the Dalai Lama or <unk> ?
we &apos;ve discovered over 100 million companies in this film , and they say , &quot; No , they don &apos;t want to have anything to do with it .
they don &apos;t want to have anything to do with it , because they don &apos;t have control , they don &apos;t have control .
but ultimately , we ended up with 17 companies who were willing to hand over and give control to people like me who are both ideas and people like me , and they were able to tell the stories of the stories , the power of the storytelling , the stories that we didn &apos;t know about -- the advertisers never go out .
they tell us a story about the neurological part of the brain that we introduced in the film about how they first used MRI to find brain regions that control desire in your brain , and then to act in ad @-@ hoc movies .
we went to Rio de Janeiro .
this city didn &apos;t have any billboards in the last five years , pasted any posters , nothing .
and we went to the school district , and there were companies trying to put ads in all of America &apos;s fiscal tensions .
what blew my mind was , let me get the most feedback or the biggest bang for what I had for myself .
and that &apos;s what the brand does .
they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , thought , maybe these <unk> aren &apos;t giving my benefits .
I &apos;m going to play directly with artists .
and I was going to create a fascinating film with him that made a difference in the way we think about the world .
what did this have for people ? did it succeed ?
and the movie was on the <unk> , and let &apos;s see .
according to the amount of data , the film has been released since January -- it &apos;s not the whole movie -- we get the press about nine billion stories of the movie .
all the stories add up to two and a half weeks .
and that &apos;s just what happens on the Internet -- not including <unk> , television .
it wasn &apos;t even released .
there &apos;s not online .
and no other countries came out .
and the last film has received a broad range of attention .
this was a good test for an ad ad in which we were looking for an ad agency at the time , and the client didn &apos;t want to participate .
I always believe that if you dare try and take risks , these risks become opportunities .
I believe that when you don &apos;t let people take risks , you &apos;re pushing them towards failure .
and I believe that when you educate your staff , you &apos;re not about adventure , you &apos;re putting the benefits of the whole company at risk .
I think we want to make progress , and we have to encourage people to take risks .
we have to encourage people not to be afraid of seemingly dangerous opportunities .
finally , I think we have to be confronted with fear .
I had to put that bear in the cage .
the fear is faced with a fear of fear .
a section , a breath of risk .
and finally , we have to embrace transparency .
now , a little bit more faith than ever had , a little bit of faith , is a powerful life .
and I said , through a whole talk of creativity and transparency , my whole talk has been about , &quot; <unk> transparency , &quot; funded by my good friends in <unk> and they submitted speeches at <unk> dollars .
<unk> : big data , big opportunities for global entrepreneurs .
embracing transparency for you .
thank you very much .
Jean <unk> : so where exactly is the zero @-@ sum goal for zero dollars ?
Locke <unk> : that &apos;s a great question .
I have a check in my pocket that &apos;s a <unk> from TED &apos;s seed foundation , and that &apos;s a check for my next year at TED .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I proposed that with my boss to do something about art and museum , and my boss was here today and she agreed .
it took 18 months .
I &apos;ve been through a lot of interesting negotiations and stories , and I can tell you about nine countries , and I &apos;ve got 17 really interesting museum experiences .
but I want to thank you for the first time .
I can tell a lot of stories about why we &apos;re doing this .
my personal story is very simple in the slide of how to enter it .
I grew up in India .
and I got a great education , and I didn &apos;t want to complain about what , but I didn &apos;t have a lot of opportunities for these museum and artwork .
so when I had the opportunity to travel a lot , I learned a lot .
and when I was working at Google , I was able to combine technology and make it easier for people to come and visit ideas .
so we built a team , a wonderful team , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to get into the demo and tell you a few interesting stories about how it started .
so it &apos;s simple . you go to <unk>
you see all these museums .
you see the museum , you see New York , the Museum of Modern Art , the museum of the Netherlands , the museum of the museum , the museum of the museum .
now let me go to one of my favorites , the New York Museum of Art .
there are two ways to go , very simple .
click , bang , you go into the museum .
wherever you are in Mumbai , Mexico , is fine .
you &apos;re walking around . you &apos;re enjoying it .
you want to follow a line in the museum .
you click on it . you blow it up .
you go in , you want to go to the edge of the hallway .
go on and play .
explore .
thank you . I haven &apos;t talked about the best parts .
now I was faced with a painting of my favorite paint by Peter <unk> .
and I saw this plus .
if the museum gave us imagery , you click on it .
and here &apos;s one of the images .
here &apos;s all the metadata .
if you &apos;re really interested in this artwork , you can click on here , but now I &apos;m going to lock it up .
this is an image we took , and this is what we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> technique .
for example , this image , almost 100 million pixels .
a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you get from 100 billion pixels ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to show you what 100 million pixels are showing you right now .
you can contract a temporary form .
you see something interesting .
I love this guy . his face is valuable .
but you really want to go further .
so I looked around and I saw what was happening here .
and I said , &quot; Wait a sec . &quot;
close to here , I started noticing what these kids are throwing .
and I looked at it , talking to a few people in the museum , and it turns out that this was a game called <unk> <unk> , and it was a tough <unk> on the side of a tough day .
and it was pretty popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something .
and now it gets deeper , and you can see the scale goes up .
now let me show you a little bit of the vision , and I &apos;m going to zoom out , and you can actually see it all .
this is where we are , and this is the painting .
the best part is not yet , wait a minute .
now let &apos;s go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
another one of my favorites is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m just going to give you an example of the details .
so what if you want to see the sofa ?
and if you want to see how <unk> actually created this masterpiece .
you zoom in . you really zoom in .
and I got to the most favorite part of my favorite part , and I could really see the <unk> curve .
this is &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I thought , I never saw it .
I &apos;m going to introduce you to another function that I like .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff . I don &apos;t have time to go through it .
this is one of the really cool parts , called the collection .
any of you , no matter whether you &apos;re rich or poor , whether you have a gorgeous house or not .
you can come in and create your own online museum in these pieces .
it &apos;s simple . you come in and create this force called <unk> , and you can see it everywhere .
this is the <unk> of the National Gallery .
you can write little <unk> and send friends to friends and really talk about the sense of your work .
so I want to conclude by saying that to me , the main thing is that these remarkable works are not from Google .
personally , I don &apos;t even think of it as a museum .
I &apos;m probably not supposed to say that .
it really came from these artists .
and that &apos;s what I felt during the process .
I mean , I want the digital media to be able to show their artwork at the right time .
and the biggest question I &apos;ve got today is , &quot; Are you doing this for a museum experience ? &quot;
my answer was no .
it &apos;s a replacement experience .
and I said , thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of the brain . your brain can split into two parts .
the left hemisphere is responsible for reason , and the right brain , primarily responsible intuition .
if we measure the power of the brain with scales , and we mark our brains .
for example , it means that somebody is completely rational .
that means somebody &apos;s completely emotional .
so where do you put your brain online ?
some people might choose one of those extremes , but I think most of you in the audience , your brain needs to be roughly similar -- two brains simultaneously have very high potential .
they &apos;re not likely to dismiss or anything else .
you can be rational and emotional .
and I thought that since I was a quantum physicist , like most other quantum physicists , had great ideas that could link those complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we also need a good intuition to actually test the experiments .
so how do we raise that intuition ? well , we like to study things .
we study and processes in ourselves , and we look at how it responds , and then we lift our intuition .
you actually do the same thing .
some of the intuitions that you may have been nurturing for many years is just one thing that comes out at the same time .
I mean , it &apos;s kind of weird to think about something that can happen at the same time in two different places , but you &apos;re not born with this idea , you &apos;re a breeding product .
I remember seeing a child playing in a van .
he was also just a toddler that wasn &apos;t good enough , and he fell down .
but I bet and <unk> play gives him a very valuable lesson , which is that large objects don &apos;t get you through and they stay in a place .
this is a model that exists in the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
and that &apos;s also a really bad model for the particle physicists , because they &apos;re not looking at the <unk> , they &apos;re looking at the little particles .
and when they looked at their particles , they thought they were doing all kinds of really bizarre things -- as if they could penetrate the wall , or they could come up at the same time .
they were recording these discoveries , and they made a theory called quantum mechanics .
this is the cutting edge of physics a few years ago ; you need quantum mechanics to describe little , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need it to describe those gigantic , everyday objects around you .
and that doesn &apos;t really match my intuition , maybe because I don &apos;t look too often at the particles .
well , I still study them sometimes , but it &apos;s just not normal .
and I never saw them .
I mean , nobody can see the particles .
but that doesn &apos;t exactly match my logic .
because if everything is made up of the particles , and each of the particles that follow the quantum theory of quantum mechanics , then should anything not follow quantum theory ?
I couldn &apos;t find why it didn &apos;t follow .
so I know better about the whole thing , and if we use something in a way that tells us that everything in the day is inherently quantum theory .
not long ago , I started .
I built this .
this is the first thing you can see and the result of quantum mechanics .
what we see here is a computer chip .
and you can see that little bit in the middle .
that &apos;s the metal I &apos;m going to talk about in the next couple .
this is a picture of it .
focus a little bit . we see that at the center there .
and it &apos;s a close @-@ up and close @-@ up of the observations .
what we see here is a piece of metal , it looks like a waterfall board , and it gains one end .
I made these metals almost like the same way I made computer chips .
I was manipulating a silicon chip , and I was <unk> all of these large machines for about 100 hours .
in the end of the result , I had to create my own machine -- at the bottom of the a swimming tank .
this device has the ability to layer the quantum layer , but it needs some help to do it .
let me give you an example .
do you know how uncomfortable it is in a crowded elevator ?
I mean , when I was a person in the elevator , I could do all kinds of weird things , but when other people came in , I stopped doing these things because I didn &apos;t want to fuss about other people , or , frankly , to other people .
so quantum mechanics suggests that non @-@ living organisms change the same way .
the passengers who are not living organisms are not just people , but it also contains the light and the heat of the wind and the space .
so if we want to see the properties of quantum mechanics , we have to wipe out all the other passengers .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
we turn off the lights , and we put it in a <unk> and we pull out all the air , and then we cool it up to a little bit cooler .
now , in the elevator , little songs can do anything that it wants to do .
we measured its motion .
we found it in a very peculiar way of motion .
it &apos;s vibrating , not completely static . it &apos;s vibrating like this -- like a solid gold ring .
just to give it a slight bang , we can make it vibrate and not vibrating -- something that only happens in quantum mechanics .
what I &apos;m here to tell you about is something wonderful .
what does a thing vibrate at once and not vibration sound ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
an example : all the atoms made up of billions of times are still static and those atoms are moving up and down .
they &apos;re only exactly the same time .
the rest of the time they &apos;re <unk> .
that means every atom is in two different places at the same time , and further illustrates that the full spectrum is two positions .
and I think that &apos;s really cool .
it &apos;s true .
and what I &apos;ve been doing for all of these years is something that &apos;s worth setting up because , look at the difference between a single atom and a <unk> are about as bad as the number of parts of your individual individual .
so if the single individual position is at the same time in two different positions , then that &apos;s why you can &apos;t ?
I mean , that &apos;s just the logic of my reason thinking .
so what if you could be in multiple positions at the same time ?
how are you going to deal with the bugs in your own space ?
this is part of the story .
when we heat it up and open the lights in the box , we see that the alternatives are still one element .
so I had to create a new intuition , and it seemed that all the objects in the elevator were actually tucked in a tiny cosmos .
you &apos;ve heard a lot about how quantum physics explains everything connected .
well , that &apos;s not exactly right .
it &apos;s more widespread than that , more profound .
and that &apos;s the connection , the connections that you have around you , the real definition of who you are , and that &apos;s the deep science of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , I think we needed to reimagine the economic development of our consciousness .
our new goals should be dedicated to where every family thinks about where they &apos;re working and what they &apos;re working , they have at least five different cities where they can choose to be competitive new cities .
and we have a long way to go about that .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t have cities that want to embrace them .
but the amazing thing about cities is how much more valuable it is than building value .
so we can easily create a number of New World , or hundreds of miles .
you might think that sounds ridiculous , if you &apos;ve never thought of it before .
but this is just the building blocks for the city .
imagine half the people who wanted to live in an apartment ; half of them weren &apos;t there .
you can try to scale up the area .
but you know that you &apos;re dealing with the housing and the surrounding site , the law is protected from the legal preservation and the entertainment of the building .
it &apos;s a very difficult thing to do .
but you can create a new building in uncharted territory , like the beginning of the <unk> .
so I proposed that the government set up enough parts of the new city and called the Charter city .
about the same time I &apos;ve learned about this , the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> are thinking about planning in Honduras .
it &apos;s said that about 75,000 people a year come to the United States every year , and they want to ask them what they can do to make sure that these people stay in Honduras for the same work .
and one time the <unk> said to the Tower , &quot; What if we were to take our vacant land -- what if we gave it to the embassy -- some American embassy ; some American embassy ; some them for the Canadian embassy ; if you want to look for jobs in Canada or the United States of America , could they find their jobs , or the American Embassy , or the American embassy jobs , or the American embassy jobs , or the American embassy jobs , or the American embassy jobs , or the American embassy
2009 was the summer of Honduras through a military coup attempt .
the next rule , the next rule , <unk> , won the difference between the election and the peace and the peace and the peace and the peace talks .
and he invited the <unk> to be his essay .
and at the same time , I was preparing a TEDGlobal Talk .
and through a series of improvements , a lot of users , I was trying to take the idea of the Charter complex idea and break the essence of the fundamental essence of the city .
the first is that the significance of the law , as it said , is that you can &apos;t penetrate the households .
we &apos;re focusing on new technologies , but new technologies require technology and demand implementation . it &apos;s usually the ones that are asking us to pull our way back .
in 2010 , a friend of Guatemala gave it to the <unk> for a TEDTalk .
he showed it to the <unk> .
they called me .
and we said , &quot; Let &apos;s show this to our president . &quot;
we touched the conference room in a hotel room in Miami in December .
I tried to explain how much the value of the city is and how much it costs .
and I showed this slide a valuable area like New York , and notice that in some cases , tens of thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it &apos;s a roughly abstract discussion when some <unk> in the valley says , &quot; Paul , maybe we can watch a TEDTalk . &quot;
and in a simple way , the Charter for Compassion begins to start with an uninhabited agreement that people chose whether or not they were in the next place .
and the president of Honduras asked me the question of the asking of the question that we need for this project , and that &apos;s the key to the way our country moved forward .
I was invited to visit Louise <unk> , this project on January Four , April 14th , the five .
and I showed you another example of this slide , and try to tell the view , and if you want to create a huge value in the city , it has to be a big deal .
this is a picture of <unk> , and this is an airport in Denver , New Orleans .
there are more than 100 square kilometers of space in this single airport .
I tried to convince the President of Honduras , if you &apos;re going to build a <unk> square kilometer in at least 1,000 square miles .
that &apos;s two and a half million acres .
everyone was very polite and foolish .
the expression of the audience is serious and critical .
and the President of the meeting said , &quot; Father <unk> , thank you for your lecture , but maybe we can take a TEDTalk .
I have a laptop now . &quot;
so I sat down and they had a TEDTalk .
it also captured the essence of the new city as a new city of choice .
it &apos;s a choice that you &apos;re going to go to , perhaps in Honduras instead of <unk> .
it gave birth to a new choice for leaders .
because the leaders of Honduras &apos; government need a Charter for beneficial benefit from the values that help them set up and implement the Charter for everybody to believe that the Charter will actually act .
and the way the President <unk> has learned about their ability to implement it is that I think the way a city which is as important as the city of the city that has been built for years of fear and doubt is as important as the different parties of the fear and doubt .
we went through that area .
this is a photograph there .
it &apos;s a thousand square @-@ kilometer .
not long after , January 19 , they voted in the parliament and provided a legal support for specific development .
in this country where they had just experienced the coup government , it was <unk> times more than one .
all the parties , all the parties , all of them , disagree .
as part of the Constitution , you actually need twice in Congress .
and on February 17th , they passed the Act two and a half .
and immediately after the vote , the 21st of February 21 to 24 , about 30 individual veterans come to two of the most interesting parts of the world .
one was Korea .
this is a big , new downtown town in Korea -- bigger than Boston .
all you &apos;ve just seen has been building for four years , but they &apos;ve spent four years building .
another attractive construction sector is Singapore .
they &apos;ve actually built two <unk> in China and are ready to build the third .
and if you think about it rationally , that &apos;s our situation .
they had an site and they had thought of building it into the second city .
they &apos;re entering an legal app that allows the managers to come in as well as a legal system as well .
a country has been dedicated to the Supreme Court for this new justice system and became the poster for the final appeal .
this is a city designer and an architect interested in it .
and these even gave them some economic support .
but one of the things that you know about early diagnosis was a lot of rejection .
there &apos;s a lot of businesses that are intention to go to the United States specifically to the free trade areas , and a lot of people want to go there .
there are seven billion people around the world who want to be forever immigrants to some other places .
a million people went from Latin America every year .
many of them are the fathers who are far from home to work for a job -- sometimes single mothers who earn money for a living .
sadly , even the children are trying to live their parents for a long time and a long time , for decades , for decades .
how is this a vision for a house in Honduras ?
or create tens of billions of dollars or so around the world , create hundreds of these hundreds of them ?
what is another vision for every family that has a number of competing opportunities for a new city ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my Honduras &apos; friends , thank you , TED .
hello . I &apos;m Kevin <unk> . I &apos;m a YouTube trend manager , and my profession is watching YouTube videos .
it &apos;s true .
so today we &apos;re going to talk about why some video appeared online and maybe even important .
we all wanted to be a celebrity -- celebrity , singer , comedian -- and it was very , very difficult to do when I was young .
but now the online video is making it real , so anyone can be creative to do what you want to be famous to be part of the world .
any of you can be famous on the Net , on Saturday .
but there are over 48 hours of video a minute of YouTube .
and in so many , only the tiniest proportion of the number of times that appeared all over the world and recorded as a culture of <unk> .
how did that happen ?
three keys : <unk> , community engagement and unexpected outcomes .
okay , let &apos;s see .
Mr. <unk> gas : Oh , my God . Oh my God . Oh my God .
Oh , my God !
ooh !
Oh , Whoa !
last year , Mr. <unk> gas ran this video of the park outside of his <unk> Park .
in 2010 , this video was seen three million times .
this chart shows the video just happened in the fashion show .
but the bear didn &apos;t have to photograph that appeared online .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what the people who claim to be a self @-@ organization are doing .
he also put a lot of video .
this video was actually posted last January .
so what happened ?
that &apos;s Jimmy <unk> .
Jimmy <unk> draws a tweet to the video .
because there are the leaders like Jimmy <unk> showed us the fresh and interesting things that give the audience access to these things .
Rebecca <unk> : it &apos;s Friday , Friday , Friday . play is on Friday . everyone &apos;s expected to have a weekend , weekends , Friday , Friday , Friday , Friday , Friday . Kevin : if there &apos;s no video , you &apos;re not sure we &apos;re going to have the next conversation .
<unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;s &quot; Friday &quot; was one of the Year &apos;s Eve .
this year almost 200 million views .
this chart shows the popular trend .
and it seemed like a video somewhere in the sky of a gentleman &apos;s &quot; <unk> , &quot; that the video went off of the red .
what happened that day ?
Oh , that was that day , a Friday , really .
if you &apos;ve questioned the peak , those were on Friday .
but what happened on that day ?
it was chosen , and many tribal <unk> have spoken about it .
the mysteries of the scientific opera , Michael <unk> , was playing on Twitter .
the point is that there was a or a crowd of <unk> that looked at the video and shared their views , sped up the red light coming through the red tiger .
and this group creates a shared joke , not only is it talking about it , but it <unk> its own version .
so there &apos;s now a million volumes of <unk> on &quot; Friday &quot; on YouTube .
and even on Monday , there &apos;s a different kind of funny imitation of that .
it &apos;s not like a one @-@ way entertainment media in the 20th century , and it &apos;s a collective engagement that makes us a part of a common phenomenon -- transmitted or intentional innovation .
this &quot; <unk> &quot; is an actual music series for a series of animations .
that &apos;s it , just that .
up to 50 million times this year .
and if you think that &apos;s incredible , you &apos;re much more difficult to imagine this video and a third @-@ hour version that attracted four million people .
and even the <unk> watched the video .
the cat is watching this other cat .
but the most important thing about this is this technology that motivates ideas , the technology , the web culture .
and it &apos;s also being made .
somebody made nostalgia .
and then we walked along the route .
the whole <unk> red is what made it possible to be a joke that everybody can make .
because now we &apos;re not only <unk> , but we &apos;re also involved .
who knew this ?
who knew that &quot; <unk> , &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; or &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
what kind of script do you write will contain all this ?
it &apos;s only two days a minute of this video of the Internet , and it &apos;s unique and unique enough to have an image .
a friend of mine advised a great video of a great <unk> by a guy in New York City , and I had to admit I hadn &apos;t been interested in .
Casey <unk> : I had a ticket because I didn &apos;t have a bicycle on the bike lanes , but often because a lot of obstacles don &apos;t even get you on the bike lanes .
Kevin <unk> : in an unexpected way , the idea and the argument attracted 500 million nights .
and this is the way it applies to every aspect of our innovation .
so the question that motivates us to have this ...
Mr. <unk> gas : what does that mean ?
Oh ...
Kevin : what does that mean ?
the wave of ideas , of engagement groups , and of the <unk> , these are the characteristics of new media and new <unk> that people can participate in and define what &apos;s happening in the audience .
as I do , it &apos;s Justin Bieber now comes from a <unk> of YouTube .
your ideas don &apos;t need people .
we all have autonomy in popular culture .
but it wasn &apos;t the characteristics of the old media , and it wasn &apos;t exactly what the media is today , but they must be the entertainment of the future media .
thank you .
it was 10 minutes old enough for me to tell you about the three generations of women , the amazing strength of this ties , the four @-@ year @-@ olds and her mother , the grandmother tied them together , five days a boat in a little girl who &apos;s been waiting for the last 30 years -- not even in your mind today &apos;s San Francisco .
a constant story .
it &apos;s like a puzzle that &apos;s being <unk> .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
the first image in retrospect was a man doing the work .
he &apos;s a poet and playwright who commit life to the unity and freedom of the country .
imagine him as a communist , he was facing his whole life completely abandoned .
the ridicule of friends .
he was silence .
he was dead as history .
he was my grandfather .
I never understood his real life .
but our lives are richer than memory .
my grandfather gave me his life .
and my responsibility was to not let his experience loose and my responsibility was to learn from history , and history tried to defeat us all the time .
the next piece of a puzzle was the dawn of the morning , <unk> in the sea .
my mother , <unk> , 18 @-@ year @-@ olds , had two young girls .
and the only purpose of her life was to flee the family in Australia .
it was just impossible for her .
so , four years of <unk> &apos;s long story , a long boat in the ocean , a boat @-@ boat @-@ boat fishing .
the big people know the dangers are .
the biggest threat was pirates , rape and death .
like all adults , my mother had a little poison .
if we were cremated , my sister , my mother and so on .
my first memory came from a small boat -- the motors , the ups and downs , the sea level .
I don &apos;t remember Viking came a few times , but it was attacked by the men on the ship , and the engine was turned around in six hours .
but I remember the trip of the oil <unk> lure ; it was a young <unk> from the coast of Malaysia ; it was the first apple ; the first apple , a man from <unk> .
no longer eat that delicious apple .
three months after the refugee camp , we settled in Melbourne .
the next piece of this puzzle is a new life that women create in three generations .
settled in <unk> , a working @-@ class suburban development , dominated by migration .
unlike the rest of the <unk> suburbs , I forgot my existence , forget about power .
the store <unk> tastes like a different world .
speaking of the same kind of <unk> English , people are communicating . one thing is the same , it begins again .
and the mother started working in rural areas , and then went to the bus park for six days , and came back in .
and sometimes she would learn English , and she got the IT <unk> .
we &apos;re very poor .
every dollar saved . the rest of the money was spent just getting old English and math , no matter what , even without new clothes , wearing <unk> .
I was a kid in an old school and a hole in another pair .
the school uniforms cover the lap because it &apos;s six years .
and it was a very small number , but it was a couple of times , and some graffiti said , &quot; Asian people go home . &quot;
where do you go home ?
something <unk> my mind .
a force pulls in , quiet sound is saying , &quot; I &apos;m going to pass you over you . &quot;
my sister and my sister and my mother slept in the same bed .
mothers bring their homes home every night , but one day we &apos;re talking to each other , and we &apos;re listening to the acoustic rooms of the <unk> .
my mother suffered from the nightmare , which was all about the boat .
my job was to stay awake , wake her as she had nightmares .
she opened a computer store , she went to school to learn how to play a <unk> .
there &apos;s no story about men , no transition , angry , dull , questions like the world .
ask for funding and aid .
they built the center .
I live in a parallel world .
on the one hand , I &apos;m a typical Asian student , I found myself in particular .
on the other hand , I suffered from the dangers of reality , the tragedies of violence , the accumulation of drugs and apartheid .
but years of help .
when I was graduating from college , I was selected as a young Australian youth .
I jumped right from one piece to the other , no beautiful connection .
<unk> <unk> is an average citizen , and now refugees , social activists are invited to speak , to a place never heard of .
I don &apos;t know the deal .
I don &apos;t know how to use <unk> .
you don &apos;t talk about wine .
it &apos;s not speaking .
I wanted to go back to the original , <unk> of suburbia -- the grandmother , present and two daughters for 20 years , talking about each other , talking about the past , getting to sleep in a bed , three of us still in a bed .
I told my mother , I couldn &apos;t do it .
and she reminded me that she took us a boat out of the boat , which is my age right now .
no choice .
her name was <unk> , and she said , &quot; Be the real self . &quot;
so I talked about the job @-@ earning and education issues of the edges of the group and the <unk> of political rights .
the more honest I &apos;m talking about , the more I &apos;m talking about .
they meet people , do what they like , what they live .
even though I completed my studies , I realized that I couldn &apos;t be limited to law .
here &apos;s another puzzle clip .
and at the same time , I realized that as outliers , the news on the screen recently is not just news , but something has come from a boat .
because being a <unk> is too easy to give up your vision , it &apos;s easy to get your assumptions .
I have to stand now in the comfort zone , and yes , the world starts fragmented , not exactly what you &apos;re worried about .
you &apos;re not allowed to <unk> or stimulate the possibility .
there &apos;s energy , ruthless optimism , mix of people and the courage .
follow my hunch .
I gathered a group of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and the only challenge we had .
for a year , we were not alone .
and every day , at the end of the day , I was doing a whole bunch of people .
every night trying to work .
most of our ideas are crazy , and a few are smart , and we breakthrough .
I felt like moving to America .
after a trip .
and my intuition succeeded again and again .
I arrived in three months and went on taking risks .
at the end , let me tell you my grandmother .
she grew up in the age of fields , and she was the biggest of them .
centuries of life had never changed .
she was born and her father died .
it was raised by the mother alone .
she married an old girl who was 17 years old and was replaced by a <unk> , by the way .
there was no husband &apos;s support , taking her husband to the court , <unk> herself , and winning her reputation as well .
impossible is possible .
and when she was in Melbourne 600 miles away , I was shower in Sydney .
through the glass , I saw her standing across .
and I know she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she was , she , she was , she was , she , she , she , she , she , she was , she was , she , she was , she was , she was
my mom &apos;s phone rang a few minutes later .
and a few days later , we went to <unk> , and we sat next to her coffin .
we tell the story , and we promise her all the time .
and the night nurse told us , he had to cover the coffin .
my mother had given us the hand of the grandmother .
and she asked the question , &quot; Why the grandmother &apos;s hand is Van , so cool elsewhere ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been packing it since the morning . &quot;
&quot; you never let go . &quot;
if we have mobility in our family , it must be for women .
if we think about the fabric of ourselves and life , we can now see that a man has to cut us apart . it has to frustrated us .
failure is too easy .
now I want my child , my own little boat .
who would not ?
and I was afraid of privilege , privilege and power .
put the paddle in their life , brave enough to get every wave , natural , <unk> engines , <unk> vision , no <unk> , can I do it ?
I don &apos;t know .
but I could leave it alone and look at their safety , which I hope .
and at the same time , what &apos;s happening here today , it &apos;s the fourth and the <unk> .
today I want to share with you a little bit of my photographic work .
or is this a photograph ?
because it &apos;s obviously a photograph , but it &apos;s a photograph you didn &apos;t take with a camera .
however , my interest in photography started when I got the first digital cameras , I was 15 years old .
it was buried in my passion for painting , but it was a little different because the whole process of using the camera is already ahead .
when you take a camera and you shoot the camera , the whole process is over .
so it seemed to me that photography was a much more appropriate space and time .
I think anyone can do it .
so I wanted to do something special because the whole thing was just the moment when you beat the shoot .
this is a photo of a busy highway .
but it was surprising .
but nonetheless , it remains a sense of the <unk> .
or a photograph like this has colors and color , but it &apos;s all about trying to preserve a sense of <unk> .
and what I &apos;m talking about is the probability of the photograph .
because it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but I always wanted to make it look like soap is captured in some way .
these pictures need you to quickly identify the skills behind them .
so what &apos;s more about it is capturing a moment of inspiration than capturing a moment of reality .
but what does it take to make these pictures look realistic ?
is it about detail ? is it about color ?
or is it about light ?
what caused this illusion ?
sometimes different perspectives create different hallucinations .
but ultimately , it &apos;s going to be falling down to how we understand the world and how we understand it in a two @-@ dimensional space .
it &apos;s not about what it is , it &apos;s about what we think looks like .
so I think these ingredients are simple .
I think of it as a jigsaw in the real world , where you can put different pieces of the real world together and create another reality .
let me give you a simple example .
there are three of them completely visible and real objects , and we can find them in the real three @-@ dimensional world .
but if you combine these objects in a way , you can create visual objects that are still three @-@ dimensional objects , as if it exists .
but at the same time we know it &apos;s impossible .
and we &apos;re cheating our brains , because the brain is an object that doesn &apos;t exist .
the same thing is happening here .
it &apos;s really just a different picture .
so what makes a photo look like the things that we normally don &apos;t even think of as well , but in our daily life .
but when we combine that , it &apos;s worth thinking about it , otherwise it looks odd .
and what I want to suggest is that we have to follow three simple principles in order to achieve what that might look like .
you see , these images are not special .
but together they can create something like this .
so the first principle is that all of the photographs that are taken together show the same view .
secondly , there &apos;s the same amount of light that comes from a combination of two .
these two pictures match both of them exactly the same height and the same amount of light they were given in .
and the third principle is , it &apos;s hard to see the bridge in these different images and make the bridge look <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense for anybody to tell us how this image is made .
with the colors at the edge of a photo array , the <unk> and the brightness , and once again , the depth of the eye , the colors and the noise that we see , we can take away the boundary between different photographs and make it look like a single photograph , even though there &apos;s hundreds of photos .
here &apos;s another example .
some of you might think that this is just a piece under the bottom of a sticker .
but this photograph is actually taken from many different places .
I personally think that creating a place is easier than finding a place , because you don &apos;t have to deal with your brain .
but it really takes a lot of planning .
and last winter came up with this idea , and I knew that I had a few months of time to plan this thing , basically to go to different places and find a picture of this puzzle .
this fish was , like , a <unk> .
the shore is taking another site .
the underwater part was a quarry .
and by the way , I put it in red and made it look more wind in Sweden .
and in order to do that , what I think is most important is plan .
it &apos;s always going to come up with an idea and an idea .
and that &apos;s a different picture .
every one of these pictures is taken very carefully .
and if you can get a good photo , it works beautifully , and it looks pretty much like that .
so all the tools , all of the tools , are within that only limit our imagination .
thank you .
I want to talk to you about why so many digital healthcare programs failed .
and one of the most important things I think is that we don &apos;t listen to patients .
one of the things that we did at the University of Holland was appointed a chief listening officer .
not in a very scientific way -- she has a coffee or tea over the patient , family , relatives , family and relatives ?
what needs us to help ? &quot;
and I think we &apos;d like to think that &apos;s one of the main reasons why almost all of the electronic healthcare programs fail , is that we don &apos;t listen to .
this is my <unk> weight , which is a simple thing .
here &apos;s a switch .
I weigh it every morning .
<unk> , I set myself a <unk> , as you can see .
I set the weight up .
in fact , the whole operation was very simple , and it sent my data to Google Health .
and at the same time , as a doctor , he could receive , and he could see what was wrong with my weight , not just wait for the weight of a heart attack like a heart attack , but all the way up the road .
but here &apos;s another thing .
some of you may know that I have <unk> fans on Twitter .
so every morning I used the <unk> weight , and before I got in my van , people started talking to me , &quot; I think you &apos;re lunch or Jane . &quot;
but that &apos;s a great thing , because it &apos;s a peer @-@ to @-@ peer pressure that can help patient -- it helps to treat obesity and help someone quit smoking .
but on the other hand , it can bring people together in some of these games to make it even better to keep healthy .
the next week , the next week has to be added .
there would be a little bit like this , connected to a smartphone or other equipment , and it happened .
and then people measured their blood pressure in their home , and they sent it to their doctor , and they shared it as long as 100 dollars .
and that &apos;s the key thing , when the patient is collecting data , they &apos;re not just self @-@ control , they &apos;re not just going to help us to deal with the challenges that we have in our healthcare care , like the cost of medicine or the need and so on .
we &apos;re going to make technology easy to motivate the patients that are already there .
you can do it with technology , and you can distribute it to ordinary people .
today I &apos;m going to show you a short project that we &apos;ve done .
we have instruments in our cars .
they even have cell phones .
we know where every ATM comes from .
you know where all the gas stations are .
of course , fast food .
but where are the remains of the <unk> of the patient recently ?
we &apos;ve been asking and nobody knows .
no one knew that I was going to be able to save my life , and that &apos;s now possible .
we &apos;re going to be sent to the Dutch mission .
we built a website and said , &quot; If you see an <unk> , please place it online , and it &apos;s open time , &quot; because it &apos;s not necessarily opened 24 hours .
in the Netherlands , there are <unk> labeled .
the next step is to develop the apps .
we developed an iPad app .
an <unk> app , <unk> <unk> , looking for <unk> .
if you saw someone fall in <unk> , you could get a phone in the iPhone a couple of weeks , and Microsoft &apos;s cell phones could find recently saving lives .
what I want to talk to you about today is not just the name of that product , but the name of that product and the name of the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to push this project around the world .
and we &apos;re also calling to colleagues and universities all over the world to help us think together to come up with wild symbols around the world .
so when you go out and you see somebody out there , maybe your family or just your way , you find your family .
and here we also wanted to call for every company in the world to test these results .
for example , maybe sending a <unk> or a <unk> to see if the flag was still there .
so please help us not only make us healthy , but we can master them with them .
thank you .
today , I &apos;m going to talk about some unexpected discoveries .
now I &apos;m working in the solar system .
the little company that I just founded was asking us to come up with a natural way of engaging in nature .
it &apos;s just a glimpse of the darkness .
this little video shows what we &apos;re doing .
ah , wait a minute .
loaded video takes some time .
maybe we can skip -- I &apos;ll skip the video .
don &apos;t do it .
that &apos;s not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
isn &apos;t it , my time ?
all right , thank you very much .
a few years ago , I started a project where some of the great technologies and design people were working in a place where they called all the things they hate -- government government , a year of projects .
this project is called the American Code , which are like the <unk> of America .
we collect a few people every year and then we work for government .
it wasn &apos;t sending them to the Third World , but it was sending them to the city hall .
there , they created wonderful apps , they worked with the city companies .
but their real goal is to show the possibility that technology can create today .
this is Al .
Al was a fire hydrant in the inner city .
it looks like it &apos;s waiting for its date , but what it &apos;s really waiting for is a human being that can erase its origins because it knows when it &apos;s been covered with four feet of snow , its ability to melt down .
how does it help in a particular way ?
last year we &quot; The United States code &quot; has a team at <unk> .
they were in February at the time of February , and it was a lot of last February last year .
they noticed that the fires on the city rarely get dug up .
one of the guys in that team , Erik <unk> -- it &apos;s an epiphany on the other phenomenon : the citizens <unk> out the snow that the individual put on the fire hydrant .
so he did anything that any good programmer would do , and he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a lovely device for you to adopt a fire hydrant .
and then you agree to dig it up after snow .
if you did that , you could give it a name ; he called the first Al .
but if you don &apos;t dig it , other people can steal it from you .
so it has some little <unk> properties in it .
this is a relatively small program .
it might be the smallest act of a team that wrote that year .
but it did anything other government technology couldn &apos;t do .
it &apos;s almost like a virus .
a I.T. department at Honolulu , Hawaii , came to work in Honolulu , and realized that it wasn &apos;t necessarily about using it to be able to <unk> the snow , it could use it to pump the citizen alarm bells .
the tsunami &apos;s function is important , but often people steal the batteries inside .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check them .
and Seattle then decided to use it to get citizens to clean up the sewer channels .
Chicago just started using it to get people out of the mountains .
we now know there are nine cities that are being used .
it just drops , organic , naturally , spread out .
if you know something about government , you know , it &apos;s not universal .
developing a software is going to take a few years .
last year we had a team of three and a half months of complete a project .
it can help parents decide which public schools are best for their children .
and then we were told , if this project went in normal channels , it would take at least two years , and it would take about two million dollars .
and this is just a small number .
California &apos;s a project that costs 20 billion dollars a year , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and every class of government has projects like this .
so a program that just takes a few days to program , and is like a virus @-@ assembled program , for the government institution as a new payoff .
it sees that government can be more efficient -- but not more like private companies , like many people think .
it doesn &apos;t even look like a tech company , but it &apos;s more like the Web itself .
it means you don &apos;t approve of them , it &apos;s open .
and that &apos;s very important .
but what this project represents , more importantly , is the next generation of people taking government problems as a group of issues , asking for solutions , not a rigid institution .
and that &apos;s great information , because , as it turns out , we &apos;re pretty good at the community of digital technologies .
there &apos;s a very large community now built to make things more efficient .
it &apos;s not just the &quot; American Code , &quot; hundreds of thousands of people in the country write @-@ up daily code and code their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up government .
they were so disappointed , but they weren &apos;t complaining , and they were trying to improve it .
these people know something we &apos;ve lost .
and that &apos;s when you peel away all of our anger &apos;s shell , as we feel about politics , and a government line outside of the vehicle , and in the center of it , as Tim <unk> said , &quot; The government can do something for us . &quot;
there are a lot of people who are totally <unk> about government .
if you &apos;re one of them , I want you to think about it , because a lot of things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change , but governments are changing .
and because of the power of government , from the very fundamental source of energy comes from our people , how we see it will affect its change .
when I started this project , I didn &apos;t know much about government .
like a lot of people , I thought the government was just the election guys going into the lobby .
two years later , I had a message . government , particularly local government , is about security .
here &apos;s the phone center for service and information information recall .
if you &apos;re called the <unk> in your city , you &apos;re going to be connected here .
if there &apos;s a chance for you to work at your city center of the city center of the city center , like the colleague of our project -- in fact , they all need to do this service -- you &apos;ll see that people call the government for a very different question , including a family consultant , including having a home .
Scott got this call .
he put the word &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official code .
nothing . he begins with the animal control center .
and finally , he said , &quot; Well , you can open your door open and open up the door , and then it &apos;s loud , and see if it &apos;s going to leave ? &quot;
and that works . Scott , Scott <unk> .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the story .
and there &apos;s no waiting room number left .
it has a program , a website and a mobile app called civic connectivity .
we didn &apos;t write that program .
it &apos;s a group of brilliant people writing about new urban structures in <unk> .
there was a day when the release of the day -- this is a real report -- &quot; There &apos;s a trash bin that can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how am I going to <unk> it ? &quot;
citizens are interconnected in different ways .
Scott &apos;s conversations were human .
but it &apos;s all freely accessible to citizens , so everyone can see .
this time , a neighbor saw it .
the next report we got was this : &quot; I passed the site and found the trash behind the house .
<unk> ? see it . it &apos;s alive .
put the trash upside down and walk home .
just get out of the table . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
so that &apos;s good . that &apos;s the reality mixed with digital world .
and this is also a great example of the government putting an <unk> game .
but this is also an example of a great example of government , government , for example .
and I &apos;m not here to suggest the definition of a platform @-@ based technology .
I just wanted to mention a platform that lets people help each other .
a citizen helped another citizen , and the government plays an important role .
it just <unk> two strands .
it can be used by government services to help the people that need them , but a neighbor is far more simple than simple and simple and affordable .
and as a neighbor helped another time , our social connection is increasing .
we call the <unk> control center , and we pay a lot of money .
one of the things that we need to think about is that government is different from politics .
a lot of people understand this , but they still think that politics is the input of government .
our input from the government system is through the votes .
so far , how many political leaders have been chosen , and sometimes we spend a lot of energy trying to support a new political leader -- and then we want government to do something that reflects our values and what we need , but not much change at the end ?
that &apos;s because governments are like a huge ocean , and politics is just the top layer of the top .
the bottom is what we call the <unk> .
we talked about that word in such a way .
but it was this desire that stayed in the same way that we have and pay for what we &apos;re paying for , that we are losing our own energy .
people seem to think that politics is sexy .
if we want this department to serve us , we have to make it sexy .
because the real government is there .
we have to participate in government .
and that &apos;s exactly what the American Board of <unk> did .
have you ever met these people ?
they were an incredibly geeky group of citizens who wrote a very detailed , half @-@ page paper to respond to the U.S. <unk> &apos;s demands for financial change .
it &apos;s not about engagement , it &apos;s about engagement .
now , for those of us who have given up government , it &apos;s time to ask ourselves what kind of world we want to leave our children .
you have to realize that they have to face a huge challenge .
did we really think we could achieve the goal before we didn &apos;t improve it ?
we can &apos;t have government . we need it to be more efficient .
the good news is that it &apos;s called technology to become possible to redefine government &apos;s function in its nature and to build our citizens .
now the generation is growing up in the Web , and they know that it &apos;s not too hard to do at the same time , just to build systems .
the average age of our staff was 28 years old , so I was pretty miserable , almost more than most of them .
this generation has become used to the past .
they don &apos;t need to go through our generation to whom we have free speech ; they all have free speech .
they can express their opinion through any channel at any given time , and they do .
so when they faced a flaw in government , they didn &apos;t care about using their own voice .
they use their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write and write programs that make government work better .
and these programs allow us to optimize our society with our hands .
it could have been designed for a fire fire hydrant , or a trash could put in the trash .
of course , a lot of people were already starting to excavate the fire hydrant .
but these programs are like a small alarm clock , and you can remind us that we &apos;re not just consumers ; we &apos;re not just the consumers of government spending ; we &apos;re not just paying attention to raising taxes .
we &apos;re not just that , we &apos;re citizens .
before we improve government , we have to take responsibility as citizens .
so here &apos;s the question I leave you with : when we &apos;re dealing with a big , important thing , and it &apos;s important that we all need to do something together , we &apos;re just going to have a panel of the narrative , or are we going to be part of a group of people who are going to be part of the team who are going to be <unk> ?
thank you .
because I always tell people how wonderful this new technology is going to come , and I think that since I &apos;m with the people that I &apos;ve been with , let me suggest that my real idea and trying to look back and understand how this is happening , it seems to be an amazing improvement in technologies that we don &apos;t catch up with .
let me start with the first page of a very boring scientific slide .
and you can start off the slides .
this is just one randomly picked from my document .
what I want you to see is not the details , but the overall form of it .
this is a slide that we did about the <unk> <unk> and the power of the local <unk> .
and what &apos;s interesting is that the slide that we &apos;re all familiar with , which is a semi @-@ log plot .
every layer here represents the size of performance at scale .
and on a semi @-@ log plot , it &apos;s fresh .
and that &apos;s a little bit freaky .
that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to say next .
I broke the lights .
I &apos;m going to highlight the highlights because I &apos;m going to use the ink .
why are we going to use a logarithmic curve of technology ?
well , the answer is , if I paint the regular curve , we say , this is the year , and this is the measurement that I &apos;m prepared to paint , the measurement of technology that seems a little bit silly .
it &apos;s a bit like this .
and it didn &apos;t provide any information .
now , if I do , for example , another technology , like transport , on a semi @-@ log plot , it looks like a sticker line .
but if there was something like this .
if transportation advances are as fast as the original technology , then I can live on a cab and go to Tokyo within 30 seconds .
but it didn &apos;t grow so fast .
there &apos;s no such self @-@ sustaining in the history of technology , doubling every few years .
what I want to ask now is , if you look at these exponential curves , they &apos;re not going to last forever .
things can &apos;t change so fast .
two things happen .
or it will become something like this typical S @-@ curves all the time , or something like this .
that &apos;s all possible .
now I &apos;m an optimist , so I think it &apos;s possible to be this .
if that &apos;s the case , it means that we are at the moment in time .
we seem to be on that line , in the world &apos;s transition from the past to the future .
all I have to ask , what is the future of the world ?
what is the age of this new era ?
because this change seemed to be very confusing , very confusing , when we were there .
when I was a child , the future was like 2000 , and people were talking about what was going to happen in 2000 .
now at this conference , you &apos;re talking about the future , and you can see that the future is 2000 years . &quot;
that &apos;s how much we can get there .
in other words , the future of my life is shrinking .
and I think the reason is that we all feel what &apos;s happening .
the change is happening . we all notice .
we know that for the next three , 50 years , 50 years , because everything is so different in the future that no longer makes sense .
so I &apos;m going to talk about what that means , and what kind of transformations we &apos;re going through .
and to do that , I have to introduce a whole bunch of things that are completely different from technology and computers .
because the only way I decided to understand this is to go back to the time I was delayed .
and the time I &apos;m going to look at the timeline of life on Earth .
and I think this picture makes sense if you take billions of years of steps .
so if you look back in about 25 billion years , the Earth &apos;s largest , barren rock is smaller than chemicals .
if we look at how these chemicals combine , we begin to figure out how they form .
and I think there &apos;s some theories about how life started from RNA , but I want to tell you a simple story about life , which is that at that time there was a <unk> oil flowing all over it , and there were different chemistry in it .
some of the oil droplet contains special chemistry that makes it possible for them to concentrate chemicals from outside .
the oil droplet starts to differentiate and starts to differentiate .
the most primitive of those are the ones that sort of shape the cell , the little oil droplet .
but these oil prices aren &apos;t really alive now , because each of us is a random chemical composition .
every once a split , it &apos;s not an average chemical plant .
so each oil droplet is a bit different .
in fact , the different way of oil prices are to allow them to be more integrated in the same way , to grow larger , to divide more .
so they &apos;re getting longer , they &apos;re doing more .
it &apos;s a bit like a simple chemical form of life , but the process gets interesting when these oil prices learn a skill of providing information .
and somehow , somehow , we can &apos;t understand the whole way , and these <unk> have learned the information .
they learn to document the secret of the cells into a special material called <unk> .
in other words , they came up with the evolution of this kind of evolutionary history that they could write down their genetic information so that it could be copied in this way .
and the surprising thing was that this type of record seemed to last 25 billion years because it had evolved .
we actually , our genes form exactly the same code , the same way of recording .
in fact , any organism is recorded in exactly the same alphabet and code .
in fact , one of the only things I did for the entertainment effect was that we could record this code .
I &apos;ve got 100 pairs of <unk> , and I try not to discover them at the airport security .
but what I do in this code is I take this code , and it has the criteria that we use to tag it , and then I write my business card to an oxygen bar , which is 100 to 22 times the 100 times oxygen .
so if somebody needs a million of my business card , I &apos;ve got enough money to give everyone here , even everyone around the world , right here .
if I &apos;m a proud person , I &apos;m going to put it in a viral room .
so what &apos;s next ?
recording of oxygen , which is an interesting step .
it causes cells to form -- and it &apos;s happy billions of years .
but there &apos;s another really interesting component that starts to get completely different , which is that these cells start exchanging and communicating information to form cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , that bacteria can actually trade to oxygen .
and that &apos;s why , for example , an evolutionary <unk> .
some bacteria know how to stay out of penicillin , and it creates this oxygen that goes away and is ubiquitous in other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacterial immune to penicillin , because the bacteria are communicating information .
so these communication communities form , in a sense , they &apos;re on the same boat ; they &apos;re collaborative .
so they survive or die together , which means that if a community is successful , all the individuals in the community can replicate more , evolution is much more helpful .
so the transformation came from these communities , and as they were very close to each other , they actually gathered together and decided to write the elements of the entire population in Venice .
the next interesting stage in life is going to take billions of years .
in this period of time , there are many cells , many different types of cells , as organisms working together .
in fact , that &apos;s how many cells are .
we have a lot of cells , and they &apos;re no longer just surviving themselves .
the skin cells are not useless , if you don &apos;t have a heart cell , the muscle cells , the brain cells and so on .
so these groups are starting to evolve , and the interesting evolution of evolution is no longer just single cells , but we call it the organism .
and that &apos;s what happens in these communities .
these cells , once again , start extract information .
they &apos;re starting to build very special structures about the communities of information .
these are the neurological structures .
so neurons are the information processing tools that these cells create .
in fact , communities begin to appear experts and special structures to document , to understand information .
this is the brain and the nervous system of these cells .
this gives them the evolution of <unk> .
because then , for each individual -- learning can happen in a single organism , not a whole arc of time .
so an organism can , for example , learn to eat some kind of fruit , because it &apos;s not tasty and it &apos;s disgusting the last time it eats it .
this could happen in a single organism &apos;s life , and then just a few tens of thousands of years before this particular information processing structure was built , and it had to evolve thousands of years to learn , through the individuals eating this fruit .
so the nervous system , of course , is creating this special structure that has accelerated evolution .
because that &apos;s where evolution can happen in individuals .
it can happen over time .
but what happened next was every individual discovered , of course , the secret of communication .
the most sophisticated version we know , for example , is human language .
think about it . it &apos;s a wonderful invention .
I had a complex , chaotic , chaotic thought .
I &apos;m sitting here , basically talking , hoping to create a sort of chaotic chaos in your mind , a little bit like that .
but we &apos;re transforming complex things into sound , string of sound , and creating complex things in your brain .
so now that &apos;s driving us to work as a single organism .
so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , human beings , started <unk> out .
we &apos;re at the same stage as multi @-@ cell organisms -- extract our records , showing us the way information processes .
for example , the invention of language is a very small step in the direction .
phone , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on , are the special mechanisms that we &apos;re creating in our society for dealing with information .
all of this is connecting us , changing faster than we were before , faster , more capable of evolution .
so now evolution can happen on a delicate time scale .
you &apos;ve seen little examples of evolution that happened in front of your eyes .
so now we &apos;re going to accelerate time .
the first step I &apos;ve told you about is billions of years .
next step , like nervous and brain , takes millions of years .
next , like language and so forth , it takes less than a million years .
the next step , like the electronics , is like a matter of decades .
the process is self @-@ sufficient self @-@ sufficient , and it becomes , I guess , should self @-@ invent -- as things accelerate faster .
the faster the change , the faster it changed .
and I think that &apos;s the kind of explosion that we see here .
we see the process giving back to ourselves .
my job right now is to design computers , and I know that the mechanisms to design computers can &apos;t exist if there &apos;s no latest advances in computers .
now , what I do now is design complexity to objects that are not designed in the conventional wisdom .
I don &apos;t know the role of <unk> in the machine .
billions of dollars .
in fact , the designers that I &apos;ve been working on are designers , and we think that as sort of the kind of information , and then passing it to machines that are beyond what we can do , and much faster than what we &apos;ve been doing .
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s methods that we don &apos;t understand very well .
and one of the interesting things that I &apos;ve been using recently is evolution itself .
and what we did was we put in the machine a evolutionary process , which happens in a subtle amount of time .
for example , most extreme conditions , we can actually begin to evolve a program from random instructions .
say , &quot; computer , please generate a billion random instructions .
now let &apos;s run all of these random instructions , run all of these programs and pick the ones that I want most . &quot;
in other words , I define what I want .
suppose I need categories of data , which is a simple example I &apos;ve experimented with .
find the most close @-@ knit program .
and of course , random instructions are very impossible to separate data , so none of them can be done .
but there &apos;s one in the middle , and it &apos;s good , and it probably takes two numbers .
and I said , &quot; computer , please pick up 10 percent of the original sequence .
save these . delete the others .
now to replicate the best bits of data .
and then re @-@ <unk> them in a similar way .
take two programs to exchange them for their children , these inherited two traits for our children .
so I &apos;ve got a new generation of programmers that are doing well @-@ connected .
say , &quot; Please repeat this process . &quot;
do it again .
maybe add some mutations .
let &apos;s try and take a new generation .
each generation of programmers takes a few milliseconds .
so I &apos;ve spent a couple of minutes on computers doing the same thing as the evolution of millions of years on a computer , or in a matter of hours .
and at the end of the day , I got programs that were absolutely <unk> .
and in fact , these programs are much more efficient than any kind of programming I have .
now , if I read these programs , I don &apos;t tell you how they work .
I tried to read and explain how they work .
they &apos;re abstract , strange .
but they can do the task .
in fact , I know , I &apos;m confident that they can do the task , because they come from tens of thousands of programmers on a row .
in fact , their life is their work .
I once sat with a 747 with <unk> , and he pulled out a single card and said , &quot; Look , look at this .
and it says , &quot; Ben , there &apos;s a lot of complex parts for you to fly safety . &quot; is that what makes you confident ? &quot;
in fact , we know that engineering complexity doesn &apos;t really work very well .
so we &apos;re beginning to rely on computers to do a very different process .
it allows us to produce more complex things than normal projects .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand it yet .
in a sense , computers are way ahead of us .
we &apos;re using these now to create faster computers so that we can run the process faster .
so it &apos;s self @-@ feedback .
and that &apos;s getting faster , and that &apos;s why I think computers seem to be pretty good .
all of these technologies give back to themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and we &apos;re just a little bit of time , and this is kind of like a single cell organism that is now becoming multi @-@ cell organisms .
we &apos;re like the amoeba <unk> . there &apos;s something we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re at the turning point .
but I think there must be something with us .
I think it &apos;s a great worship of us , and it &apos;s the ultimate product of evolution .
I think all of us are part of a <unk> , no matter what next .
it &apos;s going to happen , and I haven &apos;t been selected , and I think I &apos;m over here .
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
most of the time I was in prison , in prison , on death row .
most of the time I spent my work in low @-@ income communities working in a place of desperation , doing unknown projects .
and I &apos;ve been here at TED today , and I &apos;ve given these fascinating talks to TED that I &apos;ve given them .
and in that moment , I noticed that TED has its own place .
you can see what happens here , and it affects the world .
sometimes when things happen on the TED stage , there &apos;s a lot more to what happens , and there &apos;s a lot more to it .
and I mention this because I think self @-@ position is important .
we &apos;ve already heard some wonderful talks .
we &apos;ve learned that as a teacher , your name has influence , and if you &apos;re a fairly charitable teacher , your teaching is quite exceptional .
as a doctor , you can help people , if you &apos;re a doctor of <unk> , you can help more .
so I want to talk about the importance of place .
I don &apos;t learn from being a lawyer or doing other projects of self @-@ awareness .
I actually learned it from my grandmother .
my family was a traditional black family , and there was only one <unk> of my grandmother .
she was tough . she was tough .
she has an influence in her house .
but a lot of things happened to her .
her parents had been the real <unk> .
in the &apos; 40s , &apos; 40s , her parents were <unk> .
my grandmother was born in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , and her parents decided to see the world .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also very strong .
when I was a boy , every time I saw her , she hugged me .
she &apos;s holding that tight , and I &apos;ll come back and she will let me go .
one or two hours later , when I got my goodbye , she would come and ask me , &quot; Can I feel my hug ? &quot;
and if I say , &quot; I can &apos;t feel anything , she &apos;ll come back , until I say , &quot; Yeah , she let me give it back . &quot;
she was the ability to get close to her .
the only challenge was she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of 10 .
and often when I go to grandmother and grandmother , it &apos;s hard for her to notice me , it &apos;s time .
my grandchildren are everywhere .
and I remember , one morning I woke up in the morning and ran all of the living rooms .
my grandmother sat on the other side of the room and looked at me .
at first I thought we were playing games .
I went back and I smiled , but my grandmother was serious .
she stood up about 15 minutes after she stood up , and she walked across the room and her hands said , &quot; Come , Brian , we have to talk about it . &quot;
it &apos;s like it happened yesterday .
I was always alone .
and she took me aside and she said , &quot; I want to talk to you about something , you don &apos;t want to tell anybody . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK , my grandmother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; <unk> &apos;t say anything . &quot; and I said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we sat down , and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to see me for a while . &quot;
and she said , &quot; You &apos;re a special child . &quot;
and she said , &quot; I &apos;m sure you can do anything . &quot;
I &apos;ll never forget that .
and she said , &quot; I want you to give me three things . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK , my grandmother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; number one , I want you to ensure that you will always love your mother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; Your mother is my <unk> , and you have to promise you will always love her . &quot;
I love my mom , and I said , &quot; OK , my grandmother , I will . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; The second thing is that you have to agree to me that you &apos;re going to always walk in , even if it &apos;s hard to choose . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; OK , my grandmother , I will . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; third thing , I want you to keep breathing . &quot;
I was nine years old , and I said , &quot; OK , my grandmother , I promise . &quot;
I grew up in the countryside in the south , and I had a brother and I was one @-@ year @-@ olds and a little sister , my first @-@ year @-@ olds .
and one day my brother and I came back to the <unk> beer -- I don &apos;t know how he got -- he took me and my sister and he went to the trees .
and he went mad .
he drank a beer and handed my sister , and she drank it , and they gave me a drink of beer .
and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t want it . you drink . I don &apos;t drink . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; Oh yeah , we &apos;re all drinking it here today , and we &apos;re drinking it all the time .
I drank a little bit , and my sister drank a little bit , and you were crying . &quot;
and I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want to drink . you drink you . &quot;
my brother was drawn to me .
ask , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? drink a little bit . &quot;
and then he looked at me for a moment , and he said , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re not thinking about my grandmother &apos;s going to make you promise . &quot;
and I said , &quot; What are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; <unk> and every <unk> said he was special . &quot;
I &apos;m sad .
now I want to make a confession to you .
maybe not be here .
because it &apos;s going to be everywhere .
I took a drink this year , and I want to admit to you that I never had a drop of drinks .
it wasn &apos;t for me , it wasn &apos;t about the power of defining self @-@ awareness .
when we decided the right place , we could get the world to accept things they couldn &apos;t imagine .
we can make the world do what they couldn &apos;t do .
and when I came to my grandmother , she was , of course , felt that each woman was special .
my great grandfather was banned in prison .
I wasn &apos;t just one uncle who was dying of alcohol and drunk disease .
all of these principles are my grandmother &apos;s belief that we should be .
what I want to talk to you about is our criminal law system .
and it changed a lot in 40 years .
in 1972 , only 300,000 people in prison .
today , there &apos;s <unk> .
today America is the highest proportion of the population per person in the world .
we have seven million people , seven million people , six and a half million people .
and it seemed to me that a lot of these lawsuits changed our world .
in poor communities , in color communities , there &apos;s despair , and despair is made of these changes .
a third of all black men between 18 and 30 percent of black men are not in jail , it &apos;s in <unk> or <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country -- L.A. , Baltimore , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of young people who are not in jail , in prison , in <unk> , in the early days of life .
our judicial system , not only changed , but <unk> around race , has <unk> around poverty .
the justice system in this country will respond to you if you &apos;re a convicted person and not an innocent person .
wealth , not <unk> , determines the end result .
and yet , we &apos;re pretty much here .
playing with fear and anger , the wrist convinced us that we have a lot of learning .
there was nothing left .
I was interested in this .
we see a bunch of really interesting changes in everyday work .
I &apos;m in Alabama , like many other states , that if you &apos;re sentenced to life expectancy , it &apos;s like a lifetime of your political power .
30 percent of the black men in Alabama are never allowed to vote .
we &apos;re going to take a decade forward , and this is going to take away the same percentage of political rights and vote as it was before .
but no one gets half of the word .
I represent children .
many of my <unk> were young .
the United States is the only country in the world that can imprisoned for 13 years .
I was imprisonment for the entire life of the children for the entire life of the children .
we &apos;re actually just helping these people appeal .
the world is full of products .
I was also a death row .
death penalty was alarming .
and what we learn from specific sources is that the problem is that people are guilty of their own commit .
it &apos;s a perfectly reasonable question .
but the problem is our self @-@ positioning .
another way to think about the problem is not that people are <unk> for crimes , but that we don &apos;t deserve to kill them .
I mean , it &apos;s just phenomenal .
death penalty in the United States is always the result .
one out of every nine people killed a death penalty was later proven to be mistaken for death .
this <unk> -- a ninth of them were completely innocent .
I have to say , it &apos;s phenomenal .
the people who learned aviation knew that if an automobile had an accident in the <unk> , we would certainly not let that man fly .
but it &apos;s not surprising that we can ignore the death penalty problems .
because that &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our own problems .
it &apos;s not our own struggle .
I have a lot of questions .
race , and we are not worthy of execution .
it &apos;s alarming . when I teach African history , I talk to students about slavery .
talk to them about terrorism , which begins with a great recovery , which has been on the end of World War II .
we didn &apos;t really understand that history .
but for the black people in this country , it was an era of <unk> .
in a lot of community , people were scared of it all the time .
people were worried that they were going to be attacked by bombs .
it changed their life .
and people were older now , and they said to me , &quot; Mr. <unk> , you &apos;ve got to tell you , forget about September 11th , the first time we &apos;ve ever had terrorism in America . &quot;
and they made me say , &quot; We grew up in horror . &quot;
the age of terrorism , of course , ended up becoming the <unk> gap , for decades , racism and apartheid .
however , our country doesn &apos;t like to talk about problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about history .
and that &apos;s why we can &apos;t really understand what we &apos;ve done .
we are constantly creating conflict .
we create intense atmosphere .
we can &apos;t talk about race , and I believe it &apos;s because we don &apos;t want to face a series of facts , we don &apos;t want to survive .
in South Africa , people know that we can &apos;t forget that apartheid unless we &apos;re honest with it , we settled out .
in Rwanda , even after the genocide , people have faced it , but we don &apos;t want to .
I also talked about death penalty issues in Germany .
and as a result , it &apos;s a wonderful thing , because there &apos;s an academic standing up and saying , &quot; You know , it &apos;s dreadful . &quot;
and she said , &quot; We didn &apos;t have death in Germany .
of course , our Germany will never have a death penalty . &quot;
and the whole woman said , &quot; Because of our history , we will never decide to be killed .
a <unk> and <unk> execution , a death penalty , for us , is a sense of conscience .
and I thought about this question .
what would I feel if I was looking at the German <unk> all day ?
I couldn &apos;t believe that .
that &apos;s pretty ridiculous .
but in our country , in the South states , we &apos;re really killing -- when the victim is white , not black , the possibility of death row is 10 times as much as you were convicted of black people than white people you were executed -- the possibility of death row is 21 times greater during those states , and <unk> people everywhere .
but we haven &apos;t heard yet .
I believe this suggests that we have a place crisis .
and when we &apos;re really good at these kinds of intractable problems , we are still good for those positive things that we haven &apos;t seen before .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love to create .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , all of these good things were suffering from suffering , <unk> human rights , <unk> human rights .
for me , the two are necessary .
because ultimately what we &apos;re talking about is how we want to be more secure , more contribute to the challenges of life in this complex society .
for me , it takes time to think and talk about the income of the poor , the vulnerable , the ones that never came to TED .
but they &apos;re actually sort of <unk> them into our lives .
you know , ultimately , we have to believe things that aren &apos;t seen .
we have to . we have to be smart , smart society .
innovation , innovation , innovation , is not just abstract in our mind .
they come from the ingenuity and the belief that we have in our mind .
in one hand , I believe that it &apos;s going to drive us not just for the light , but for the dark and thorny things that are also the same for the dark and ill .
it &apos;s a brilliant leader that was talking about it .
and he said , &quot; When we solve the problems of force in Eastern Europe , we want to do a lot , but most importantly , we want a hopes for a spiritual towards a sense of despair and the willingness of our collective consciousness . &quot;
the point of the heart of the mind is that my core beliefs about our TED society are also involved .
there &apos;s no need for anything to bring technology and perfect design and close to our human nature , as long as we can see suffering , towards poverty , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and I want to remind you that the position like this is a very challenging place than people who haven &apos;t seen it .
it affects you .
when I was a young lawyer , I was lucky to see Miss <unk> .
<unk> <unk> once every once in a while , meeting with two good friends , two old women <unk> , Carl Sagan , who was the lobby of the bus against the <unk> movement -- very brilliant black woman -- and a black woman named Virginia <unk> Martin .
these women get together and talk about issues .
sometimes the <unk> would call me and say , &quot; Mrs. Penn came back , we &apos;re going to be back .
do you ever want to hear us ? &quot;
I would say , &quot; Yes , ma , I would love . &quot;
and she said , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
I would say , &quot; I want to hear it . &quot;
and then I would go , just listen .
the parties were very excited and inspiring .
one time I was there listening to her lady after a few hours later , she asked me , &quot; Brian , tell me about your equality initiative .
tell me what you &apos;re going to do . &quot;
and I started <unk> .
and I said , &quot; We want to challenge injustice .
we wanted to help the men who were convicted of <unk> <unk> .
we want to fight against prejudice and discrimination in institutional institutions .
give children a life @-@ saving system for the end .
we want to do something about death penalty institutions .
we want to reduce the population of prisons .
we also want to continue <unk> imprisonment . &quot;
I made a <unk> <unk> presentation , and when I finished , she looked at me and she said , &quot; Stop . &quot;
and she said , &quot; These things make you tired , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
and the <unk> came along , and she put her hand in my hand and she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;re brave . &quot;
and I &apos;m sure that TED needs a little more courage .
we need to find our way to confront these challenges , these suffering .
because ultimately , our whole humanity depends on every human being .
in my work .
I learned something very simple .
and I started to understand , and I started to believe that every one of us will not be defined by our worst beings .
I believe , for everyone on this planet .
if he lied , he wasn &apos;t a liar .
if he didn &apos;t belong to what he was , he was a <unk> .
even if you &apos;ve killed somebody , it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a serial killer .
because I believe that human beings have a fundamental dignity law that has to respect it .
I also believe that in many parts of our country , of course , even the opposite of the poorest of the world , not wealth .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I think , on the other side of many , many , many , many different places , is justice .
and finally , I believe that although it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s a lot of opportunities for people to be stimulated , but we &apos;re not going to be judged by technology , and we &apos;re not going to be measured by wisdom and philosophy .
ultimately , people will rate that our society is not based on how we are nice to the rich , but based on how we treat the poor people , the people that are being <unk> .
because that &apos;s exactly what we really started to understand about who we were .
I always wanted to get there . I wanted to get the story over .
I work a lot .
it &apos;s almost like everybody .
sometimes these ideas are too many , and they &apos;re not going to be very serious .
I once defended these kids a lot of money .
I went to the <unk> , and I saw my <unk> , and they were , as adults .
and I started thinking , what happened ?
a judge , how can one determine a different person ?
the judge says he &apos;s adults , but I only see one child .
and one night I woke up , and I wasn &apos;t alone , and I was like , oh my God , if the judge could write you another person , the judge must have magic .
yeah , Brian , the judge has the magic .
you &apos;re free .
because I was too late to sleep , my brain didn &apos;t understand that I started a bills .
I had a sophomore , and I had a black child .
and I started doing his mantra , which is , &quot; The Secret Life of my 14 @-@ year @-@ old black child wants to be a four @-@ year @-@ old , white guy at the top . &quot;
and in this project , I said , &quot; <unk> , the police and the court . &quot;
the court didn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> or something like that .
the next morning I woke up and I woke up , did I do a dream , or did I really write this proposal ?
the scary thing about this is , not only did I write the court .
and a few months passed , and forgot exactly what happened .
and finally , I decided , oh my gosh , I have to do this .
I jumped in and felt nervous -- very nervous .
I was in the van .
and I &apos;m thinking , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , it &apos;s going to be painful .
and finally I got out of the car , and I got to the court .
and as I stood on my steps , there was a black box of black <unk> , court .
and he saw me running , and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; I &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; and he said , &quot; You , you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; and I said , &quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
and the <unk> came to me as a hug .
he whispered his ear in my ear .
he said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and I &apos;ve got to admit to you , this gives me a little bit of traction .
his words reminded me of my deep self @-@ transcendence , and it reminds me that everyone deserves a better future for society .
so I went to court .
I walked in , and I saw the judge , and I said , &quot; I &apos;ll just go in . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Ma &apos;am , have you written this ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , sir . I wrote . &quot; we started arguing .
people came in , because everybody was upset .
I did write a lot of cool stuff .
the police came in as an assistant , and the police came in .
and I hadn &apos;t turned around , and the whole court room was full of outrage , because we &apos;re talking about race , we &apos;re talking about poverty , we &apos;re talking about poverty .
and I was walking around the corner of the shed .
he &apos;s constantly asleep , and he can hear people complain .
and he walked like this .
and finally , this black man came in , and he was worried that it was almost impossible to justify sitting behind me .
10 minutes later , the judge suggested that .
during the break , a <unk> cleaner felt the sacrifice of money .
this is a <unk> jump , and it <unk> to the <unk> .
&quot; Jimmy , what are you doing in the court ? &quot;
this old black guy stood up and looked at this <unk> , and he said , &quot; I come in and I want to tell this young man to go ahead and see it better . &quot;
and I &apos;m here today at TED because I believe a lot of people here understand that the moral <unk> of the world , although it &apos;s a long , it <unk> towards just a certain <unk> .
before we start to care about human rights and dignity , we can &apos;t really accomplish evolution .
our survival and the survival of everyone .
the future of the technologies and the design that we see in the eyes of entertainment and creativity has to be associated with human nature , philanthropic , and a set of specs .
and the most important thing is for everybody obsessed , I just want to tell you , go ahead and see it better .
thank you .
you should hear the audience , the community wants to help you , the willingness to make a contribution .
what can we do with that check ?
Brian : there &apos;s a lot of opportunities .
for example , if you &apos;re living in California this spring , there &apos;s a referendum to be a big fan to <unk> the amount of money we spent on the <unk> team .
for example , in California , we &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars in the next five years -- 100 million .
and at the same time , forty percent of the six percent of our children are not falling into the valley .
fifty percent of the <unk> went through it .
this was an opportunity to change .
this was a poll that was asked to spend all this money on law enforcement and security guards .
and I think that &apos;s the opportunity we can help .
Chris : there &apos;s a big drop in the United States over 30 years .
some people say partly because of a tremendous increase in incarceration .
what would you say about that ?
Brian : almost nothing changed .
the rate of incarceration in this country is not in a form of violence .
it was the abuse of drugs .
that &apos;s the main reason why our prison population is rising .
we were a little too far too far behind <unk> .
and at the same time , we had three <unk> of the <unk> , which is , you know , <unk> some people permanent because they stole a bicycle , or a little bit of <unk> , and we didn &apos;t give them the opportunity to give them a shot of the victim .
I believe that we need to give more assistance to people than just deprive them .
I think there &apos;s no philosophy right now for anybody .
and I think it should change .
Brian , you &apos;ve made an inventory here .
you &apos;re really inspirational guys .
thank you very much for coming to TED . thank you .
number three : after Bin Laden was struck , the number of violent threats had exploded .
encounter two : Somalia appear in Somalia . <unk> 3 : the police use pepper spray .
forty @-@ four : a quarter of a ride . forty @-@ five : a cruise ship .
6 : <unk> <unk> . <unk> : 65 people died .
<unk> eight : a tsunami warning . <unk> 9 : cyberattacks .
a section of the <unk> : drug wars , mass destruction , hurricane , droughts .
there was a recession , a crisis , a crisis , a crisis , an Egyptian , Syria .
crisis , death , disasters .
Oh my God !
Peter <unk> : this is some of the video I &apos;ve collected in the last six months , and if it &apos;s six days , or in the last six years , it can be easily collected .
the point is that the news is that media tend to teach us negative information , because our brains are particularly good at it .
and of course , the brain does that for a reason .
all the time , our sensors &quot; collect a lot of information , so much of our brains don &apos;t process .
and none of that information is more important than living information , and the first line of information is a very primitive component called the brain .
the brain <unk> was our early early warning , dangerous Geiger .
it <unk> all of the information and examine it , any threat in the environment .
so whenever we open the paper , we &apos;re not automatically reading all the negative information .
and the old saying about the newspaper over the past was , &quot; <unk> the headline . &quot; it was a lot of truth .
and now we have all kinds of digital devices , all the time , all the time , all the time , all the time , all the way to be pessimistic .
no wonder people think the world is backwards .
but it may be true .
not that way , the information that we receive was <unk> .
our society has tremendous improvement in the impact of a number of events in the centuries , and in fact , that speed has enabled us to create a rich world in the next three decades .
I don &apos;t mean these problems aren &apos;t -- climate crisis , species extinctions , water and energy shortage are exactly what happens .
as humans , we &apos;re pretty good at making all kinds of predictions about the crisis , but eventually we &apos;ll get rid of them .
let &apos;s take a look at what happened in the last century , and see where we &apos;re going .
over the last hundred years , life expectancy has increased two times more than two times as much as human life expectancy , inflation has measured , and income per person around the world has tripled .
babies are dying by 10 times .
food , electricity , transportation , communication costs down 10 to 1,000 times as much as the cost of communication .
Steve <unk> pointed out that we are living in the most peaceful history of mankind .
and Charles <unk> said that the world &apos;s corrections went from 25 percent up to 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we really live in a great time .
and a lot of people forget that .
we kept expecting higher expectations .
in fact , we &apos;ve changed the concept of poverty .
if you think about it , most people in the United States today live under poverty still have electricity , drinking water , toilets , televisions , action calls , air conditioning and automobiles .
the richest <unk> <unk> of the century , the <unk> <unk> on the planet , can never imagine a luxury of that luxury .
and the basis of this is technology . and the technology of recent exponential growth .
my good friend Ray Van <unk> showed the tools of any given information technology that are following the curve , the Moore &apos;s Law and doubled every 12 to 24 months of price performance .
and that &apos;s why your mobile phone calls were 10,000 times cheaper than the size of the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s worth 1,000 times .
look at the curve .
this is Moore &apos;s Law that &apos;s been in the last hundred years .
and I want you to notice two things about the curves .
first of all , it &apos;s very smooth -- whether it &apos;s good enough for the time , whether it &apos;s war or peace , recession or growth .
it &apos;s because faster computers are used to create ever faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow down because of the enormous challenges we face .
even on the left side of the logarithmic curve , it &apos;s still upward .
technology accelerated pace itself .
on this Moore &apos;s Law curve , it &apos;s a series of powerful technologies that are open to everybody .
cloud computing , a friend of mine in Autodesk called an infinite amount of computing ; sensors and networks ; 3D printing , allows us to get the capacity of mass and deploy all over the world ; synthetic life ; bringing new fuels , vaccines and food ; digital medicine ; <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many people in the audience saw the IBM Watson and the Macintosh won ?
that was great .
I looked at newspaper news headlines , and I found the best .
and I like this : &quot; Watson <unk> the human race . &quot;
and it &apos;s not an easy match .
the key ingredient is to understand the subtle details of the human language .
and you can imagine the kind of artificial intelligence where all the people who have action calls can be used .
four years ago at TED , Ray <unk> and I founded a new university called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
we teach students all sorts of technologies , especially how to use these technologies to solve the enormous challenges facing humanity .
every year we ask students to create a company or make a product or a service to create a positive impact on a billion people &apos;s lives .
imagine a group of students could affect a billion people &apos;s lives today .
it sounds ridiculous 30 years ago .
today we can list the companies that have made it .
and when I think about creating a rich society , it &apos;s not about creating a luxury for everyone on Earth ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
it was the resources that were once scarce .
technology is relative , and technology is an instrument of liberation .
let me give you an example .
this is a story of Napoleon &apos;s Cross at the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the one on the left .
I invited <unk> for dinner .
all the Napoleon &apos;s soldiers were using gold plates , and Napoleon himself was using gold plates .
but Thai kings use aluminum <unk> .
aluminum used to be the most plastic metals in the world , much more expensive than gold and gold .
that &apos;s why the top of the <unk> is aluminum .
even though aluminum is a <unk> of the Earth , it &apos;s not a form of metal .
it &apos;s all in relation to oxygen or oxygen .
but then there was another set of techniques that made the shipping price so low that we could have a disposable store .
let &apos;s apply that to other things .
let &apos;s think about energy shortage .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on this planet as 5,000 times as much energy as we were in the average of our years .
every 88 minute has 16 terawatt energy sources of energy on the surface of the Earth .
the problem isn &apos;t energy ; it &apos;s accessible .
there &apos;s a couple of good news .
this year , for the first time in India , the cost of solar energy reduced to half the cost of fossil fuels -- <unk> , 17 rupees .
last year , the cost of solar power was reduced by half .
last month , MIT published a research report showing that by 2020 , the solar cost between six and six cents per kilowatt hours in the United States is 15 cents .
if we have enough energy , we have plenty of clean water .
and here we go out into the war .
remember ? 1990 , the <unk> of the <unk> was going through Saturn , and it was going to face the Earth .
took a famous picture of what &apos;s called a name ?
&quot; dot @-@ com number . &quot;
because we live on a planet of water .
the Earth is covered with water .
yes , two percent of seawater is the iceberg , and we &apos;re fighting over half the world &apos;s water , but we still have hope .
there &apos;s a technology that &apos;s about to be applied , not the next 10 years , 20 years , now .
there &apos;s a nano technology .
this morning I was talking to a great DIY inventor of the morning , and I want to share with you -- I got his technology -- it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and some of you may have heard about it as a small fridge , a large refrigerator .
you can grow water from any water source every day -- water , pollution water , water , rice -- a thousand liters of <unk> water , a clean drinking water that &apos;s less than two cents a day .
the president of Coke &apos;s recent modern city has been tested in more than many developing countries as <unk> .
if it &apos;s successful , I &apos;m confident that it will be successful , Coke will be deployed around the world to deploy the device .
and that &apos;s the innovation that &apos;s being driven by technology .
we see this on the mobile phone .
my gosh , at the end of 2013 , the cell phones in the developing world are going to be 70 percent .
think about it . in the middle of Kenya , one of the co @-@ founders of the New South Reagan had better <unk> than he had 25 years ago .
if they visit Google with their smartphone , they &apos;ll get more knowledge and information about 15 years ago than President Clinton .
they live in a world of information and communications and abundance that nobody could ever predict .
and better than that , we spent hundreds of millions of dollars getting -- GPS , TV and medical diagnostic technologies -- and medical diagnostics -- not getting commercially available to your mobile phone calls .
the best part of this is probably medicine .
and last month I was honored to be announcing with the <unk> Foundation , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the x @-@ ray competitions .
we challenge the team around the world to combine these technologies into mobile devices , and you can talk to it , because it has artificial intelligence , and it &apos;s coughing it , or <unk> .
to win the competition , this device needs to give you a better diagnosis than a group of physicians that have been demonstrated by committee .
imagine the app for a lack of physicians , 25 percent of the disease burden of just 1.3 percent of medical researchers in developing countries .
if this device sequenced the RNA or DNA of a virus , it would call the control center of the disease , the first time it would prevent a pandemic .
and there &apos;s the power of creating richer world .
I call it the One billion people .
that white line is population .
more than seven billion people on Earth lately .
by the way , the best way to prevent an explosion of population is to get more education in the world .
in 2010 , we had nearly two billion people and connections to the Internet .
by 2020 , the Internet will grow from two billion to five billion dollars .
three billion people have never been noticed , are going to participate in this global conversation .
what do they want ?
what will they consume ? what will their wish be ?
what we &apos;re going to happen is the largest , the growth of economic energy , not the recession .
these are the people who represent hundreds of billion dollars of dollars in the world &apos;s economy .
they &apos;re going to be more productive because they use an addition of a mobile device , and because watch the <unk> get smarter and become more productive than they &apos;ve ever been in the past three @-@ dimensional printing and infinite computing .
what are the three billion healthy , educated , productive human social members that can bring us ?
a series of discoveries we never had before .
and given permission or other difficult people have the opportunity to care for the first time .
what &apos;s the combination of 30 ?
maybe it &apos;s something we haven &apos;t seen yet ?
and one of the things that I &apos;ve learned in the course of winning X @-@ ray is the importance of goals , the passionate team of small team that can accomplish remarkable things in the past , only business and government .
let me share a story as the end of the story , and the story is so exciting .
some of you may have heard about this project .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it came from the University of Washington in Seattle .
it &apos;s a DNA sequence that allows individual people to take an amino acids and analyze how the proteins are folded .
and the way it folds determine the structure and function of the amino acids .
it &apos;s a very important medical research .
and it wasn &apos;t until now , it was a problem solved by super @-@ computer .
it was originally a game to play university .
and then hundreds and hundreds of people will play the game .
it also shows that the pattern of human recognition is still better than the best computers .
when you synthesize the best protein folding experts , it &apos;s not a professor at MIT , it &apos;s not a student at Caltech , it &apos;s a British woman from Manchester , who came to work during a healing treatment during the day , and at night it &apos;s the best proteins in the world .
ladies and gentlemen gave me a tremendous faith in the future , each of us as individuals has been challenged by the challenges of the world .
we have technology and tools to grow fast .
it &apos;s a passion for DIY inventors .
everybody has the power to be a technical -- philanthropists .
and there &apos;s 30 million people coming online and working with us a huge challenge , doing what we have to do .
we &apos;re about to be brilliant for decades .
thank you .
and I think in medicine today , there &apos;s a cultural section of culture that has to start changing .
and this change can start with a doctor , which is me .
maybe it &apos;s because I &apos;ve been practicing for many years , and I can give up some , sort of , a little bit of it and begin to change this .
before we enter the theme , let &apos;s talk about baseball .
why not ?
the traditional baseball game is over , and the world &apos;s professions are about to start .
we all love baseball , right ?
there are hundreds of thousands of these baseball worlds .
let &apos;s take data from the data .
the movie &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is about data , and how to build a great team based on the data .
I want to talk about a data that I want you all heard about .
it &apos;s called a bat rate .
when we say a ball hits the ball , it &apos;s when it &apos;s finished .
we &apos;re talking about the players getting very stable , and every 10 times you get three games .
and it means that <unk> are hit and put into the garbage cans , and it &apos;s not going to get shot immediately , and the ball isn &apos;t going to be successful until the <unk> got <unk> .
ten times three <unk> .
do you know what the Little League general <unk> review of these players ?
great , great , stars play great .
you know how they called a bat number 40 percent .
is it the four little players that hit every 10 times ?
it &apos;s a legacy -- like TED Williams -- he &apos;s the last baseball players in baseball -- and there &apos;s over 40 percent of a bat in <unk> .
now let &apos;s go back to my world -- medical field , which I &apos;m familiar with , but what I &apos;m going to talk about is something that bothers me .
suppose you had a <unk> , and then you were recommended to give a surgeon about 40 percent of the <unk> that came out of the surgery .
it sounds strange , right ?
and if you live in a remote area , and the two coronary artery bust that you love is blocked . your <unk> recommended her to a neurologist who was <unk> on a blood vessel , which had &quot; <unk> in the first round of the bat surgery . &quot;
but wait , wait , you know ?
she did a great improvement this year , and her level was recovered .
her &quot; bat number &quot; hit the ball five .
but that &apos;s not acceptable .
and I want to ask you a question .
you think , what a medical doctor should be , or a professional doctor , a <unk> doctor or an emergency manager for an emergency hospital ?
<unk> ? very good .
in fact , no one in the medical community knows what a great surgeon or an emergency person should have .
we tell each of them , including myself , putting a career in a professional class , and they tell themselves to be perfect .
absolutely , absolutely impossible to make false diagnostics -- but we make them think about detail , about how to do that .
that &apos;s the message I got at medical school .
I was a student with an obsessive @-@ compulsive <unk> .
and in high school , there was a student once said Brian <unk> would take a blood test and review it .
and I did .
and I was out of this little <unk> in Toronto , a little <unk> in a shed outside of Toronto , and finished my studies .
I <unk> everything .
I was <unk> about every piece of muscle and <unk> of the <unk> , each of which extends from the artery system from the aorta , and all of the unseen , or the usual suspects of all the time .
I even know how to determine the various <unk> of different diagnosis .
during that time , I accumulate more and more knowledge .
my performance was great , and graduated with the grade .
when I came out of medical school , I felt like I could just guess everything -- or take a step closer -- almost everything that I &apos;d made out of medical errors would be very poor .
and I didn &apos;t make mistakes in a matter of time until I met <unk> women .
when a woman was taken to a teaching hospital in Toronto , I was working as an emergency room there .
and I was appointed in a cardiac cardiac cardiac cardiac cardiac clinic .
my job is , when the emergency staff need a expertise on the heart , they &apos;re going to be diagnosing patients in hospital .
and I was responsible for my return report later .
and when I met <unk> lady , she was pretty pink .
and when I talked to her , I heard her breath has <unk> .
and when I heard her in the stethoscope on both sides of the boat coming from the stethoscope , it was <unk> cardiac failure .
that &apos;s because of the heart failure , it &apos;s all the blood coming out , and that part of the blood comes back into the lung , and it &apos;s filled with blood , and breathing oxygen .
it &apos;s not a difficult diagnosis .
and after I made the diagnosis , I started getting her treatment .
I gave her the toaster aspirin , and gave her some medicine that could save her heart .
I gave her a little bit of <unk> , <unk> , helping her tease out the extra water in her body .
she started getting better in the next two or three hours .
and I was happy .
and here I made the first mistake : I made her home .
and in the right way , I made two errors .
and before I reported back to my family in relation to my family .
I didn &apos;t do what I was supposed to do , pick up the phone call and give him a look at the case , give him an opportunity to meet this patient .
and I knew her , so I could give her more detailed data .
maybe I have the reason for that .
maybe I don &apos;t want to be the kind of guide you all the time .
maybe a patient who can communicate with me may not need to interact with his patient .
and the second mistake I made was even more serious .
when I got her home , I ignored a little voice in my heart , and the voice was trying to tell me , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s too bad , don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , I wasn &apos;t confident at the time , and I even looked at the nurses of the woman who was looking for her and she said , &quot; Do you think she &apos;d come home ? &quot;
the nurse thought , and the nurse said , &quot; Well , I think there &apos;s no problem . &quot;
and it all seemed to me as it was yesterday .
I signed up at the hospital , an ambulance <unk> sent her home .
and then I went back to work in my clinic .
and on the next day , that afternoon , my gut had a kind of gut feeling .
but I kept working .
and after the work ended , I left the hospital behind , and as I walked into the parking lot to get the distance of my car , I did something that I couldn &apos;t normally do .
I borrowed from the emergency room .
and there was another nurse , not the other woman who took care of a woman , who told me that most physicians were afraid to hear three words .
other doctors were also frightened of these three words , but because the patient that the doctor looked at was full of money , the three words were different for us .
these three words : remember ?
&quot; remember that person you send home ? &quot;
the nurse was asking .
&quot; she came back . &quot; she used that regular tone .
she did come back .
they &apos;re coming back .
about an hour after I got her home , about an hour later , she was on the ground , and her family knocked on 9 / 11 , and the emergency woman brought her back to the emergency room . she had a big shock , half of her blood pressure .
her breathing was incredibly faint , <unk> .
the winner of an emergency hospital was exhilarating .
they gave her increased blood pressure .
and she connected her <unk> .
and I was shocked , and I was shocked .
and then I was like doing a <unk> reaction , because as they <unk> her , they put her back into the ward , and I wanted her to wake up in despair .
but in the next two or three days , she never woke up again .
her brain had been touched by an injury .
her family came together .
and in the next session , they slowly accepted it .
in <unk> , they chose to leave her life -- the wife of a family , the mother and the grandmother .
some people say you never forget the names of the dead people you have given .
and that was the first time I realized that .
and for the next couple of weeks , I was so frustrated , and I had the first time in the first time in the danger of a shame in medicine -- I felt alone . it wasn &apos;t a sense of being healthy , because you couldn &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
it &apos;s that -- when you <unk> your commitment to your best friend and you say it to be conservative , and you know later , your best friend looks for you , even though you &apos;re arguing about it , but that guilt is still leading to you , and I &apos;m not going to be the same mistake of recidivism .
and then you made a change @-@ changing commitment , and then you &apos;re constantly going to <unk> .
it &apos;s a shame that has a role to be taught .
and the kind of non @-@ virtuous shame that I &apos;m talking about is what makes you enter your brain .
it would say to you , not what you &apos;re doing wrong , but you &apos;re a bad guy .
that was my feeling at the time .
and that &apos;s not because of my <unk> ; others are wonderful .
he talked to the family a little bit about it , and I &apos;m sure he didn &apos;t hit me for sure that I hadn &apos;t been executed for sure .
but I kept asking myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t I have my voice then ? why did I get her home ?
and even more frustrating , I would ask : why did I commit such dumb errors ?
why would I choose access to medicine ?
slowly but slowly steady , that awful feeling began to melt .
and I started to feel <unk> .
and then in a sunny day , when I saw a flash of light in the sun , I thought , maybe I could feel better again .
and then I made an appointment with myself : if I was making perfect , then I was no longer wrong , and I was going to make that self @-@ sacrifice .
that voice did stop .
I went back to work .
but it happened again .
two years later , when I was in a <unk> in Toronto , a community in a neighborhood in Northern Toronto , I saw a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man who had lost his throat .
and the clinics were busy , so I was getting started .
and he points over here .
and I looked at his throat a little bit of a thousand times .
I left him a prescription for penicillin .
even as he walked out of the gate of the clinic , he seemed to point to his throat .
two days later , I was on the emergency room , and my director was going to go to her office in private .
and she said those three words : remember ?
&quot; remember ? the patient you saw on the throat ? &quot;
he didn &apos;t have any sexual <unk> at all .
it &apos;s a condition that might be threatened to be alive called <unk> .
you can look at Google , but it &apos;s not throat , it &apos;s an infection of <unk> , and it could cause respiratory failure .
luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
and after a few days of being prepared to make antibiotics , he was cured .
and I went back to that moment of guilt and regret , and then the emotional <unk> came back to work until the errors started over and over again .
in the same <unk> watch , I didn &apos;t see the patient twice .
it &apos;s hard to imagine what &apos;s going to happen , especially when you work in a hospital where you &apos;re in a hospital where you &apos;re in a night .
and although for those two cases , I didn &apos;t have them come home , and I didn &apos;t feel like there was any void and errors in the process .
one of them I diagnosed is <unk> .
and he set up the kidney X @-@ ray , but it turned out to be normal , and my colleagues were <unk> the patient &apos;s disease , and he noticed that the patient &apos;s right @-@ hand part parts of the hip @-@ hop , they connected the surgeons .
another patient has severe diarrhea .
I gave him a bunch of liquid to give him water , and to give my colleagues a peek .
he did it . and when he noticed that the patient was a bit soft and soft , he connected the surgeons .
both of these patients have done surgery and recovered .
but whenever I think of those two cases , that feeling kills me .
and I hope I can tell you that the worst mistake I &apos;ve made is only five years before I started medicine , like many of my colleagues described it as normal , but it &apos;s completely <unk> .
in the last five years , I &apos;ve made some errors .
I still felt lonely , shame , helpless .
but the crux of the problem is : if I can &apos;t explain and talk about the wrong mistakes I &apos;ve made , if I can &apos;t find the sources that tell me the wrong source , how can I share my experiences with my colleagues ?
how do I teach them that they no longer repeat my mistakes ?
and as I walked into a situation -- like right now , I had no idea how you looked at me .
the last time you heard somebody talk about what failed and what failed ?
yes , if you go to a party , you may hear something about other doctors &apos; mistakes , but you don &apos;t hear somebody talking about your mistakes .
if I walk into a room right now , and I ask them to help and start telling them what I just told you about , perhaps before I even tell you more than two stories , they begin to get uncomfortable with a joke , and then someone starts changing the topic .
in fact , if I were , or my colleagues , who knew that one of the nurses in the hospital had legs to help the patient , believe me , when I met him , I couldn &apos;t mix with him normal eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
a system that completely disappeared .
there are only two types of people in this system -- wrong mistakes , things that can cause sleep loss and <unk> , and the outcomes that have bad outcomes and good outcomes .
it &apos;s almost like the self @-@ immune response , like the antibodies normally started attacking that different person .
we have an idea that when we blow out all the mistakes we make in medicine , we get a safe system .
but it raises two questions .
in my first paper on <unk> radio and news , from the first article I wrote about in Toronto , to my show , &quot; <unk> , &quot; where I personally learned everything I can access to , all the mistakes I have access to , all the medical mistakes I have .
and what I &apos;ve learned is that mistakes are everywhere .
we work in a system where errors every day , and the hospital has a 10 percent chance to give a <unk> or give a wrong dose of errors , and in hospitals are increasingly showing increasing rates of injury and death .
in this country , there are almost 20,000 <unk> of Canada dying of medical errors that prevent .
in the United States , according to the Institute of Medicine , there were 10 classes .
even though , the same data has been a little bit underestimated in terms of reality , because we haven &apos;t looked at this problem as we should .
the point is that .
in a healthcare system that has doubled and multiplied in two to three years , we can &apos;t measure the growth of that knowledge .
sleep deprivation is absolutely universal .
and we can &apos;t get away from that .
our own intuition biases that directly affect our conclusion , for example , I could record a perfect patient record for a patient .
but if this same patient was talking about something free and breathing a little bit of alcohol , I wrote a little bit of <unk> and a bit of <unk> .
and this one turns out to be completely different .
I &apos;m not a robot . I don &apos;t do the same thing every time .
my patient wasn &apos;t a car ; they didn &apos;t describe their symptoms every time .
so the errors are inevitable .
if the systems that I &apos;ve been taught have pretty much come out of all the <unk> medical professionals that go awry , there &apos;s no left in this area .
and it &apos;s about the worst mistakes people don &apos;t want to talk about their faces .
and in my show &quot; <unk> , &quot; which I &apos;ve said , &quot; which is my worst mistake , &quot; and I &apos;m going to ask everybody from emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency
their pupils dilate , they <unk> , they look at the ground , <unk> and they start telling me their stories .
they want to tell their stories , and they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; Look , it &apos;s as wrong as I am . &quot;
they just need a moment of silence .
what they need is a re @-@ defined medical culture .
it started with a individual doctor .
the doctors who have redefine definitions are human , understanding that she &apos;s man and acceptance the fact that she &apos;s not making a mistake , but learning from it and learning to others .
she will share her experience with other people .
and they were supportive when others were talking about their sin .
she doesn &apos;t have a sense of <unk> , but it &apos;s only a kind of serve as a kind of care that everybody can benefit from , a way of figuring out other people &apos;s errors .
and the medical culture that she worked in has acknowledged that the whole system was run by people , and when one person works in a system , sometimes an error .
and the system can evolve over and over and over again , and it can give you a lot of sense of the wrong things that we can &apos;t avoid , but at the same time , we can create a job for care , for each and every one of the people who watch our healthcare system once again suggests that some of the unexpected errors , particularly encouraging people like me to be right after the positive .
I was Brian <unk> .
I &apos;m a physician <unk> .
I &apos;m a human , and I will make mistakes .
I was sorry for that , but I would try to learn and learn from that .
I still don &apos;t know how you think about me , but I think I can take it .
and I ended up making three words out of myself : I remember .
in the 1960s in the &apos; 80s in East Germany , if you had a typewriter , you had to <unk> government .
you had to come from a copy of that <unk> .
so the government could track where the text came from .
if they find a single page of the wrong point , they can track who generated it .
and in the West we can &apos;t understand how someone can do this , it &apos;s going to be so free to free speech .
we will never do that in our own country .
but today , 2011 , today , if you buy a page from any of the big <unk> manufacturer , a page of colored paper , and then finally some small pieces of paper that appear on every page on every page on every page gives you a unique printer and your printer .
that &apos;s what happened to us today .
it seemed like no one was doing it .
this is an example of what our government uses of technology to deal with our citizens .
this is one of the three major sources of the Internet today .
and if we look at what happens online , we identify as the attacker of the United States .
we have three major groups .
we have online criminals .
here we have a gentleman named Ellen <unk> from Kiev , Ukraine .
online criminals are easy to understand .
these guys made money for money .
they make a lot of money online attacks , lots and lots of money .
we actually have several cases of <unk> made from online <unk> , all made by online attacks .
and here comes <unk> from Estonia .
this is Alfred <unk> .
this is Stephen <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> .
this is Matthew Anderson , a brass pen , etc .
these people made a lot of money online , but they made illegal money from using bank services like <unk> from our account when we were on the Internet , or using <unk> to collect our credit card information when we were getting infected computers online .
the United States , two months ago , froze Mr. <unk> &apos;s bank accounts at the Swiss bank in Switzerland , and there were <unk> million dollars in the frozen Mediterranean .
Mr. <unk> still hangs himself ; nobody knows where he is .
today I &apos;ve come to conclude that any of us here may be an online victim of crime and even beyond reality .
and it &apos;s obviously getting worse .
in the future , most crime will happen online .
the second major attack groups we &apos;re looking at today are not due to money .
and their motivation came from other places -- because of protest , and they were laughed for being ridiculed .
these anonymous groups have been active in the last 12 months and become the major participants in the online attack .
these are the key players : for the money , the anonymous attacks , the last group , the government , for the last group , were attacks .
let &apos;s take an example of what happened in the company , <unk> .
this is a typical example of government attacking it against its own citizens .
<unk> is a authority in Holland , or it used to be .
it happened last fall because they were hacked .
some people completely destroyed it .
I asked a meeting last week in a meeting with the fire department , and I asked a leading leader if he discovered somebody could have died because of an evil attack .
his answer was yes .
so how did people die for such an attack ?
<unk> is an authority certificate .
they sell certificate .
what do you do with certificate ?
you need a certificate , which is that you have a website that has four million tons of secret services , similar services .
all of us or most of us today , any one of them in the world of <unk> or one of its opponents , are services that are particularly popular in a country like Iran , Iran , the foreign services , because they know these are more reliable than local services , so the government can &apos;t talk about them .
they can too , if they attacked a foreign authority .
the <unk> certificate .
that &apos;s exactly what happened in the case of <unk> .
what happened in the Arab region , like in Egypt ?
in Egypt , the remains of the headquarters for the Egyptian government , in April of 2011 , they found a lot of documents when they came back .
in these documents , there was a paper called <unk> .
some of the notes came from a German company , and they sold a set of tools for the Egyptian government for extracting -- a lot of the communications that the government has in the world .
they sold this tool to the Egyptian government as 28 Euros .
the headquarters for the company are there .
so the Western government is providing the tools to contrast their own citizens .
but the Western government also did it for themselves .
for example , in Germany , just a few weeks ago , there was a government searching for their own citizens in Germany .
if you were a host of <unk> , it &apos;s obvious that your eye has been heard .
but today , things are gone .
they &apos;re going to watch your Internet connection .
they &apos;re going to use tools like <unk> <unk> to infect your computer so that they can monitor all of your communications , listen to your online and gather your password .
and as we go deeper into this , the reaction of people obviously sounds bad , because I &apos;m a legitimate citizen , and it doesn &apos;t really affect me .
why am I worried ?
I didn &apos;t hide anything . &quot;
that &apos;s where the argument is , there &apos;s no reason .
privacy is an authentic assessment .
privacy doesn &apos;t have to talk .
it &apos;s not a question of privacy against safety .
it &apos;s a question of free control .
we &apos;re going to trust our government in 2011 , and any power we give up is going to lose forever .
will we trust the future government , blindly trusting , a government after 50 years ?
these are the questions we have to worry about the next 50 years .
it might sound a little bit freaky , I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
the first one was made in <unk> , which was a very simple idea of putting cement in a fixed @-@ scale bricks .
fast @-@ forward to the biggest construction unit in the world .
it allows us to make things more than ourselves , buildings , bridges , and bridge over time .
the actual Lego blocks have become essentially the kind of bricks of our time .
and about 100 years later in 1947 , the Lego created this .
it was called the Self @-@ Assembly .
and in just a few years , Lego occupies every family .
it &apos;s been estimated that there &apos;s been more than 400 billion dollars built -- or 75 billion dollars per person per person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer , you can build beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
the Lego makes it possible .
the Lego essentially is to take the Lego blocks , the real world &apos;s real @-@ world Lego , and apply them to the building blocks we imagine .
it was exactly the same year , in the same decade , a new revolution is going to launch , next generation of bricks .
transistors are a small plastic component which brings us to come from static bricks to whole new worlds that can interact with .
you can use it as a transistor transistors , you can create larger , more complex circuits .
but there &apos;s a key difference : just experts playing with transistors .
I personally can &apos;t accept the only experts in our time , so I decided to change it .
eight years ago , when I was at the Media Lab , I started thinking about how you could empower the engineers and the designers and the designers .
a few years ago , I started developing <unk> .
I &apos;ll show you how it works .
<unk> are modules that have specific function each of them .
they all set in advance as light , motors , sensors .
and best of all , they &apos;re magnets , they &apos;re mixed together .
so it &apos;s impossible to assemble wrong .
the bits are separated by color .
green is output , blue is power , and pink is input , which is the orange one .
so what you need to do is get the blue on the green , and immediately you can start building bigger circuits .
you take the blue and you get a green light .
you can put a dial in the middle and you can make a little hoop .
and you take out a bunch of clicks , and you &apos;re there , and now you create a little LED .
add the pressure to add points , and you create a noise machine .
I had to buy it .
in addition to simplicity , it &apos;s actually very powerful , very powerful .
there &apos;s no programming , there &apos;s a <unk> , there &apos;s a place where you can program it with simple intuition .
so for example , if you &apos;re going to shine a little bit on the snow , you just have to turn the button and actually make it faster or slower .
the idea behind the mystery is that it &apos;s a repository of materials that grow up .
we wanted to make every single individual interaction function of the world in an available place .
light , voice , solar panels , motors -- everything should be <unk> .
we used to give our children and see them playing .
that was an incredible experience .
and the best thing is that they start to understand the electronics around them that they don &apos;t learn .
for example , how <unk> work or why the <unk> can keep on , or what the iPod feels for .
we &apos;ve also been bringing design to design schools .
for example , we used to have designers who had no experience at all with raw materials .
and as you can see , it &apos;s made out of <unk> and paper .
a few weeks ago , we took <unk> to Rhode Island School of Design to give it to some designers that have no engineering experience just to some cardboard , wood and paper -- and tell them , &quot; do something . &quot;
and this is a project they &apos;ve done , a action @-@ activated <unk> .
wait , this is actually one of my favorites .
it &apos;s a &quot; play @-@ dough &quot; play @-@ dough ; it &apos;s pretty amazing .
for these technologists , <unk> became another material , and electrons were just a material .
and we want to make this material available to everyone .
so open source is open source .
you can go to the website and download all of the design files , and make it yourself .
we want to encourage an entire world of makers , inventors and <unk> , because the world we live in , the world of interaction , belongs to each of us .
don &apos;t panic , start your invention .
thank you .
when I was 11 years old , I remember one morning , and I heard the sound of pleasure in the house .
my father was listening to the BBC with his little <unk> radio .
and he didn &apos;t see it very much , because most of the news just caused him to be depressed .
the Taliban came ! the father was screaming .
I don &apos;t know what that means , but I can see the father is very happy .
&quot; you can now go to a real school . &quot; he said .
I &apos;ll never forget that morning .
a real school .
I was six years old , the Taliban occupied Afghanistan and the girls were illegal in school .
so in the next five years , I went with my sister to a secret school where my sister was no longer allowed to go .
these are the only two of us who are taught in education .
we &apos;re going to walk different routes every day so that no one &apos;s going where we &apos;re going .
we put books in the food store , and others think we &apos;re just shopping .
the school was in a house , and we had 100 people locked in a small living room .
it &apos;s good in winter , but summer is freezing .
we all know that we &apos;re at risk of life -- teachers , students and parents understand it .
sometimes , school is closed a week because the Taliban doubt .
we &apos;re always worried about being discovered by the Taliban .
are we being tracked ?
do they know our place ?
we were scared , but we still wanted to go to school .
I was fortunate to grow up in a family that valued education and loved daughter .
my grandfather was a remarkable man in his age .
he was born in Afghanistan , and he had different perceptions of other people , and he insisted that his daughter , my mother , went to school , and had been cut off from his father .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
that &apos;s her .
she retired two years ago , and she turned my house into a school , a girl and a woman in an education community .
my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first person in his family to be educated .
so no doubt , his children should be educated , including his daughter , even the Taliban , even though there &apos;s a risk .
for him , kids are less educated than they are .
the Taliban took those years of Afghanistan in the Taliban , and I remember sometimes I was always frightened of my life , invisible to the future .
I thought I &apos;d give up , but my father would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you may lose anything in your life .
your money might be stole , and you might be <unk> from the war .
and the only thing that you can live with is this : if we have to pay the tuition fees , we will be naked .
even though you don &apos;t want to continue ? &quot;
I &apos;m 22 years old now .
I grew up in a country that had been destroyed for decades .
I was a woman of age , less than six percent of my high school students , and if not my family &apos;s commitment , I would be like most people .
and I &apos;m now a proud college student .
one of the top songs of the United States is one of the top songs of the United States , so that was number five in 2012 , when I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the daughter was kicked out of the house and presented to me first .
he was proud of not only my university education , but also because in women , I was the first person in women , and I was the first person to drive him in the streets of Kabul .
my family trusted me .
my dreams were big , but they were expecting me more or more .
and that &apos;s why I became a global ambassador , a global organization for women &apos;s education .
and that &apos;s why I got involved in a new initiative , the first , perhaps the only boarding school in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , girls were still very dangerous .
and what excites me is that I see the students in my school have the opportunity and aspirations .
I saw their parents &apos; parents , and especially their fathers , as my father stood for them , although they saw the horror of their faces .
for example , he wasn &apos;t a real names , and I couldn &apos;t let you see his looks like he was my father as a student .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter were bombed on the streets of school , and they were bombed on the roadside bombs .
and he arrived , and the phone rings , a voice warning him that if he would take his daughter to school , it would happen again .
&quot; if you think , it &apos;s going to kill me now . &quot; he said , &quot; But I &apos;m not going to destroy my daughter &apos;s future for you . &quot;
and for Afghanistan , I realized -- this is something that the West didn &apos;t realize -- that behind our success is a father -- he could recognize the value of his daughter , the success of his daughter , the success of his daughter .
it &apos;s not that mothers aren &apos;t important for our success .
in fact , for the future of daughter &apos;s daughter , they &apos;re usually the first and the most compelling <unk> , but in a society like Afghanistan , we have to have male support .
in the Taliban controlled , there were only a couple of people in school -- please don &apos;t forget , it was illegal .
but today , Afghanistan is over 300 million girls .
Afghanistan is very different from the United States .
I discovered that Americans can see the fragility of our change .
and I was worried how long these changes were going to last after the U.S. military were on .
but when I went back to Afghanistan and saw my students and my support and encouraged their parents , I saw the future of hope , and see that change will continue .
for me , Afghanistan is full of hope and infinite possibilities , and every single day the girls who read them that reminded me .
like me , they have great dreams .
thank you .
everything I did , whether it was my entire life -- was influenced by the life that I worked in Africa for the last seven years .
1971 went to 1977 . I looked young , but actually I was old in Zambia , Kenya , Kenya , Algeria , Somalia , Somalia , Somalia , a lot of partnerships with African countries .
I was working in a non @-@ governmental organization , and every project that we built in Africa failed .
I was panic .
when I was 21 years old , I think we were Italian and we were doing good for Africa .
and yet , what are we doing ?
our first project gave me the first book , and the book is called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; and in this project , the Italians decided to teach <unk> .
so , we took the seeds from Italy to the southern part of Zambia , a spectacular valley to the south , and we taught the indigenous people to grow Japanese and <unk> and so on .
and of course , the local people were not interested in this , so we paid them to come to work , and they weren &apos;t there for a moment .
and we were thrilled about this with this rich valley where the people weren &apos;t farming .
but we didn &apos;t ask them why , and just <unk> and say , &quot; Gene <unk> us . &quot;
&quot; help out in the front lines of hunger in the people of hunger . &quot;
and of course , everything in Africa looks great .
our own <unk> are beautiful . this is in Italy , a tomatoes that grows up here in Zambia , and grows in Zambia .
it &apos;s unbelievable . we said to Zambia , &quot; Look , it &apos;s easier to farm . &quot;
and as the tomatoes get up , the look @-@ alike , overnight the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> all the tomatoes .
we said to Zambia , &quot; OMG , these damn <unk> ! &quot;
and Zambia said , &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s why we &apos;re not here . &quot;
&quot; why don &apos;t you say anything ? &quot; you haven &apos;t asked it yet . &quot;
I thought it was only our Italians failing in Africa , but when I knew what Americans were , the British were , and after they did , I was very proud of our project in Zambia .
because we at least fed the <unk> .
and you should look at this garbage -- you should see how many of the people we put in Africa that trust people .
you can read this book called &quot; The <unk> aid , &quot; and the author is Tim <unk> &apos;s <unk> , an orthopedic economist .
this book was published in 2009 .
we &apos;ve spent two billion dollars invested in Africa over the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to talk to you about the damage that money has caused .
you read it yourself .
let &apos;s take a look at the way African woman thought we had a huge amount of damage .
we &apos;re Western , <unk> , <unk> , and religious missionaries , there are only two ways that we deal with people : one , two is the parent of the other .
these two words come from a Latin word , &quot; meaning &quot; father . &quot;
but two words mean different .
parents love to say that I treat people in different cultures as my child . &quot;
and what <unk> meant was that I looked at the other cultures as my servant .
that &apos;s why white people in Africa are called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is the owner .
when I read a book , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is the most important thing for economic development , he said , if people don &apos;t want to help , just go with them .
this should be the primary principle of aid .
the primary principle of aid is respect .
this morning , Mr. <unk> put a stick on the floor for this conference , and he said , &quot; Could we -- can you imagine a city that &apos;s not invaded by a new city ? &quot;
when I was 27 years old , I made a decision , only based on the need for people , and I founded a job system called corporations <unk> . we didn &apos;t do the founder , nor inspired anyone , but for local entrepreneurs to find a better place for the local people .
so what we &apos;re going to do -- just shut up .
we walked into a community and we weren &apos;t going to impose any ideas on each other , but we were sitting with the locals .
our work wasn &apos;t in the office .
we met with our customers in restaurants and bars .
we don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
what we &apos;ve done is we have friends with them , and we discover their interest and purpose .
the most important thing is passion .
you can ask your ideas to your clients .
but what if you &apos;re not interested in each other ?
the clients love the passion for self @-@ improvement is the most important .
the passion for each other is based on self @-@ improvement , which is the most important .
and then we help them collect the information and the information , because it &apos;s the world , the <unk> , the <unk> .
people with ideas don &apos;t necessarily know anything about it , but we can support it .
so many years ago , I had an idea that we couldn &apos;t have at least one of the ideas we had , not to impose our ideas on them , but that can &apos;t happen in the community meetings .
I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
there &apos;s a problem with community meetings .
the entrepreneurs never finished showing you , they &apos;re not going to spend money in public spaces , they &apos;re going to spend their money where they &apos;re going to spend their money .
so there &apos;s a proposal for the project .
you don &apos;t even have the smartest people in your community because they &apos;re not even involved in your public gathering .
and what we did was , we had to build a social infrastructure that had never been possible before .
we have to create a new career .
it &apos;s a professional equivalent to the business of entrepreneurship , the company that has to face face @-@ to @-@ face with you in your household , your kitchen kitchen dining room , or a cafe cafe , helping you out the window to transform your entrepreneurial passion for a living skills .
I did an experiment in <unk> , Iowa .
and I was a Ph.D. , trying to get rid of that <unk> of practice , and then it was only <unk> .
my first year at <unk> , which was just a walk out of the street , and in those days I had the first customer , and I helped the first person . he was a garage in a garage , and I was teaching the fish to give him the first restaurants , and the local fishermen were saying , &quot; Can you come and tell me , &quot; You know what ? &quot;
I had all these five fishermen job , not to get a nice tuna at 60 cents per square inch and sell it to the <unk> factory in the United States , but to sell it at 15 dollars a pound for Japan , and then the farmer ran to me and said , &quot; Hey , can you help them ? &quot;
within a year , I did 27 projects , and the government came and asked me , &quot; What do you do ?
how can you -- &quot; I said , &quot; I did something very difficult .
that &apos;s <unk> , listen to them . &quot;
so -- So the government said , &quot; That &apos;s it . &quot;
we started this project in 300 communities around the world .
we have helped build 40,000 companies .
the next generation of entrepreneurs suffer from nothing .
Peter Gabriel : one of the greatest <unk> of all time , a few years ago , 96 years ago .
Peter <unk> said before he went to business as a philosophical professor , Peter <unk> once said , &quot; The plan is inherently anti @-@ social and entrepreneurial economy . &quot;
the plan was to give entrepreneurship a lot of money .
now , we reconstructed New Zealand , but we don &apos;t know what the smartest and brightest and how to use their own money and their energy .
we have to learn how to give these people their opinions .
we have to give them permission , and respect their privacy , and we have to be good at providing them , so that they come to the door and they come to the door .
in a community of 100,000 people , we have 200 customers .
can you imagine how much intelligence and passion a community of over 4,000 people ?
who &apos;s the biggest talk you &apos;ve ever given ?
entrepreneurial people are full of passion . you clap them .
so what I want to say is that pioneering spirit is what &apos;s happening today .
when we were at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we were using <unk> fuel , manufacturing -- but we suddenly realized that this was sustainable .
the internal combustion engine is a day of fuel .
it &apos;s not <unk> in the refrigerated goods .
what we &apos;re going to care now is how we &apos;re going to meet the seven billion people of food , health , education , transportation and communication demand .
there &apos;s no technology at all .
who can invent this technology for a green revolution ? university ?
government ? don &apos;t you ?
entrepreneurs are the entrepreneurs who are struggling with it .
many years ago , I saw an interesting article in a journal of <unk> .
there were a group of experts invited to talk about what the future of New York was .
and that &apos;s when they were brought together in the year 1957 , and they all made a hint of New York City 100 years later : 100 years later , New York was going to disappear .
why ? because they &apos;re looking at the curves on the graph and saying , if the population continues to grow at this speed , the people in New York will need six million horses , and six million horses , the waste is going to fail .
and people will be flooded .
so they were talking about 400 years , and they thought , this kind of dirty technology would kill the life of New York .
so what happened ? 40 years later , 1900 , there was one , <unk> automobile manufacturers -- one , <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s a new technology that &apos;s just coming out of development , and that little factory that &apos;s suspended from the shelves .
the Ford Motor Company , Michigan , was the Ford Motor Company in Michigan .
however , there &apos;s a secret to entrepreneurs .
one , you have to secure their commitment .
they &apos;re not going to come to you .
and then you have to offer them a passion for commitment .
you have to tell them what entrepreneurship is .
whether it &apos;s a large company or small company , it &apos;s a good thing to do with three things : marketing has to get efficient , marketing has to be smart .
what &apos;s the problem ?
there &apos;s no one in the world that &apos;s ever made and sold and financial work at the same time .
this person doesn &apos;t exist .
people like this haven &apos;t been born yet .
we &apos;ve done a survey of 100 of the world &apos;s 100 commercial companies -- Carnegie training companies , Edison , of the Ford Motor Company , and all of these <unk> companies , <unk> , and Yahoo .
all successful businesses in the world only one thing in common : no business is created by one .
now we had 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Professor <unk> , and we started by presenting Richard Branson with the first thing we had with this other name and how many times we were using this word &quot; The elaborate &quot; by <unk> Richard Branson &quot; and how many times we use this word &quot; our &quot; and how many times we use it . &quot;
&quot; I did nothing once . &quot; we did it 32 times .
he was not alone at the beginning .
nobody can start a business alone . nobody .
so we can create a community , and in this community , we have expertise from the local backgrounds , from the cafe , and from the pub , and from the pub to the pub , where we can offer you , what are you going to ask for ?
what can you do ? can you make it ?
can you sell it out ? can you build the money ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , this one I can &apos;t . &quot; does it mean that I have some help for you ? &quot;
we inspire local communities to invest in entrepreneurs .
we have volunteers who have helped create entrepreneurial resources and human resources , and we &apos;ve discovered that local people can create miracle cultures and economies that can change communities , as long as you can take this passion , this energy , this energy .
thank you .
five years ago , I had this experience of a free time of Alice <unk> .
and the University of Pennsylvania got me to teach the teachers to communicate with the students in the <unk> .
I was frightened .
and I was really frightened . these students developed the brain , and the colors that they read , and the words that they use , the long and long , were all frightened of me .
but as the dialogue began , my experience was as beautiful as Alice was going down the rabbit hole , and seeing that <unk> across into a completely new gate of the world .
and that &apos;s how I felt when I was talking to the students , and I was amazed at their ideas , and I hope others will experience that in their <unk> .
and I believe the key to open that door is to have great conversations and communication .
in order to change the world , we really need to get a great deal of communication from our scientists and engineers .
all of our scientists and engineers solve the biggest problems that we face , from energy to the environment , to health care , and so on . if we don &apos;t understand what we don &apos;t understand , they don &apos;t mean what we do , and I believe that we have a responsibility to interact with them as scientists .
but if our scientists and engineers aren &apos;t going to pick us up and look at their <unk> , we wouldn &apos;t have a great conversation between them .
so scientists and engineers , please tell us what high @-@ tech is .
I want to share with you some useful tools to tell you how to ensure that we also think of your science &quot; sexy and yours as well .
the first question is , what about high @-@ tech ?
tell us why your science is relevant to us .
and I want to tell you a little bit about the oxygen that you &apos;re looking at , because the bone structure of the bone is important to recognize and treat .
and when you describe the science of science , you have to pay attention to jargon .
the term is that we understand a obstacle to your ideas .
and of course , you can say , &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; but why doesn &apos;t space and time ? that makes a lot of sense to us .
let your ideas be easy to understand and to simplify it .
instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , not simplify .
you don &apos;t have to change your perspective to convey your scientific theories .
you can think of using examples , stories , analogies . these are the ones that excite us , the ways that we &apos;re excited about .
and when I showed you the research , don &apos;t just use points .
have you ever thought about why some <unk> might be called bullet points ?
what &apos;s the bullet shooting ? the bullet kills you , and it shows you .
these slides are not just boring , but they &apos;re too much dependent on our language areas where we don &apos;t know what to do .
and this is an example made by Gordon Brown , which was much better . it showed us the extraordinary structure of the Eiffel Tower , even the unique design that was inspired by the Eiffel Tower .
and the trick here is to use simple , straightforward sentences to have an audience a little bit hard to understand , and then to provide some images that stimulated our senses , and give us a deeper understanding of what we &apos;re describing .
these are the key tools that I think will help us open the gate of the gate of the door of science and engineering .
and because the engineers that I worked with taught me about the academic <unk> in my heart , I wanted to sum up my ideas .
with your science , forget your point and your jargon , divided by related content , is to share and audience content , and then multiplied the passion of your work that you &apos;re working on , which is : fully understanding , phenomenal engagement , amazing engagement .
so scientists and engineers , and after you &apos;ve solved that equation , everything is done , tell me about high @-@ tech .
thank you .
one of my favorite words is &quot; <unk> &quot; in the entire Oxford Republic .
not only because it sounds good .
and it means &quot; a self @-@ serving politician . &quot;
even though this is just a wonderful definition by a 19th @-@ century paper editor , his father said , &quot; <unk> is a guy like this , he won &apos;t care for any party party or any principle , or any stage or any principle , or even a creator has written his words , &quot; won &apos;t win . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand what the word means .
it &apos;s about the word &quot; speech , &quot; I suppose .
but speech is very important for the political core , and all politicians understand that they have to try to control their <unk> .
so for example , it &apos;s been around the <unk> , which allowed news stories to report the true words that politicians have said in the morning .
and it &apos;s actually all because of a brave man , the great name is <unk> <unk> , which suggested in Parliament .
he was lost to London &apos;s <unk> , but he was brave enough to have enough courage to suggest in the parliament and ended up having so many voices in London that he won the victory .
and just a few years later , we had the first record of using the word &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
a lot of people think that phrases came out of metal .
no , it comes from an E @-@ terrorist act .
but in the real sense of how words and politics influence each other , I want to take you back to the United States , when it &apos;s just closed .
there was a question about how the name was George Washington , their leaders .
they don &apos;t know .
why should we be the leaders of a republic ?
and that &apos;s a long time ago in Congress .
and there &apos;s a lot of advice , which seems to work .
I mean , some people want to call him the lead <unk> Washington , and others call him George Washington , and others call him George Washington , and other people call him George Washington , D.C.
there &apos;s not a name of <unk> .
some people just want to call him the king .
they think it &apos;s a term they used and tested .
they don &apos;t even have a general monarchy , and their idea was that you could be the king of the election , there was a fixed master .
you know , it probably works .
and everyone was feeling tired , in fact , because the argument had lasted three weeks .
I read a journal of the poor legislators at the time , and it &apos;s continuing , &quot; and it was the issue . &quot;
and the reason why it &apos;s getting old is because of the House &apos;s Senate .
the House of Representatives wanted to let Washington D.C.
they didn &apos;t want to call him the king just in case he or the <unk> of his .
so they gave him a name that they could think of , the worst , the worst , the worst title of centuries .
and the title is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
they didn &apos;t create this title . I mean , it used to be , but it was the owner of a meeting .
similar to the president of the jury .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be very different than &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and although occasionally there are talks about small colonies that have a sense of government governance , but it &apos;s actually not a title .
and that &apos;s why the Senate against this title .
they said it was ridiculous , you couldn &apos;t call him the conference host .
and this man had to sign treaties and <unk> .
who &apos;s going to take it seriously , if he had a little nonsense like that , like the federal government host the United Way .
and after three weeks of argument , the Senate has not rested .
instead , as an alternative , they agreed to have a title of &quot; <unk> , &quot; but they also wanted to be absolutely certain that they were not agreeing that this was given to the advice and the respect of the civilization @-@ state , whether it &apos;s the Republicans or the Republicans or the Republicans or the Republicans of the chief &apos;s office , that we don &apos;t want to be surrounded by the foreign -- and the foreign people who don &apos;t want to be brilliant people who don &apos;t want to be buried in the foreign
now you can see three interesting things from this story .
first of all , which is my favorite place , and so far all the data I &apos;ve ever found , the Senate has never been properly recognized as the name of the President .
Barack Obama , the title of President Obama &apos;s &quot; President Obama , &quot; was still on the waiting for the Senate , just stunned at the Queen of the Senate .
the second thing you can see is that when the U.S. government <unk> this as a ad -- it &apos;s going to last decade .
but the third thing you can see , and it &apos;s also a very important thing , and I want you to remember the point , which is this letter , the federal government , as the president of the United Nations , sounds like it never meant any status , doesn &apos;t it ?
there &apos;s more than 5,000 pits of all the nuclear warheads that were held by him , and the largest economy in the world , and there &apos;s a lot of <unk> and all his military .
reality and history gave this title of a noble meaning .
so the Senate won .
they had a great title for them .
and another thing that the Senate had worried about , which was a bizarre title -- oh , it used to sound very strange in those days .
but now , do you know how many countries now have a president ?
it was a horse .
and that &apos;s because they wanted their title to sound like the guy with 5,000 pits , etc .
so at the end of the Senate , winning the House of Representatives lost , because no one &apos;s been told they &apos;re now President of the federal government .
and it &apos;s an important lesson that I think you can learn , and that &apos;s the point I want to leave you with .
politicians choose the word very <unk> and use the vocabulary of the word &quot; shape and control reality , but in fact , the reality is far more than the reality that words change .
thank you very much .
I was in <unk> along the battles of 50 to the <unk> battle in Florida , and when I was 19 , I was an 19 @-@ year @-@ olds and <unk> in Florida .
I took my black <unk> and I changed my <unk> of a brown pair of <unk> , and I blew up a rocket that I saw in the tanks of <unk> .
this was the first time I went to Afghanistan .
earlier in the war , I grew up on weekends at friend <unk> , watching football , competing kids , fought against religious <unk> and <unk> : &quot; getting <unk> to the <unk> , Afghanistan ! &quot; and then even in the absence of any idea what that means when burning a statue , a statue of the arts burned off .
but that &apos;s the form of self .
so I &apos;m standing here today with the blood of Afghanistan , and the way God honored me as an atheist and a radical political artist , and spent the last nine years in Afghanistan , working and writing .
in Afghanistan , you can show a lot of wonderful things through the art of creating art , but I don &apos;t want to paint the words , I want to create the narratives of identity , the challenge of the identity , the kinds of behavioral challenges , the descriptions of the real world that we live in .
I want to live a day with a <unk> , a day in which he has <unk> the <unk> of communism , and use religious threats and <unk> himself to be rich .
the molecule was passed to Congress not only to go to the public elections , but to quote me , &quot; <unk> me ! I &apos;m a mistake molecule . what can I do ? &quot;
I tried to <unk> out the <unk> of the <unk> , which made up of the national heroes .
I wanted to see the corruption of a work called &quot; <unk> &quot; in Afghanistan , and I wanted to create a fake <unk> on the streets of Kabul in Kabul , and stop that truck not a bribe , but to the name of the police station in Kabul , and to give them money to the name of the 100 restaurants in Kabul , and to the name of Afghanistan .
and I wanted to know how to illustrate Afghanistan &apos;s conflict with my point of view into conflict .
the war and the <unk> of the war created this kind of a style and fashion that was designed specifically for the soldiers and the fire of the bomb , so I added a local <unk> hairs on a pop bar with the brand new <unk> <unk> of Afghanistan with the brand new pocket .
and I also wanted to put together a simple Kabul and <unk> of Kabul in the wall to see and talk about how modern art evolved from the old tradition of the <unk> of the former dictator , the so @-@ called white &quot; to save the naked skin , even a little bit of civilization .
but in doing that , you might be the prison , and they would be misunderstood for .
but I had to do what I had to do because my ego asked me to do .
that &apos;s the kind of burden I have . what about yours ?
thank you .
Hi . I mean Cameron Russell , which used to be a model model .
well , 10 years .
now , I &apos;m in this room a <unk> of discomfort because I shouldn &apos;t wear this dress .
and Gene took another set .
this is the first live stage at TED , so I think everybody here is very fortunate .
if some women were terrified of me , they didn &apos;t have to tell me now , but I would Twitter right away .
and I want to tell you that I have the privilege of being able to change my image in your mind in 10 seconds .
it &apos;s not something everyone can do .
and the high @-@ heels are uncomfortable , and the good news was that I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
the worst news is I &apos;m going to pour this sweater out of my head , because you were laughing at me , so when I wear my wear , nothing to do .
that &apos;s it .
so why did I do this ?
it &apos;s strange .
well , I hope that &apos;s not going to be freaky like this .
the imagery is powerful , but at the same time it &apos;s also powerful .
I just changed my image in six seconds .
in this photograph I actually don &apos;t have a boyfriend in real life .
as the photographer had to memorize my back , I was very uncomfortable with the hair of that guy .
and sure enough , besides the surgery or the <unk> that I worked in for the last two days , we were basically not able to change our appearance , even the proxy , the solid , the solid shape of our lives .
so today , for me , the pace of change means being honest .
I stand here today because I &apos;m a model model .
and I &apos;m on this stage because I &apos;m a beautiful , white woman , and we call it &quot; sexy girl . &quot;
and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people often ask me , in a more honest way .
the first question is , how do you become model ?
I always say , &quot; I &apos;m discovered , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t really mean anything .
and the real reason I became a model model is because I have great genes , and I &apos;m an inherited receiver , and you may be asking what legacy is .
well , in the last couple of centuries , the beauty of beauty that we define is not just health , young and small shapes , but the elements that we celebrate for our biological instincts , the <unk> , the body color , the color of the skin .
that &apos;s my legacy , and that &apos;s the legacy that I &apos;ve been <unk> about .
I know some of you may be familiar with this idea , and you may have some fashion <unk> characters like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
first of all , I want to give you credit for what you know about models .
but unfortunately , I have to tell you , a Ph.D. from California in 2007 inspired by the number of people who were models in the workforce , only 27 out of three typical models , less than four percent of the white people were white .
the next question was , &quot; Am I grown up as models ? &quot;
my first answer was , &quot; I don &apos;t know , because they didn &apos;t let me take this thing . &quot;
but the second answer , which I want to ask , is , &quot; Why ? &quot;
you know what ? you can choose any profession .
you could be the president of the United States , or the next generation of the Internet , or the next generation ninja , which is great , because you &apos;re the first .
and if I listen to this , they say , &quot; No , no , no , I want to be a model model , &quot; I &apos;ll say , &quot; When my boss . &quot;
because I can &apos;t determine anything , you can be the editor of the editor of American magazine or the next R &amp; amp ; M , or the next R &amp; amp ; D.
when you grow up , you want to be a model , as you say when you grow up , you want to win the lottery .
it &apos;s not within your grasp . it &apos;s a great model , but it &apos;s not a business model .
I &apos;m going to show you some of my experiences as a model @-@ models for a decade , because it &apos;s not like a Japanese poet is its only real inspiration , and that &apos;s where we are today .
so if the photographer is here , the lights are right here -- beautiful <unk> of the client who said , &quot; Cameron , I want to take a bullet , &quot; which has this long front round of the arm , put it back three @-@ quarters of an arm , which goes back to the 400 times , and look back , and look at your 400 friends .
it looks like this .
I don &apos;t want to be that strange .
I don &apos;t know how it was .
the reality is , when you graduate out with résumés , and you &apos;ve done the <unk> work , you can &apos;t come back to the rest of it , so if you say you want to be president of the United States , but you &apos;ve written on your résumé , and people smile for 10 years .
the next question people ask is , &quot; Are they looking for pictures ? &quot;
yes , they &apos;re almost all photos , but this is just a small part of the work .
this was the first prototype I ever had , the first time I ever wore a <unk> , and I hadn &apos;t had an adolescence .
I knew it was a little private , but I was also young .
this was a photograph I photographed with the grandmother a few months ago .
this is a picture of the day .
my friend and I were there .
this was a picture of me a few days ago in the <unk> &apos;s pajamas .
this is a picture of my team and <unk> magazine .
this is me right now .
what I want you to understand is that these are not my photographs .
it &apos;s based on a group of professionals , <unk> , photographers and photographers and their <unk> and their <unk> , and they created these images in <unk> , not me .
the next question is , &quot; Can you get free ? &quot;
I &apos;m so many that I &apos;ve never had an eight @-@ inch high @-@ heels , but the free thing that I &apos;ve gained in real life , and that &apos;s exactly what we don &apos;t want to talk about .
I was in Cambridge , the mayor of Cambridge , and I walked into a store and forgot money , and they gave me a dress .
when I was teenagers , I was driving along with friends , and she was a terrible driver , and we had a red light in the red light , and I was just like , &quot; Sorry , I &apos;m sorry , we &apos;re on the road .
I got these because my appearance wasn &apos;t me . some people pay for their appearance instead of the identities .
I live in New York , and last year , 14 million young boys were parking in New York City last year , 86 percent of them are black and Latin America , mostly young boys .
and in New York , young black and Latino men are only 17 thousand , so the question is , &quot; Am I going to be park ? &quot;
it was , &quot; I &apos;m going to stop a few times ? when will I stop ? &quot;
and when I did this research in the United States 13 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , 53 percent of their bodies didn &apos;t like them to 17 years old , and that ratio went up to 78 percent .
so the last question is , &quot; What does a model feel like ? &quot;
and I guess the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you &apos;re a bit thinner , your hair &apos;s got a bit more <unk> , you &apos;re going to be very happy . &quot;
when we come back , we give an answer like this .
and we said , &quot; Look , it &apos;s great to be able to travel around and be creative and fun . &quot;
that &apos;s half the truth , but it &apos;s only half of the truth , because what we &apos;re never going to say before is , I will never say , &quot; I don &apos;t feel safe . &quot;
because I had to worry about me every day .
if you &apos;ve ever wondered , if my thigh was ever smaller , my hair was better , would I be happier ?
you just have to go and look at models because they have the most thin coat , the most beautiful hair , the coolest clothing of the world , and they may be the most <unk> woman in the world .
so when I was prepared for this presentation , it was hard to find a sense of honesty , because on the one hand , if I stand here and say , &quot; Look , I got so many things out of nature &apos;s advantage , &quot; and it &apos;s uncomfortable to say , &quot; but it &apos;s not going to make me happy . &quot;
but the hardest part was to show the traditions of sex and racism , because I was the greatest benefit of myself .
but at the same time , I was very happy and respected , standing here , and I was young , not working for 10 , 20 or 30 years , more and more <unk> between the business and the model industries than getting the most direct feelings , because maybe I wasn &apos;t going to talk about how my first business was about as important as the way it was today .
and if this talk can benefit you , I hope that we all embrace the power of imagery , the success and the failures that we understand and the failure that we understand .
thank you .
I just want one thing to do today .
don &apos;t say I &apos;m sane .
I want to introduce you to my two brothers .
he was 22 years old this year .
he didn &apos;t speak , but he was able to give a pleasure in his particular way , and the best title of his presentation is <unk> .
he knows what love is .
he was unconditional ; he shared his love .
he didn &apos;t care what other people were skin .
he didn &apos;t care about the difference of religion , and : he never did .
when he &apos;d sing the songs of our childhood , even as I &apos;ve forgotten them , he reminded me that we know so little about the unknown , so fascinating .
that &apos;s 16 years old , and it &apos;s pretty hot .
he had phenomenal memory .
but the memory is selective .
he didn &apos;t remember my chocolate , but remember the warmth of my iPod released when he was four years old , and we were talking about <unk> <unk> on my arm , and Lady Gaga pregnant women &apos;s birthday .
sounds amazing , right ?
but a lot of people don &apos;t think that .
the truth is , because their minds are not socially defined by normal people , they &apos;re often buried , often misunderstood .
but what blew my mind was that even though this was true , even though they were not seen as normal , it was just one thing that they were remarkable , even though they were autism , they were autism .
some of you may not know too much about &quot; autism , &quot; which is a term that is caused by complex brain disorders , social disorders , learning disabilities , sometimes sport dysfunction .
every single case is different , so it &apos;s different from Sam .
every 20 minutes around the world , there &apos;s a new diagnosis of autism diagnosis , even though it &apos;s one of the fastest @-@ growing diseases of the world , but we don &apos;t know why it &apos;s so well being treated .
the first time I know that &quot; autism &quot; happened for the first time in the word &quot; autism , &quot; and I &apos;ve also learned about one day that &quot; autism &quot; means nothing . &quot;
when I was three years old , my brother was born , and I got a new family .
and just a few months later I realized he was different .
he was screaming .
he didn &apos;t want to play like any other baby , and in fact , he was not interested in me .
he was so immersed in his own world , and using his own laws , he looked for the delight in things like <unk> around the room , looking at all the washing machines and the washing machines and the washing machines and the washing machine .
and as he grew up , he became more unique in these special places .
apart from the <unk> of constant <unk> , depression and the really beautiful nature of his inability to look at the world , he &apos;s a man who never lied to .
it &apos;s too simple .
I couldn &apos;t deny the family that there was a tough time , and I thought they were like me .
but then I moved to what they taught me about personality and connection and love and love , and I realized that these things I didn &apos;t want to be normal .
the differences between the beauty and the human beings are not the ones that are wrong .
it &apos;s just that there are different species .
I just want to say one sentence , which is that for Sam , you don &apos;t have to be normal . &quot;
you can be phenomenal .
whether it &apos;s the difference between autism and us -- each and every one of us has a gift to be fair , to be honest , &quot; normal &quot; is to kill the potential .
the possibility of transcendence , progress and change is the possibility that we want to disappear as others .
don &apos;t say I &apos;m normal . &quot;
thank you .
Dr. <unk> took the photo of this bullet and the wonder , and the time it took for a million seconds .
but now , 50 years later , we can get a million times faster , not only in a million seconds , or a billionth of a second , but in a trillion seconds , capture the world .
now I &apos;m going to show you a new camera technology called <unk> imaging , which is a technology so quickly that it can capture light .
so with this technology , we can create cameras around the corner of the window , and you can see beyond the horizon or the X @-@ ray of the body , the camera challenges our definition of the camera .
now , if I use a laser pen , and a switch on one in a trillion seconds -- that &apos;s a couple of times -- I &apos;m going to create some photons , these photons are <unk> across , and those photons are like a bullet , which is a million times the speed of light .
now , what if you put the bullet in this bottle , what would all these photons do ?
what &apos;s the slow speed of light ?
now , the whole thing ...
now , remember , this whole thing happened within a ship -- that &apos;s exactly the time of <unk> -- but now I &apos;m going to slow this video a million times slower , as you can see the light in the sports movement .
but Coke has not funded the experiment .
now , there &apos;s a lot of stuff going on here , so let me give you a demonstration .
now , the beam of light goes into the bottle , which is our bullet , goes through the bottle , and puts it inside .
some of them came out , went to the table , so you started seeing the pattern .
many photons eventually got to the caps and went all around .
and as you can see , here &apos;s an air tank , it bounce off .
and at the same time , the waves went to the table , and because of the reflection on the top of the jar , you can see that as it &apos;s underneath the bottle bottom , it &apos;s reflected .
now , if you walk the same distance with a regular bullet , which is a million times slower , you know how long you need to wait for to see this sequence ?
one day , a week ? actually , a year .
and this is , of course , boring , regular bullet points .
but what about some of the <unk> ?
you can see the waves unfold over and over again on the table , the background is tomato and wall .
it &apos;s like throwing a rock in a tank .
and I thought , this is how nature builds tomatoes , a <unk> , but of course what our eyes see is the sum of all .
but if you look at this tomatoes , you &apos;ll notice that as the <unk> walks on the tomato , it &apos;s shining all the time . it &apos;s not darkened .
why ? because tomatoes are familiar , and reflection from the inside of them , comes out of the tens of thousands of seconds after the thousands of seconds .
so , in the future , when imaging cameras are in your cell phone , you can go to the mall , and you can check out if the fruit is good enough .
so how did my team at MIT make this camera ?
now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to wear light , you only have a little bit of light , but we need a million times faster than the shortest collection of time , so you &apos;re almost not getting any light .
so what we did was , we changed the photons all the same way , and we repeated it all the time , all the way through wonderful <unk> , and then all the data from a few of the data , we created a picture , and this image you saw earlier .
and we take all of that raw data and add it to it , and it &apos;s fun to do .
now , Superman can fly .
some other heroes can be invisible , but imagine a future hero : he can see things behind .
and that &apos;s how we can put some of the door onto the door .
and these lights reflect into the room , and some of them go back to the door and go into the camera , and then we can use those optical reflection .
that &apos;s not a metaphor . we did .
on the left you see our <unk> imaging cameras .
there &apos;s a little wall behind the wall , and we &apos;re going to do a lot of different things .
so , in our papers , published in &quot; Nature , &quot; which was recommend the Mother of nature , and they created this animation .
we &apos;re going to launch these bullets , and they &apos;re going to hit the wall , and because the light is going to come in all directions , some of them will eventually hit our hidden <unk> , and it will continue to know that the door will reflect some light , and some of the light will come back to the camera , but some of them will return to the most fun of the time .
and because we have a camera that can run so fast , that &apos;s our hidden camera , and that camera has a remarkable ability .
it has good time resolution , and it can capture the world at the speed of light .
so not only do we know where the camera is going to the gate , but we know where the depth of the object is , but we don &apos;t know which distance it is .
so with a laser , we can record a pristine photo , and that &apos;s what you see on the screen , it &apos;s kind of meaningless , but then we &apos;ll take a lot of photos , lots and lots of them , put them together and analyzing the reflection , can we see that hidden object ?
can we look at pop @-@ up ?
that &apos;s our model to rebuild .
now we &apos;ve used them in the lives , but in the future , we can put this technology in the van so that the car wouldn &apos;t prevent impact , because they can see , or we can helicopter survivors , because we can look in the window , or we can see the device , or we can actually see the device in the window , or we can see the body of light , or the bone .
but of course , because of the accumulation of tissues and blood , it &apos;s quite difficult to ask scientists to really value the next generation of models for solving the next generation of healthy problems .
now , like Dr. Love <unk> , a scientist , science became art , a high @-@ speed science , and I realized that every time we collected a lot of data , not only science imaging , but a new computation photography , this technology contains the <unk> and color code , and we just remember one of those curves in time .
but something interesting is happening .
and when you see the pattern of these lid covers , they &apos;re dying .
but these waves should move to us .
what happened ?
and as a result , because we &apos;re <unk> these things at the speed of light , we have some weird scenarios , and Einstein &apos;s quite pleased to see these pictures .
the sequence of events happened in the cameras sometimes turn upside down , so we can <unk> this <unk> of time and space .
so whether it &apos;s seeing the corner , whether it &apos;s making a healthy video for the next generation , or whether it &apos;s added new visualization , and since our invention , we &apos;ve put all of the details and details online , and we hope , this DIY group , this creative research group can tell us that we shouldn &apos;t get into the next round of technologies -- the technologies are starting to be more interesting .
it &apos;s about time . thank you .
this is where I live , Kenya , in the southern part of Nairobi National Park .
behind me was my father &apos;s cattle in the back of the cow park in Nairobi .
the southern part of the National Park in Nairobi has not gathered all around the bars , which means that like zebras can move outside of the park .
so predators like lions follow them , and that &apos;s what they did .
they killed our livestock .
and this is one of the cows that was killed at night , and I woke up in the morning and it was dead , and it was in my mind , because it was the only cow in my house .
and our <unk> believed that we were our animals and our home from heaven to dung , life , that &apos;s why we value them .
so I became very <unk> to lions .
the mangroves are the warriors who protect our family and our livestock , but they &apos;re also frustrated about this problem , and they &apos;re frustrated .
so they decided to killed the lion .
this is one of six lion lions killed in Nairobi National Park .
and I think that &apos;s why there &apos;s so little housing in Nairobi .
in our family , six to nine @-@ year @-@ olds have the duty to protect their father , the same cause happened to me .
so I had to figure out a solution .
the first way I thought of it was to use fire , because I knew that lions were terrified of fire .
but I realized that it didn &apos;t make any sense , and it helped the lion to see our <unk> .
but I didn &apos;t give up . I was quiet .
so there &apos;s a second method : use of gold .
I wanted to deceive lions to get them right next to me .
but lions are very clever .
and the first day they saw <unk> , and they went back , but the next day , they would come back and say , &quot; This thing has never happened , and he stayed here . &quot;
so they were breeding and killed animals .
and one night , I was walking along with the flashlight , and the lions weren &apos;t there .
and I started to realize that lions tend to fear the light of moving .
so I had an idea again .
because I was a kid , and I could just spend a whole day and a half a day in my room and a half a day , and I even stuck my mom on the radio , and that day she nearly killed me , I learned a lot about electronics .
so I found an old <unk> , an optical lure . this is a small equipment that came out of a motorcycle that controls the <unk> of a motorcycle so it could shine light .
and at the same time I found a switch , and I was able to control the light of the lights .
the light bulb came from a broken flashlight .
everything was ready .
as you can see , the solar cell picks up a battery and gives it back to a battery , and then it turns out to be powered by a battery , and I call this &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and this pointer actually <unk> the light .
and you can see , the light bulb was a light bulb because lions came from there .
and what you see when the lion comes up at night is this .
the light would be thrown away from the lion , and they would expect me to walk around the emergency room , but in fact , at this time I was making a big dreams on my bed .
thank you .
I &apos;d put this in my house since two years ago , and since then , we had no more lion <unk> .
my neighborhood had heard about it .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a whole bunch of <unk> fed up with lions , and she asked me if I could help her to have a light in her house .
I was freezing .
I have these lights , and you can see behind , and these are the <unk> .
and so far , I &apos;ve been living in this community of <unk> , and they &apos;re very useful .
now , my approach has been used for everybody in Kenya to avoid other predatory animals , like hyena , and the leopard waiting for them to be chased away from the human farm .
and I was also blessed by the invention of this innovation , and this is the best school in Kenya -- the international school -- I was excited about this .
my new school now comes in and helps me know and raise more money .
I even brought my friends back to my community , helping them to install this in the homes of people that were not installed .
a year ago , I was just a normal zoo of ordinary boys in the savanna helping my dad , and I used to look at the plane , and tell myself , one day , I &apos;ll be inside .
today , I did .
I got an opportunity to fly to TED , and this was my first time .
so my great dream is : when I grew up , I became an aircraft engineer and a pilot .
I used to hate lions , but now , because of my invention , I saved my father &apos;s cattle and we were finally able to get lions alive .
thank you very much . in my language , it means very much .
you don &apos;t believe how inspiring your story is .
so you &apos;ve got this scholarship . Richard Wurman : yes .
are you doing another electron inventing ?
what &apos;s your next project ?
<unk> : my next invention was , I want to make an electric bar . electricity fence ?
LM : I know , the electricity bars are already there , but I just want to make my own one .
you &apos;ve tried it once , right , but you -- <unk> : I &apos;ve tried it before , but I stopped it because it <unk> me .
it &apos;s going to be a blessing . Richard Wurman , you &apos;re different .
we &apos;re going to <unk> every step you &apos;re growing up , friends .
thank you very much . <unk> : thank you .
I live in Los Angeles .
this is L.A. <unk> : hotel , fast food restaurants , dirty water .
so the planners of the city sit together and talk about what it means to change the name of Los Angeles , so they changed it to Southern Los Angeles , as though it &apos;s going to be a real problem for the city .
this is Los Angeles .
there &apos;s <unk> hotels , there &apos;s vacant land .
and just like about 200 million other Americans , I live in the deserts of food , and Los Angeles gives birth to a new business model , where customers don &apos;t have to get out of their car and their cars .
and the interesting thing is that there &apos;s more people to be killed by <unk> .
in Los Angeles , people were dying to cure disease .
for example , the reason I live in a block is five times the size of a block that I live in , perhaps eight times smaller than the rest of our neighborhood .
I was tired of the reality .
and I &apos;m thinking , if there &apos;s no way to get healthy food , what do you feel if every time you come out of your house and see the food systems in your community , what &apos;s your feeling ?
I saw the wheelchair as a bought @-@ crude automobile .
I see the <unk> center like Starbucks .
I don &apos;t want to be there anymore .
I think the answer is already hidden in the question .
food is the problem ; food is the solution .
plus I was tired of driving a 45 @-@ minute round buying an apple that wasn &apos;t sold by pesticides .
so what I did was I put food in my house .
it &apos;s in what we call <unk> .
150 feet by 10 feet .
<unk> are all government .
but people need to keep it .
so I thought , &quot; Great ! this is my responsibility , I have to maintain it , so I want to do something ! &quot;
that &apos;s why I want to maintain it .
so my team and I , &quot; L.A. &quot; came together and started growing our own food forests , green and full of green vegetables .
we are a free organization made up of different cities , all volunteers , all of them , all of our duty to do .
the garden was beautiful .
but soon somebody complained .
the government <unk> me , gave me a message , and I had to take away my garden and turn it into a warning .
and I was like , &quot; What , really ?
it wasn &apos;t enough to be saved before a small patch of land that wasn &apos;t there ?
and I thought , &quot; cool , that &apos;s it . &quot;
because nothing happened .
so the Los Angeles Times reported , Steven Pinker wrote a story about it and talked to the legislators and a <unk> member of the <unk> site , and they transmitted it to <unk> , and collected 900 signed , we succeeded .
we were successful with our hands .
and even the legislators came to visit , explaining how admired and loved what we were doing .
I mean , of course , how can they not do that ?
the amount of open spaces in Los Angeles in the upper quarter of the city in the United States .
it has 26 square kilometers of open space .
that &apos;s 20 Central Park .
there &apos;s enough space to grow 250 million species of tomato .
why did they feel so bad ?
a single tree can get a thousand , a thousand seed .
a dollar can produce 75 dollars for you .
this is my motto , and I tell people , grow your own food .
it &apos;s like its own food .
see , in Los Angeles I had the legacy .
I grew up there , and I raised my son there .
I refused to be part of the reality that other people made for me to create my reality .
see , I &apos;m an artist .
the gardening job is my graffiti , and I create my own art .
it &apos;s like the graffiti artist , they sort of <unk> the wall , and I , <unk> the lawns .
I looked at the garden and the land as canvas , and the plants and the trees are the decoration of my canvas .
you may be shocked what land can do if you think of it as your canvas .
you can &apos;t imagine how amazing it was , and what it would have on people .
what happens ?
I watched my garden become the tools of education , became the tool of my community reform .
to change communities , you have to change the components of the soil .
we are soil .
you &apos;d be shocked by how children affected .
the gardening movement is the most healthy and challenging activity , especially in the city .
add that to your partner .
and I remember one of the times when a mom and daughter came out in the almost 10 o &apos;clock in the evenings in my garden , when I came out and saw them , they were embarrassed .
their presence made me feel bad , and I told them , you don &apos;t have to take food like this .
this is why the garden garden was on the street .
and when I saw the people beside me , it made me feel very embarrassing . it became my determination to do my food . people ask me , &quot; Are you stealing from you ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; Of course I &apos;m not sure people will steal it .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
that &apos;s what I wanted .
I want people to take it , but at the same time , I want people to be healthy . &quot;
and one time later , a homeless kid in downtown Los Angeles set a garden .
the boys have helped me add up to the point .
it &apos;s cool . they shared stories about how the garden affected them and how they shared with their own mother and the grandmother , the stories that the garden can change how cool they are , just for this moment .
green fields started to place , maybe 20 garden .
we already have about 50 people involved in our team ; they &apos;re all volunteers .
if the kids grow food , the kids eat the <unk> .
if they grow the tomato , they eat the food .
but when these things are not present to the children , if they don &apos;t experience the way food affects people and the body , they &apos;re just <unk> eating any food in front of them .
I saw young people who wanted to work , but they were happy to spend a lot of time with this , and I saw kids who were different colors , and they were always <unk> people on the way they were designing for them , and there was a road .
and as the gardening campaign , I discovered an opportunity to train these children to take over their communities , to live a sustainable life .
when we did that , who knew whether we were going to be there .
next George Washington .
but if we don &apos;t change the components of soil , we never will .
it &apos;s one of my current plans . this is what I want to do .
I wanted a whole neighborhood garden of gardens that people could share food in this neighborhood .
I wanted to reinvent the shipping container for health .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
I didn &apos;t think free , because free is free .
and the nice thing about sustainability is that you have to keep it .
what I &apos;m talking about is getting people to work , to get kids out of the streets , to give them a sense of the joy of growing food , honor and pride , open farmers markets .
so what I wanted to do was to make it more appealing .
I wanted us to be the <unk> of the environmental revolution , the rogue , the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to bend rogue .
if you &apos;re not a flower , you &apos;re not a rogue .
what about next door @-@ door <unk> ?
let alone become the weapons you choose .
basically , if you want to meet me , if you want to meet me , if you want to talk about some of the missing devices in the comfortable chairs .
if you want to meet me , just take the garden and come to the garden so that we can just fill it up .
thank you .
thank you .
three months before March 2011 , I was a photographic <unk> , New York .
we were closed , we were <unk> .
we were in a room of pitch , <unk> , and the studio has no window , and mainly for the sun .
we were able to make a model that was thinner , to make the beauty of the skin , to make the impossible possible , and we were criticized by the media , but we were actually brilliant artists , experienced and photograph .
on March 11th , 2011 , like everyone around the world , I saw the tragedy of Japan at home .
soon after that , I participated in an organization called volunteer &quot; volunteer , &quot; and the team just went on for a couple of days , and within a few days , in a local emergency rescue event .
I know this with other volunteers : we can &apos;t sit at home . so I decided to join them for three weeks and volunteer .
on the 13th of May , I came to Japan .
that was a small fishing village in Japan , about 50,000 people were living in the early days of the disaster .
the tsunami was over 24 meters above 24 meters in the time of the tsunami hit two miles of inland .
as you can imagine , this little town must have suffered .
and we came out of that rubble and into the Gowanus .
we were helping school and the lost housing , cleaning up , rebuilding , <unk> .
we cleaned up a lot of <unk> , <unk> fish , which were all local factories and processed fish .
we also became very dirty and smelly , but we were very mad .
and within weeks , all the volunteers and the local people found something like this .
and they kept finding photos and photos and photographers and <unk> .
everybody &apos;s responding and act like that .
they collected these photos , collected them , sent them to <unk> .
and it wasn &apos;t until now that I realized that it was a big part of the loss that these people had lost .
and when they were attacked by the tsunami , and as you can imagine , you &apos;ve got to ask for <unk> , to take something else , to put everything in their hands .
I spent the last week in Japan , and I found myself in a place where I was trying to collect a place for <unk> .
help a clean clearance , a huge security guard .
it happened to be the photo that was collected by the Gulf of evacuated .
people sent photographs of that photo , and I was so lucky that I had the privilege of getting their trust and getting me to clean and back the pictures .
and that moment of interest , and it &apos;s very inspiring , and I &apos;ve been listening to people and saying , &quot; I &apos;ve got ideas ! I &apos;ve really achieved what &apos;s called innovation . &quot;
and when I look at those pictures , there are perhaps more than a hundred years of history , some of which are still stored in a envelope of wood in the lab , and I think from an <unk> point of view , maybe I can help them repair the photos of the <unk> and the <unk> , and I also know that a lot of people will help them recover these photos .
so , that evening , I went to Facebook and I asked some famous friends , and in the morning , in the morning , there were lots and lots of news saying they were willing to help , and I knew we should act .
so we started <unk> .
this was the first attempt .
it wasn &apos;t a hell of a lot of damage , but it was caused by a little girl &apos;s face , and we had to repair it very precisely .
otherwise , the face of the little girl &apos;s face doesn &apos;t look like her face -- <unk> tragedy , just like a picture destroyed .
and over time , more and more photos have been transported over time , and we have to have more pictures of it , and so I went back to Facebook and professional links and professional links , and just five days , eight of them came from 12 different countries .
within two weeks , I got 150 volunteers and they said they would join us .
and by July , only in Japan , we &apos;ve set up a <unk> tree that &apos;s nearby in the northern <unk> , with the <unk> trees in the north .
every week , we are scanning devices in the tent , and people come and take pictures of them .
sometimes , some of the older women have never seen a scanner , have found themselves lost a photograph in 10 minutes , and they can scan it to the cloud servers , and then upload it to the cloud , and later the photos of a Japanese or strangers , and they may come from one side of the other side of the Earth , are recovered .
and for that time , they were just completely different from the time they took the pictures back , and , of course , it was about the damage .
maybe an hour could repair it , or it would take weeks .
even months .
the beauty of this picture has to be processed by hand @-@ hand processes or little bits of paint , and process details about the colors that are not covered by water .
the whole process is very much time .
all of these pictures of the tsunami , and in brine , are lost in the trash , and are lost in the trash , and sometimes even fossil hunter , all of which have been <unk> for a while , so the artisanal photograph is a major part of the project .
and if these pictures don &apos;t clean , we can &apos;t fix them , and before we repair them , they have to dry and open up .
our hand @-@ washing activities are pretty good .
there was a lady in the neighborhood who taught us to clean .
these pictures are easy to fail again .
as the captain of my team once said , it &apos;s like getting tattoos right now .
you can &apos;t have any <unk> , otherwise it will pop a mess .
and the woman who gave us these photographs was very lucky , and in this photograph .
she started washing her pictures , until she realized that she had actually made more damage to the photograph .
okay , she has a copy of that photo .
otherwise , in this photograph , she and her face was completely fixed , and we were able to incorporate all of these parts into a good photograph and then re @-@ create this photo .
and as she took the picture from here , she shared some of the stories behind us .
the pictures of her actually discovered by her husband &apos;s colleagues , came out of the local fire brigade troops , and it was actually very far from her family , and they recognized him .
the day of the tsunami , he was making sure the tsunami is closed .
alarm goes on , and he has to be on the front lines of the tsunami .
her two sons , even though they &apos;ve been quite big , two different schools .
one of the children &apos;s school disappeared .
she spent a whole week and a half of her family back , and they were all dead .
and the day we got her back to the day of the photo , it was her 14th birthday .
and for her , although the deep and hard things were the best gift of his son , the pictures that allowed him to examine , regain memories , that it wasn &apos;t a <unk> of a day in March , when all of his life changed , or actually destroyed it .
six months after Japan spent six months in Japan , together with 100 volunteers , 100 volunteers to join the Japanese in helping us to clean the Japanese disaster , and many of them clean up more than 15 million pictures , most of them -- most of them .
most of it ends up in the back pocket , and it &apos;s important .
more than 500 volunteers around the world have given us a 90 @-@ household photograph of 90 families , and they &apos;re all reconstructed and repaired .
during that time , we didn &apos;t spend billions of dollars on devices or materials , and most of it was done with printers .
we take pictures a lot .
it &apos;s a photo of a remind and a reminder that some of us , some things , some place , a place , a place of affection , somebody who has loved .
they were helping us record , collected memories and our past , the most vulnerable time we were neglect , but sometimes the first thing we were looking for comes back .
and that &apos;s all of this project , just to give a little bit of back to the human nature , to save people from the past .
and when a picture of its owner , it will bring a huge difference , and it will bring a lot of difference in life .
the project also changed a lot for us .
and for some of the <unk> , this experience set up some connections , connections to some greater things , like feedback , social back , performing them , not only for models , but for the perfect skin .
I want to end by giving you an email from an email , and I get an email from <unk> , six months later from Japan .
&quot; and as I was fixing those photographs , I was reminded of the stories that everybody and the photographs were given .
and in particular , a woman who took all of that picture , and went to the grandmother , and went to the grandmother , next to a little baby , and it was a lot of shock , because I had a photo like this , my grandmother , my mother and I , this picture of my family in my house .
all around the world , all over the age lines , we have some of the most fundamental needs of all the time , right ? &quot;
thank you .
today , I want to talk about a disconcerting question , and the answer to that question also <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk about the secret of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to answer is , &quot; Why is she staying ? &quot;
&quot; how would somebody live with a man with a fire ? &quot;
I &apos;m not a psychopath , social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
I &apos;m just a woman with an experience .
I was 22 years old , just graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York , and I started my first job as magazine and <unk> .
the first time I had my own house , I had the first credit card . I had a very big secret .
and the secret was that I was once identified as the man of my soul had used it to take a hollow out of a hollow gun of my head as many , many times .
this man I loved , <unk> pointed to my head and threatened to kill me , and I had no idea how many times I had done .
now the story I &apos;ve told you about this crazy love story is a psychological trap of romantic love , and a million women every year , including some men falling into this trap .
maybe it &apos;s happening to you .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic victim .
I had a college degree of English education at Harvard , and I got an MBA degree in business school as well as business marketing .
and most of the time is working for the Fortune 500 companies , including Johnson , and Washington , D.C.
I married my husband for almost 20 years with three children .
I had a black <unk> , a <unk> van .
and that &apos;s the first fact I want to tell you about : domestic violence may not have to happen to everyone in your ethnic , belief , income and education .
it &apos;s everywhere .
the second thing I want to talk about is that many people think that since domestic violence is happening to women , it should be women .
no .
over 85 percent of the <unk> are men , and the country is only happening in intimacy , in a long @-@ term relationship , in other words , in families , and that &apos;s one of the things that we most don &apos;t want to see , or the most desired places of violence , which is one of the reasons why domestic violence is so called domestic violence .
I thought that there was only one person in the world that was going to stay with my man , but it was actually a very common age in my age .
I was 22 years old . whereas in the United States , 16 to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds were more likely to be killed by more women than any other age , and in the United States , every year more than 500 women or <unk> were killed by 50,000 , or their husband or husband .
I &apos;m a very typical victim , and I know nothing about my emerging model of domestic violence and development .
I met <unk> in a pool of water , and it was January , and it was freezing .
we sat on the subway in New York , and he talked to me first .
he told me two things .
the first was that he graduated from Connecticut school , and worked in a great Wall Street bank .
but the first thing that left me was his wisdom and humor , and his <unk> seemed like a farm boy .
his face looked like a giant <unk> of wheat in the palm of an apple , looking very <unk> .
the most brilliant thing that happened to me in the first few years of my life is to convince me that I was a strong side .
and especially at the beginning , he made me feel that I was an icon of his worship .
and we started getting involved , and he liked everything I was about , like my brilliant , and I was at Harvard &apos;s School , and I was giving birth to young women , and my work .
he wanted to know my family , my childhood , my wish and my dreams .
as a woman and a <unk> , I had never been there before as a woman or a <unk> .
and through his unknown secrets , he creates this incredible emotional atmosphere of trust among us , and he tells me that he begins his four @-@ year @-@ olds , which are beginning to wipe him up on the body , which is what happened to him when he had to drop out in eighth grade , although he spent almost 20 years of his life .
and that &apos;s why the degrees of return to university , the jobs and the bright future of Wall Street , were significant to him .
if somebody said this to me at the time that this smart , humor and <unk> and love my man will have a day to decide whether I &apos;m makeup or not , my skirt is able to blow up a dress , what am I going to spend and who are going to be friends with , because I &apos;m going to laugh at you , because I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m having any violent or violent or violent control a little violence or violent or
and I didn &apos;t know that , by the time , by the way , that the first step in terms of domestic relations .
I didn &apos;t know at the time that the second stage was an isolated victim .
not home , not back home , announced to me , &quot; Hey , it &apos;s great , but we &apos;re going to come into the next phase of this , and I &apos;m going to torture you , and I &apos;m going to leave you with your own apartment , preventing your neighbors , and I &apos;m going to leave you with your friends and family . &quot;
and the truth is , he came home at a Friday night and told me he quit his job , and he always wanted to quit his job , and he said he was because I quit school , and he had an incredible happiness and security , and he didn &apos;t have to go to Wall Street , and now he just wants to leave the city as normal , as it was for New England .
and what I didn &apos;t want to do was leave New York and leave my favorite job , but for my own soul , I thought I needed to make a sacrifice . so I agreed to quit my job and leave Manhattan with the <unk> .
I thought I was in a crazy romantic love and I didn &apos;t know that I had come into a rigorous narrative of the control of your body , your soul and your economy .
and the third phase of the domestic violence is starting to see her response .
that &apos;s what the gun used .
we just moved to the New England little -- I think the New York Times should be safe here -- and he bought the gun guns .
and one was put in a van .
a pillow underneath the bed , the window is still in your pocket .
he said that the post @-@ traumatic event that he needed was this gun .
to keep him safe .
the gun was an obvious signal to me , even though he didn &apos;t pick a dot to me , I was no longer at the edge of the danger .
the first five days before my wedding hit .
that was the morning <unk> , and I was wearing <unk> .
I was working with a computer , and I wanted to do a series of <unk> , and I was kind of <unk> , and I was kind of trying to get my neck out of my neck , getting my neck into the wall .
five days later , 10 fingers on my neck came back , and I put on my mom &apos;s <unk> and married him .
and even though that happened , I still believe that we can live happily in the future because we love it .
and he expressed his deep inner self .
he was just too much stress , and the wedding meet came and gave him a break .
this was an accident , and he wouldn &apos;t hurt me later .
I was struck twice during the <unk> .
for the first time , I was driving to search for the secret beach , and I was lost , and he was beaten my head in the driver &apos;s side , and pushed so hard that my head pushed into the glass on the front wheel .
the traffic jams that he &apos;d been driving home from his late night before he was too upset , and he threw a cold Mac in my face .
in the two and a half years of my <unk> , I was beaten twice a week .
I had always had one of them .
in fact , one out of three American women once was a domestic victim or potentially potentially foreign , and the report that every year has 1,500 million child abuse , 15 million dollars a year .
so in fact , I &apos;m not alone .
back to my question : why am I staying ?
and the answer is simple .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
even though he pointed to my head with a gun on an old gun , he pushed me over to kill my dog , to kill our keys on the freeway , and on the freeway , I had never thought of myself as a abuse of my wife .
on the contrary , I was a very strong woman in love with this troubled woman , and I was the only person in the world that could help to deal with the circumstances of my life .
the other question everyone wanted to ask was , why didn &apos;t she leave ?
why didn &apos;t I flee ? I had a lot of opportunities .
for me , this is the most sad and painful question people have ever asked me , and you can &apos;t understand , but only our victims know how dangerous it is to leave the <unk> themselves .
because the last step in domestic violence was to kill her .
more than 70 percent of domestic violence occurs after the victim ended this relationship , because the perpetrator has left behind .
other possible outcomes include long @-@ term tracking , or even <unk> of staff ; instead of supporting the economy ; <unk> family to prove to the victim and her children ; children are often asked to spend a time with the family judge and the men who elect their mother .
now we still ask , why don &apos;t she flee ?
and the reason I decided to leave was because of the last brutal breakthroughs that I could have ended up with .
and I realized that if I didn &apos;t resist , this man that I used to love to kill me .
so I broke my silence .
and I went to everybody : the police , the neighbors , my friends and family , totally strange people , and I can stand here today because everyone else helped me .
we tend to portray the victims into the words of the <unk> , the <unk> women of the news , the horrible title of the news .
&quot; why is she leaving ? &quot; asked this question .
some of you are actually saying , &quot; It &apos;s her own fault , as though the victim is intentionally and intended to <unk> their men in love .
but after the book came out , a lot of men and women told me their stories , and they wanted to tell people about what they learned from what happened , they learned from what happened , and they started living their lives -- happy lives as my wife , mothers and mothers , as mothers and mothers and mothers , as far away from the violent world that I live .
in fact , I &apos;m a typical domestic victim , a typical domestic survivor .
I was married to a wise man once again , three children .
I had a black <unk> , a <unk> van .
and what I will never have anymore , it will always be a mouth that says love my man has pointed at my head with a bullet .
you &apos;re probably thinking right now , wow , that &apos;s amazing , or , &quot; Oh , she &apos;s amazing , &quot; but in the process , I &apos;m actually talking about you .
I promise you , there are now a couple of people I &apos;m talking about right now who have been abused or been abused when you were a child , or you &apos;re a <unk> .
torture could happen to your daughter , happens to your sisters , your best friends .
I was able to end my own crazy love story about losing silence .
I &apos;m still losing silence today .
this is how I helped other victims , and my final request for your last request .
tell someone you &apos;ve heard today .
torture was only in silence .
you have the ability to stop domestic violence just to light up .
our victims need everyone .
we need each of you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
and with your kids , your colleagues , your friends and family discuss this topic , <unk> light .
helping survivors reclaim this wonderful , cute self , and reclaim the future .
it turns out that the decline of domestic violence and the potential for getting the victims to be safe .
let &apos;s take our beds and make our bed , our dining table and our family into the safe , peaceful oasis that they should be .
thank you .
when I was a child , I thought my country was the best in the world . and after a while I was a kid , I learned a song called <unk> .
I felt so proud .
in school , we spent a lot of time learning about the history of <unk> , but we never knew anything about the outside world , except that American , Korea and Japan were outside of the enemy .
and even though I always imagined the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea until all of a sudden everything changed .
when I was seven years old , I saw the public execution for the first time , but I thought I was living in North Korea .
my family wasn &apos;t poor . and for myself , I had no experience of starvation .
but one day in 1995 , my mom took a letter home from her sisters .
and it says , &quot; When you read this letter , all five of my family &apos;s died because we hadn &apos;t eaten for two weeks .
we &apos;re lying on the floor now , and our bodies are so sick and ready to die . &quot;
and I was shocked .
that was the first time I &apos;d ever heard that people in my country were suffering .
shortly after this , when I was walking through a train station , I saw a very painful thing that blew me away .
a dying woman was lying on the ground , holding a sick child , and that child was just desperate to see his mother &apos;s face .
but no one helped them , because you couldn &apos;t even support their own family .
North Korea , in the mid- &apos; 90s , had a terrible famine .
unfortunately , more than a million North Koreans died in famine , and a lot of these survivors depend on the <unk> , the <unk> and the roots of the tree .
the power was getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more every night in my home , except in China &apos;s lights , and as long as you pass through the river around me .
I often wonder why they have <unk> and we don &apos;t .
this is a satellite photograph of North Korea and <unk> at night .
this is a section of the border as part of China and North Korea .
as you can see , the river is very narrow in some places , and it &apos;s very narrow , and it &apos;s accessible to China .
but a lot of people tried to die .
sometimes I see the body in the water .
I couldn &apos;t disclose too much details that I left North Korea , but I could only say that the most difficult years of the famine , I was sent to China and to their relatives .
and I thought I was just separated from my family for a very short time .
but I never thought I &apos;d been there for 14 years .
in China , I was a very tough girl as a little girl .
I had no idea what it would be like to be a refugee camp for the future of North Korea , but I quickly realized that it wasn &apos;t just too much of a tough life , it was even dangerous , because North Korea was considered illegal immigrants in China .
so I always live in fear , and I fear my identity will be discovered , and I will send it back to North Korea , to accept the terrible destiny .
one day , my worst nightmare came true , and I was grabbed by the Chinese police and brought them to the police station for the police .
some people accuse me of being North Koreans , so the police tested my Chinese ability and asked me a lot of questions .
and I was very afraid , and I was feeling that my heart was speeding up because of fear .
if there were any <unk> , I would go to prison and send it back .
I thought I &apos;d finished my life , but still trying to hide my own fear and concerns and answer their questions .
after that , a cop says to another person , &quot; paper is wrong .
she &apos;s not North Koreans . &quot;
and they left me . it was a miracle .
some North Koreans were seeking asylum in China to go to the foreign island , but a lot of them were grabbed by the Chinese police , sent back to North Korea .
the girls were lucky .
despite the fact that they were caught , the great international community was ultimately released .
but a few North Koreans were too lucky .
every year , hundreds of thousands of North Koreans were arrested in China and sent it back to North Korea , and they were incarcerated or executed .
although I was lucky enough to leave North Korea , a lot of my people didn &apos;t have that good fortune .
it &apos;s a very tragic fact , and that &apos;s the fact that North Koreans have to have North Koreans , and are trying to survive .
even though they &apos;ve learned to Chinese , they found jobs , their whole world is fundamentally transforming .
and that &apos;s why , after 10 years in <unk> , I decided to take risks to Korea , and that &apos;s why I started a new life .
South Korea was more difficult and challenging than I could imagine .
English was too important in Korea , so I had to start learning the third door -- English .
moreover , I realized there was a huge difference between Korea and North Korea .
even though we were all human beings , our intentions were very different , because of the separated by &apos; 67 years .
I even experienced a question of self @-@ identity .
were I Korean or North Koreans ?
where did I come from ? who am I ?
and all of a sudden , I didn &apos;t seem to call any country for myself .
I still decided that I wanted to live in Korea , but I still wanted to .
he was going to go to college and buy it .
and soon after I got used to new life , I got an incredible telephone call .
the government stopped the bits that I sent home , and as punishment , my family was forced to move to a remote place in the countryside .
they had to run away , so I started planning to get them out .
North Koreans migrate to freedom , which is the norm .
it &apos;s almost impossible to go across the border of North Korea and Korea , so , ironically , I flew to China and then to the border .
because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , so I had to help them go through the <unk> and into Southeast Asia .
we &apos;ve been on the bus for a week , and several times are almost caught .
again and again , the bus that we sat in was replaced by a Chinese officer .
he looked at every individual ID card , and he started asking the question .
because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , I feared they were caught .
so when the Chinese officer quickly went to my house , my instincts came upon him , and I was their <unk> .
he <unk> looking at me , but luckily , he believed me .
so we went all the way to <unk> , but I would almost like to pay almost all the light to bribe the border .
and even though we had been arrested , my family was arrested for being given illegal to come to prison .
after I had paid the fine and the bribe , my family was released a month after a month , but soon after , they were in the capital of the <unk> capital , and they were caught .
that was one of the lowest moments in my life .
and I wanted my family to get freedom , and the thing I could do to get out of prison when it was almost successful , and the family had to go through a prison wasn &apos;t very far from North Korea .
I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in the <unk> and the police department , trying to get them out again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again , desperately trying to get them out , and I don &apos;t have enough money to pay for the bribe the fine .
I was freezing .
that &apos;s when I heard a guy asking me , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
and I was amazed by a completely stranger asking .
I had a really bad English with a dictionary , and I explained to that person what was going to happen . that guy went to the ATM machines , paid all of my family and two other North Koreans , and two North Koreans , and all the bills that came out .
and I really appreciate him and I say , &quot; Why are you going to help me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he replied .
I was helping North Korea . &quot;
and I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life .
that kindness stranger is a symbol of mine and North Koreans , and he made me understand that strangers are a great advocate for kindness and international communities that we need North Koreans to light .
and eventually , after a long trip , I and my family finally arrived in Korea , but getting freedom was only half of wars .
a lot of North Koreans and their families , and when they come to new countries , they usually have very little money or very little money .
so we can train education , English training , job training , and so on .
and we can also bridge the bridge between the people living in North Korea , because many of us live in North Korea and stay in touch with the family in North Korea , and all of the information and the money that we have gone back to North Korea in very different ways .
and I was so lucky that I had so much help and revelations in my life , so I wanted to help the North Koreans , the next international aid to create a dream .
and I &apos;m confident that you &apos;re going to see increasing prosperity in the world , including TED .
thank you .
now you may agree that this road may be great .
it &apos;s made of tar , which is a great material , and driving it well on top of it , but not always , especially the weather conditions like this today , the rainy season .
a lot of water was spilled in <unk> .
especially if you &apos;re riding a bicycle along the way , it &apos;s not that good .
and at the same time , noise produces a lot of noise .
it &apos;s a little bit noisy , and if we &apos;re going to build our roads , like the Dutch road , we &apos;re going to want little noise .
and the solution is to use tar sands .
porous tar sands , which is used on most highways in the Netherlands , has little pores that allow water to flow next to each other , and the roads are easy , the <unk> , the <unk> .
noise disappears in these pores .
because it has a lot of empty , it <unk> the sound , so the road is silent .
and of course , it has flaws , and the downside of that path is that the tar sands may be <unk> .
what &apos;s called a <unk> ? look at the rock off the road .
and I started one , and then it got more and more , and then -- I couldn &apos;t demonstrate .
but they &apos;re going to damage your windshield otherwise , you &apos;re certainly not pleased .
and in the end , it will cause more and more damage .
sometimes the road is available .
ah , he was ready early .
the problem of course becomes a problem , but we have a solution .
what you see here is the damage of this material .
this is the tar sands , as I said , there &apos;s a few hairs in the stone .
because <unk> , ultraviolet , <unk> , for reasons like this , this chalk , which occurs to the tar sands , the <unk> between the <unk> , if it breaks down , there &apos;s little <unk> that start to emerge from the NFL .
if you &apos;re driving along this way , you &apos;re going to see these <unk> -- that &apos;s what we see .
to solve this problem , we looked at self @-@ repair materials .
if we could make this material self @-@ repair , there could be a solution .
and what we &apos;re using is , we &apos;re using recycled steel , and steel , which can be small enough , and we can cut these little <unk> of asphalt .
so now the tar sands have some <unk> on it .
you need another machine like this , a <unk> motor -- that can be used for cooking .
sensing the motors can heat things , especially good at heated steel .
so what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to heat it up , melt the asphalt , melt it out of those small cracks , and then the electrons come out of those little cracks and stick it out .
because the sensing got too heavy , I showed it here with the <unk> .
it &apos;s similar to the principle of <unk> .
I put samples in there , and now I take it out and see what happened .
this is what it looks like today .
we have four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ dozen machines in our lab that heat the samples .
we tested lots of samples , government saw our results , and they decided , &quot; This is interesting , we should try . &quot;
government licensed an highways for free , gave us a 400 @-@ meter distance , and we did that material testing there .
and that &apos;s what we did . and what you see here is the city experimenting , of course , that &apos;s not going to be bad over years . we confirmed that in practice .
we took a lot of samples along the way and tested them in laboratories .
we did the old experiments , added a lot of <unk> with our sensors to heat them , heating and testing them .
we can make a difference .
in fact , the conclusion of this experiment was that if we had heated this machine every four years on this path -- the <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to move this machine to the highway -- we &apos;re going to double the length of the road , of course , a lot of money .
so the conclusion is that we &apos;ve created a material that we &apos;ve added a new way of perceiving energy , which is increasing the longevity of the road , which doubles as long as this simple technique , as well as a simple skill set .
you wonder if it works .
we looked at this prototype . it &apos;s a bit hot now .
in fact , I want to cool it down first to show you whether heated is effective .
but try .
see , really , it &apos;s built .
thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
there are four million birds on Earth .
the light blue is the most endangered of them .
and when you see the flower just like this , the first thing that comes to mind is that it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> the horrible creature that <unk> and chasing it , that you can &apos;t help but think of politicians .
and I want to change that way . I want to change the perception of the bad things that people have , because they need our compassion . they really need it .
let me tell you why .
first of all , why do they leave us alone ?
Charles Darwin &apos;s been on the shuttle ride through the Atlantic <unk> , and he said , &quot; These piles of water , the birds of the <unk> , the birds of the <unk> , the birds of the <unk> , were always <unk> from the waste . &quot;
it &apos;s hard to find more harmful than this vicious personality that Charles Darwin said .
you know , Darwin went back to England and changed his view , and I &apos;m going to tell you why .
and Walt Whitman was also showed -- sort of like the <unk> dog , <unk> , into <unk> , dumb animations .
and lately , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to the news of Kenya -- Kenyan <unk> and <unk> were blessed by Kenyan <unk> and <unk> , but I want to marry it .
I want to question it . you know why ?
because legislators can &apos;t keep clean from the natural environment .
you can &apos;t stop transmission of disease .
almost no one &apos;s been following a day .
they were very far away .
and that one of my favorites was much better than the legislators .
there &apos;s <unk> in the world .
the New York Times is mostly growing in the Americas , like the Americas and Venezuela , and in other continents , there are 16 species of <unk> , and they have the same risk of extinction among them .
so why is this so important ? first of all , <unk> has made a vital role for the ecology of the ecological cycle . they &apos;re not getting along .
the first one is our natural waste .
they &apos;re going to eat the meat of the body as well .
they can eliminate all of the bacteria on the body , and they can absorb the transmission and transmission of the virus to prevent the spread of the virus and the animals far from death and disease .
recent studies have shown that in parts of the body , the <unk> of the body , three to four times the time , the spread of disease and spread more opportunities .
there &apos;s a lot of historical significance as well .
they were closely related to the ancient Egypt .
the great cultural emblem of <unk> in ancient Egypt represents the <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> of Egypt , the unity and unity of Egypt and Egypt in Egypt and Egypt in Egypt .
in the mythology of the Hindu mythology , the god of <unk> <unk> <unk> , who took his life out of the 10 Devil in the head of the Devil <unk> .
and in Tibet , the <unk> and the <unk> are particularly important in places like Tibet , where there are no conditions , there are no timber , so the <unk> have provided a natural processing system for the locals .
so what &apos;s the problem with all of this ?
Kenya grows with eight <unk> , and six of them are dying .
many of the reasons why they &apos;re called <unk> , which is because in Kenya , human and wildlife fought in Kenya , <unk> people use poison to deal with animals , and then animals became the next victim .
in South Asia , there are countries like India and Pakistan , four of which have become critically endangered , which means that within 10 to 15 years or 15 years , the cause of mass extinctions due to the fact that <unk> have been fed by genetically engineered <unk> made of <unk> acid , commonly fed by genetically engineered <unk> .
now there &apos;s been a ban on <unk> acid in India , and the government of India has shown a positive attitude .
because of the number of wild dogs , the wild dogs , were <unk> around the body , and in the wild , like a ticking time bomb , there was an amazing increase in population in India .
Kenya is going to have the largest wind power plant in Africa : wind turbines are going to be installed in <unk> .
I &apos;m not against the wind , but we should ask the government to rethink that decision , because wind fires are going to threat the birds at high speed and adding them in half .
they &apos;re just birds .
in West Africa , some people have no sense of the flavor of the <unk> of the dead to meet the needs of <unk> and <unk> .
what are we doing ? we &apos;re working on these <unk> , and we &apos;re putting <unk> on them .
we &apos;re trying to figure out what the relationship is about the environment , and how we know the difference .
we discovered that they travel between different countries , so if you just look at an area , it &apos;s hard to make progress .
we need to deal with government governments throughout the area .
we &apos;re trying to communicate with local residents .
we &apos;re trying to get them to the benefits of good bugs , and to appreciate the amazing creatures and their contribution to nature .
what can you do ? you can do something , make an <unk> . you can write your government and tell them , we need to focus on the bugs that are being <unk> , and just take a moment to tell the people around you as many as possible .
when you come out of this room , you &apos;re <unk> , not only to tell your family , but to tell your neighbor the story about <unk> .
and they were so elegant . Charles Darwin once said that he had changed his own way , and he saw that <unk> were in the air , and then gradually coming back .
Kenya , all around the world , will lose a lot of losses if it loses these wondrous creatures .
thank you very much .
the people around us can help us make life a better life .
we don &apos;t necessarily always meet our neighbors , so even though we live in the same public space , the wisdom of neighbors is not transmitted .
so in the last few years , I &apos;ve been trying to give a bunch of stickers and pieces of chalk and these simple tools to share more in public spaces and neighbors .
all of these projects came from some of my own questions , like , how much did my neighbor rent ?
how are we going to be able to take something from the neighborhood and avoid <unk> the door of the door ?
how can we share our own memories of being destroyed and better understanding the land that we live in ?
how do we express our expectations of the snow that we saw that would reflect our communities of what we need and dream of today ?
I live in New Orleans and fell in love with this city .
the great tar sands have been <unk> my soul for hundreds of years , couple of hundred million years , and the great <unk> and the great cities that people have always believed to be a city full of music .
I felt a New Orleans when someone was thinking of well @-@ attended .
New Orleans had the most beautiful buildings in the world , but at the same time , she was the most abandoned city in America .
and I live near this house , and I want to tell you how to make it a better place in this community , and the other thing that changed my life completely .
in 2009 , I lost one of my loved ones .
her name was <unk> , and to me , she was just like my mother , and she died very suddenly , and no one had anticipated .
and then I thought a lot of things about death , and then -- -- -- -- -- it made me feel a bit of a deep part of my life , and the woman showed the real meaning of my life .
but I was hard to maintain this mentality in my daily life .
I felt that people were so easy to be trapped by day and day @-@ to @-@ day <unk> what really matters .
and so I made a big blackboard , and after some incredible help to get this abandoned building into a giant blackboard , and I put it on the same board , &quot; Before death , I thought ... &quot; So every one of these people could pick up a piece of chalk and share their life in a public and share their desire .
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , the entire wall was filled with and continued to add new answers .
I want to share with you some of the stuff that people have on the wall .
before I die , I want to take a trial for my release .
before I die , I want to across the pond . &quot;
before I die , I want to sing in front of a million audience . &quot;
before you die , there &apos;s a tree . &quot;
before I die , I think of a <unk> life . &quot;
before I die , I want to hold her again . &quot;
before I die , I wanted to be a dude . &quot;
before I die , I want to be completely true . &quot;
the original forgotten architecture had become a very constructive place where the hopes and dreams made me laugh and laughing and laughing and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and gave me comfort .
it makes us believe that we are not alone .
let &apos;s take a new paradigm of inspiration for our neighbors .
and this creates a space that we create , a space of reflection and thinking , and that tells us what is the most important thing in the process of changing .
this blackboard I &apos;ve done last year , and I &apos;ve been getting some passionate information from people saying that there &apos;s a wall in their community , and so I and my colleagues and I have a small toolbox , and this wall is all over the world , and Australia and so on .
and the signs are that if we have an opportunity to express our will and share it with others , then public spaces play a huge role .
the most precious two things we have , one , time and another , is the connection of another .
in this era of <unk> , trying to maintain the self , the clarity of life and life becomes more important than ever before .
we &apos;re always talking about death and dying and thinking about dying , but I realized that being one of the most powerful things that we can do .
thinking about dying can make you more conscious of your life .
public space can be much more about what it really matters to us , both for individuals , or for a community , to share our hopes , our fears and experiences , not only to help us create a better place , but to create a better life .
thank you .
thank you .
I was in a mines under 50 meters deep in Ghana .
the air is hot , filled with dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I could feel that the bones of the silent people disappeared from me , but I couldn &apos;t see anything else .
I heard voices around me , but more of them were silent rocks with <unk> tools .
like everybody else , I &apos;ve got a big <unk> on my head , and I &apos;ve got a beat truck tied to my neck , and I &apos;ve <unk> through the branches of the wall , and they &apos;re holding this meter @-@ long <unk> of the wall .
and my hand threw in , and immediately came to a miner who I met a miner who had fallen his hand and disappeared for a couple of days .
when I stand here today with you today , the miners who are still in mines like this , there &apos;s no paid , there &apos;s no pay , there &apos;s not a lot of money .
I finally climbed out of mines and got home to the miners that might never come home .
I &apos;ve spent the last 28 years photographing the <unk> of indigenous culture across six continents , and in 2009 , I was so privileged to be independent at the Vancouver summit of Vancouver in 2009 .
there &apos;s a lot of people there that I met , a lot of people that I met , a winners of the Free <unk> , an organization that focuses on causing the causes of modern society .
we talked about slavery , and this is where I really started to understand the reality of slavery , although I &apos;ve always known about the world of slavery , but I don &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s going on .
after our conversation ended , I felt horrible and failed to feel ashamed of this nasty phenomenon , I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
and the idea that made me die , and a few weeks later , I flew to the head of Los Angeles to see the Chief Justice of Police in Los Angeles and wanted to do something .
and that started my journey into contemporary art .
oddly enough , I &apos;ve been there .
some of them were my second home .
but this time , I was going to go and find the secret to the light that was never possible .
it &apos;s estimated that there are more than 27 million people around the world today .
this number is twice the number drawn from Africa &apos;s retail trade across the Atlantic slave trade .
150 years ago , an estimated business as three times as much as American business as a whole .
that &apos;s 50,000 dollars today .
but today , the cost of a whole family ship &apos;s generation is perhaps 18 dollars worth of property .
and what was striking was that the revenue of the global commons was over 130 billion dollars a year .
a lot of them were fake , and a lot of them were kind of <unk> , a kind of education , a great opportunity , a good job , for free to work with violence , without getting away .
today slavery is about the product of commercial products , but the people who create value are immediate conditions .
it exists almost every corner of the world , even though it is illegal everywhere .
in India and Nepal , I was brought in to <unk> .
it was a very weird sight there , like going into the <unk> or the <unk> of hell .
men , men , women , children , in the heat of 50 tons of dust , in fact , that whole family is packed with bricks and putting bricks on their heads up and down 18 blocks to a couple hundred meters away .
stripped and tired of them hanging them aside , sitting in silence , over and over again , the same day 16 to 17 hours a day .
not to take a break , not to eat , because of the extreme water , they basically don &apos;t need a toilet .
and because of the <unk> and the dust in it , my camera was so hot that it wasn &apos;t working .
every 20 minutes , I had to go back to the automobile and clean my equipment and make it <unk> at the end of the air conditioning , so it would give me a pause on the vehicle , and even the camera was treated better than those living people .
and I went back to <unk> , and I wanted to cry , but the <unk> quickly came to me and he said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t cry here . &quot;
and then he explained to me that in this place , the emotion of himself was very dangerous , not only for me , but for the workers .
I couldn &apos;t give them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money . I couldn &apos;t give them anything .
I &apos;m not the citizens of that country .
my behavior might make them worse than now .
I was expecting only the Free <unk> to be able to work within the system , so I believe they can .
and for me , I had to wait for the family to taste that painful .
and in the meantime , I saw a kid in the Himalayas , with rocks and miles and miles of waiting for trucks .
the kids that got bigger than the plates , the kids got bigger than the plates , the clothes that got beat up to themselves .
it &apos;s a very painful experience to see a scene like this .
how can we intervene in these hidden arguments , but are the ingredients that are universal ?
some people don &apos;t even think that they &apos;re on a daily basis for a day of slavery , and that &apos;s because they were born there .
no comparison .
if these people were to fight for their people , they lit up all their houses .
these people were <unk> , and they wanted to give up , but the woman in the middle stayed up in the local <unk> trying to get the <unk> of the quarries that they were trying to get the same <unk> , but now they are doing it for themselves , where they have free money .
and the tourist exchange is the most common thing we &apos;ve ever heard of as slavery , because all around the world I &apos;ve been warning about , if I keep on taking pictures of the industry , it &apos;s going to be very difficult for them .
I was struck by a couple of women who had been there .
and they took me down the narrow staircase into a filthy basement .
this is not a <unk> .
it &apos;s more like a restaurant .
the balconies were known to be used to be used in restaurants where the balconies were used .
in little cubicle , sexuality women and children are only seven years old enough to please their customers and to spend more food and wine .
each chamber has a very dirty darkness , and the numbers are drawn from the number of curtains and curtains .
people who work here tend to suffer from the cruel sexual abuse of their guests .
remember , I was standing almost in the dark , and I was instantly frightened of the moments of fear that I was trying to get stuck in this hell .
there &apos;s only an exit : it &apos;s the staircase .
there &apos;s no answered .
there &apos;s no window .
these people were completely unable to escape , and when we were dealing with such difficult topics , it &apos;s important to know about slavery , including the <unk> trade in our backyard .
there are thousands of restaurants , and there are not many of them .
recently , the New York Times covered the United States , where 100,000 to 300,000 children a year are bought and sold as <unk> .
and these things happen to us , and we just don &apos;t know .
and that &apos;s when we hear about slavery .
I visited a village <unk> in India .
this is the portrait of a family . &quot;
the ones that were <unk> , the father , the blue and the red hand belongs to two sons .
they stir it in a blend of it , and then they dip the silk into it , until the Post @-@ it notes are toxic .
and the translator tells me their stories .
we don &apos;t have freedom . they say .
but we still hope , and God can come out of this room and go somewhere else , and get paid .
it &apos;s been estimated that more than 4,000 children in an <unk> lake is the largest <unk> in the world .
we were there once or there , and I went to see this .
I see it as a whole family fishing on the boat , two brothers and a few little dots , kind of like ?
wrong ! they &apos;re all slaves .
the kids are getting sold out of their homes ; they &apos;re buying them ; they &apos;re not even swimming .
this boy is eight years old .
and as we got closer to the ship , he was shaking on the canoe of our canoe .
he was scared to fall in the water .
and the branches of the trees are often packed in the net , and the kids who are tired of getting thrown in the water to check the net .
a lot of people are drowning .
since he got started , he was forced to work in a <unk> .
he was very afraid of the master , and he didn &apos;t run away because he was treated as a child , and he was treated in the same way as his little slavery .
I saw these boys at 5 in the morning working at the end of the net , and they started working in one o &apos;clock in the morning .
and it was so cold , and it was so cold .
you know that the net weight when it &apos;s full of fish is full of fish !
I want to introduce you to the <unk> .
he had come out of a fishing village where he had been since .
he saw him in a homeless asylum , a place for <unk> victims .
he was in a photograph , and he was in a shower , and the good news is that right now , the more <unk> he and the family are with his family , one of them is able to make a living for a living and make sure that the child is secure .
and there &apos;s a possibility in that .
it &apos;s because somebody shows a stand , and it affects his future .
driving in Ghana a way along with the <unk> in Ghana , with the partners of the <unk> on the <unk> , which suddenly <unk> our cars and hits our window .
he asked us to take a <unk> and change it to the bush .
at the end of the road , he urged us to get out of the car .
and then he pointed to a series of different footprints on the floor , and he said , &quot; Here , walk ! &quot;
we &apos;d made sure that the sunlight from the far west of about an hour was recently buried in rain , and I would take the equipment and I would go up and I would add it up to the wild waters of the chest , and continue to walk out of the chest .
and after two hours of <unk> , we had a big empty space in front of us , and every one of them had a big home , and every one of them had slaves .
a lot of women are still carrying their own little child , walking in a cow surrounded by mercury .
mercury is used to extract gold .
these people were slavery in another mine in Ghana .
and when they got out of mines , they were full of water .
and I remember that they &apos;re full of tired eyes , and a lot of them have been working for 72 hours .
these rocks are about 90 feet deep , and they &apos;re packed with bags full of rocks to be transported to another area in which the gold is <unk> .
and as a result , the men that landed and were robust , and we found some people in the edges and disabled , and some children .
they were victims of violent victims .
in fact , these robust men are likely to be equivalent to this man , many years later , being <unk> and tuberculosis .
this is <unk> . when his father died , his uncle sold him to the mining that he was working on .
in his uncle &apos;s death , the uncle has to carry on with his uncle &apos;s <unk> , and he has been compelled to continue the work of mining .
and I met him who had been working on a mining site for 14 years , and it was a disaster in an accident , and the doctors said , &quot; There &apos;s an amputation . &quot;
apart from this injury , he had tuberculosis , even though he had to work every day .
and even so , he had dreams of the freedom of the Free at the <unk> , and he had an incredible amount of suffering in the face of an incredible amount of suffering that happened to me .
I want us to give these people the slaves .
and as I was photographing , I took a lot of candles , I gave them the candle to my photograph , and I wanted to be able to light their stories and their difficulties , and as we were all safe , I took a series of photos .
they know these images will be seen from the outside .
and I want them to know that we &apos;re going to give them the testimony that we can make their lives change .
and I really believe that when we think of them as people , it &apos;s hard to tolerate the atrocities like slavery .
these images aren &apos;t topics , they &apos;re about people , and they &apos;re about people , as I am , deserve the same rights and dignity and dignity and respect and dignity and dignity and dignity and respect that you have in my life .
I didn &apos;t want these beautiful , but I was surrounded by people who I could meet .
and I want these images to be able to evoke a powerful power in the viewer &apos;s eye , and I hope that the force of that power can be the light of the <unk> of the <unk> , because without this light , this light will live in a shadow .
thank you .
speaking , I &apos;m an application of mathematics , and for everyone who studies math , there &apos;s a special problem that we have with management consultant is like we and management consultant .
nobody knows what we &apos;re doing .
so I &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we &apos;re doing today .
well , dance is one of many human activities .
we felt as though the <unk> and the <unk> dancer , you will know later .
now ballet need phenomenal scholarship and great expertise and even some level of <unk> .
but sadly , the nervous system , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease , has broken down this extraordinary ability to happen to my friend <unk> , who used to be the great <unk> of his time .
he had a lot of therapy for years and a lot of progress .
and yet , there are <unk> million people in the world that have this disease , and they have to endure , <unk> , <unk> and so on with symptoms of other symptoms , so we need objective tools to test them even before they were <unk> .
we need objective measurements , and in the end , we want to know when the only way to cure a disease is when we have the objective facts that answer those questions accurately .
but it &apos;s so annoying when you get Parkinson &apos;s and every other <unk> disease , there &apos;s no <unk> , so you can &apos;t do simple blood tests , and the best thing we can do is , like this 20 @-@ minute neurological test test .
you have to get clinics , and it costs a lot of money , which means no one has ever done this before , never done this test before .
but what if the patient could do it at home ?
is this the distance that the patient gave to the clinic , and what if the patient could do it alone ?
it doesn &apos;t take a lot of money to hire staff .
by the way , if you go to a neurologist , this costs about 300 dollars .
so I want to ask you an unusual approach , an approach that we can try to achieve , because you know , at least we &apos;re all like my friend <unk> .
I &apos;ve got a video about <unk> <unk> .
this is a healthy state where someone is speaking , and we think of ourselves as the voice of sound , because when we make these sounds , we really have to deal with these <unk> , which are born with , say , <unk> genes .
and like ballet , it takes special training .
think about it . how long would it take for a child ?
from the sound , we can follow the positions of <unk> , just as Parkinson &apos;s , and it can affect us all the time .
you can see that the <unk> on the bottom are a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
we saw the same symptoms .
voices <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
speech will become <unk> , and then it has more <unk> , and these are examples of symptoms .
in fact , this sound is a lot of the time , but as long as you have a digital mic on a bunch of <unk> of sound analysis , the software is now available in the latest available machines , and now we can see exactly where other people are healthy and disease in the straight lines just require a signal .
so what do they do with speech @-@ based testing , and what are they going to do with specialized clinical trials , and they &apos;re all technological .
the neurological testing is <unk> , and they use existing infrastructure .
you don &apos;t need to design a new set of hospitals to test it .
they &apos;re all <unk> . although that &apos;s all based on speech tests , they &apos;re not experts at all .
that means you can do it yourself .
and it &apos;s going fast , and it &apos;s about 30 seconds .
prices are low . we also know how to do it .
once it &apos;s released , it can be scaled at large scale .
I &apos;ve got some of the great goals out here .
we can reduce the number of questions with the patient .
there &apos;s no need to go to the clinic and do routine tests .
we can monitor objective data ever more often .
we can organize a bunch of trials , very low , and we can show the size of the population in the first time .
we also had the opportunity to start looking for this disease , early @-@ life organisms in the first place .
so , the first step from here today , we started <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
working with <unk> and <unk> , we &apos;d like to record enough data from all over the world to get those four goals together .
our <unk> number connected seven million calls on Earth .
anyone with a healthy or a Parkinson &apos;s disease can come in , it &apos;s cheap , it &apos;s cheap to keep a record , and every time I get a little bit of money , I &apos;m glad to announce we &apos;ve only got six percent goal eight hours .
thank you .
Max , based on these samples , can you tell who is healthy , who &apos;s the disease ?
what do you want to take from these specimens ?
yes , yes . so this is what you call a call , and you have to tell us if you have this disease . <unk> : mmm .
you know , some people might not be calling us , or connected to us .
but we still get a lot of samples from different environments , and the point is different environments , because then we can eliminate the causes of all of these mix factors that are meaningful to actually label this disease .
so you &apos;ve got about 86 percent accuracy right now ?
it &apos;s more than that .
as a matter of fact , my student posed him earlier , because he made some fabulous results , and now he proved that the mobile phone can be done online , so we &apos;re approaching 99 percent accuracy right now .
okay , that &apos;s pretty cool .
so that meant that people could -- people could use their phones to call on your phone and then do the test and test the phone , and then record the voice , and then their doctor can check what they &apos;re doing in the stages of that disease .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much , Max and all .
thank you .
I &apos;ve always been fascinated by photography since I &apos;ve been on enough cameras since I &apos;ve been working with you , but I &apos;d like to share with you the 15 pictures that I love most , they don &apos;t have a photograph I ever made .
there &apos;s no artistic director , there &apos;s no silver bullet , but don &apos;t forget it .
in fact , most of them were made from random visitors .
my story is based on one of my first <unk> speech in New York City , and my wife took a picture , and I was on her daughter &apos;s first birthday , and we stood on the <unk> Street and 15th .
and about a year later , we went back to New York City , so we decided to take the same photograph .
you can guess what happened .
and as the daughter was three years old , the wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you ever want to come back to New York , do you want to continue this little tradition ? &quot;
and it was taken from the viewer that started our journey .
you know , taking the camera and hands it to a total stranger is common and unusual .
no one &apos;s going to refuse , and luckily no one &apos;s holding our cameras out .
and we didn &apos;t know that it would change our lives .
it becomes sacred to us .
this was taken just a few weeks after 9 / 11 , and I was trying to explain what was happening on September 11th , trying to get this five @-@ year @-@ olds understand .
so these pictures are not only recorded a moment , or a special journey .
they &apos;re the way we remember the week of the month , the week of the month , and how we changed year after year and years , not just the changes of the body , but the changes in the body .
because I took the same picture every year , and our eyes were different , and the daughter came to a new milestone , and I looked at her eyes through her eyes and saw how she reacted , how she saw everything .
this is the time we spent playing with , and it &apos;s the most anticipated time in a year .
and recently , we walked along the way , and she suddenly stopped , and she pointed to the red <unk> on a store , and she said she loved her house , and that &apos;s where we were .
she told me she was five years old , and she was standing on that photograph .
she said she remembered the first time she saw her heart emerging , it was nine years ago .
now she went to New York on college campus , because she decided to go to New York .
and I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is our memories .
so I want to share this active and well @-@ conscious idea of creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but I personally , I &apos;m personally , I don &apos;t always get stuck in family photographs .
I always took the photo .
and I hope to encourage all of you here , to go to the photo , to not get involved , to go to the front , &quot; can you take a picture ? &quot;
thank you .
