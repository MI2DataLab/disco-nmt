one day , the Los Angeles Times , Steve <unk> , was listening to a wonderful piece of music in Los Angeles .
music is a man , an African @-@ American man , a very glamorous man , two strings of preserved with only one .
now , I &apos;m going to tell you about this story , and many of you already know that because Steve &apos;s column turned out to be the basis of a book , and then Robert <unk> , who happened to be the founder of Nathaniel <unk> , who was also the double <unk> for his career as a result of <unk> .
Nathaniel <unk> from the Juilliard School , who was completely destroyed 30 years later , and he suffered homeless on the streets of Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to look at Steve &apos;s book , or look at movies , not just to understand the beauty of these two men , but to see that music is the most powerful tool to create this kind of ties , and that was the most powerful tool that would change Nathaniel &apos;s life .
I met Mr. Rogers in 2008 , in 2008 , two years ago in Walt Disney Hall .
he listened to Beethoven &apos;s first , and the orchestra came to himself .
he was talking about pleasure , <unk> , of course , of the <unk> and Hillary Clinton , probably not going to be in the World Series , because of the Beethoven &apos;s Ninth Symphony that began the performance of the four @-@ core <unk> .
we talked a little bit about music . a few days later , I got this email from Steve saying that I was interested in the violin .
what I should mention was that Nathaniel refused to be treated , because what he was given was an electrical and handcuffs in his life forever .
and as a result , his schizophrenia now became more likely to have an encounter , and the worst thing that he had , he would have disappeared for days on the streets of Skid Row , of fear , of suffering from the psyche .
Nathaniel was a state in which we started with the Disney Hall Nation , and he was <unk> in his eyes with a lost direction .
he mentioned the invisible devil and the smoke , and how someone could sleep when he was asleep to sleep .
I felt frightened of not being safe for myself , but fear that I was going to lose him , and I was going to immerse myself in one of his states , and I would destroy his relationship with the violin , and if I started talking about the musical scale and the other forms of music .
so I started <unk> .
I played Beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
when I was playing , I knew there was something going on in Nathaniel &apos;s eye .
it &apos;s as if he grabs something completely invisible to it as if it &apos;s chemistry , and it &apos;s the catalyst for it .
his voice is : anger is transformed into understanding , curiosity , elegance .
and the magic is , he picks up his violin , and he starts playing with some of the pieces of <unk> , and then he &apos;s going to do it again , <unk> .
so we started talking about music : from Bach to Beethoven , <unk> , all of the names started with B.
and I realized that he wasn &apos;t just a piece of music , but he was able to connect the music with him .
he talked about the things that were filled with passion and understanding of music , as though I was talking to other colleagues in Los Angeles .
by playing music , talking about music , this guy , who was from a <unk> , really stuck , on the streets of Los Angeles , became a charming musician , wonderful music music music music music .
music is medicine . music is transforming us .
music , for the deaf , is about helping him to open up .
because music can help him turn his mind into something reality .
and that &apos;s what helped him out of his suffering .
and I know that &apos;s what art looks like .
and that &apos;s the reason why we create music , that we use every one of us has an underlying core of ourselves , our emotions , our experiences , our art , and our creativity , to shape our reality .
and that real expression of reality is bringing us to all of us , to inspire us , to engage us .
and he took him back to a group of friends .
the power of the music is bringing him back to the whole family of music , where people understand his talents .
and I would always create music for him , whether it &apos;s on the streets of Walt Disney or on the Hudson Hill , because he suggested to me why I was a musician .
thank you .
LP : thank you . thank you .
Robert Full .
Robert Full : now I &apos;m going to play a piece of music that I &apos;ve learned from <unk> .
so please forgive me .
I had a lot of fish in my life .
only two were my favorites .
the first one is passion .
it &apos;s a beautiful fish , a <unk> , a texture , a <unk> , the most popular fish on the menu .
what a beautiful fish !
and even better yet , it &apos;s the highest standard raise , the goal of keeping it sustainable .
and the people who sold him were pretty sick .
I &apos;d been spending a couple of months on this beautiful relationship .
and one day the top of this company called me and invited me to join a campaign and sustainable development of fisheries .
and I said , &quot; Yes , certainly not . &quot;
this company is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in our chef : how do we put fish on the menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing from all over the ocean like frozen trees .
no , it &apos;s a disruptive .
ninety @-@ nine percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tunas , the tunas , the <unk> , they &apos;re all extinct .
almost nothing left .
so , whether it &apos;s good or bad or evil , whether it &apos;s bad or not , it &apos;s going to be a part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of talk about this industry , and they &apos;re mostly about <unk> and effective , like tuna .
the feed of the tuna is 15 .
what that means is , every single one pound of tuna meat costs 15 pounds of feed on other wild fish .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
and it &apos;s not delicious .
and finally , this company wanted to do something right .
I want to support them .
the day before that event , I was contacted by the PR office workers .
let &apos;s call him a <unk> for four reasons .
I said , &quot; Don Burke , which I know is true , is that you &apos;re famous in the ocean @-@ basin @-@ wide fish , and you don &apos;t get pollution . &quot;
and he responded to this : exactly what you &apos;re talking about . we &apos;re doing a lot of this stuff , and we &apos;re all releasing this stuff , and we &apos;re not going to keep it anywhere .
and then he <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be the <unk> .
the feed of cattle ? two and a half , and he says .
the best in the sports industry .
two and a half , that &apos;s good .
what &apos;s two and a half ? what are you looking for ?
and he said , &quot; <unk> for <unk> . &quot;
I said , &quot; Look , the phone &apos;s good . and then the phone comes off . &quot;
and as a result , I was lying in bed and wondering , what is the hell of a living protein ?
so the next day , just before that incident , I called clear Don guns .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t tell you , for example , have some examples of sustainability ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would go and ask people around .
and then I got some phone calls from this company , but none of them gave me a clear answer , until finally , they &apos;re experts in biology .
let me tell you , give him a round of 700 feet .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t fight for a male or two , can you use it for a second or two ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he mentioned the following .
and I asked the question : what about <unk> ?
he said , &quot; <unk> are , feathers , <unk> , bones , waste , dry and dry and dry their feed . &quot;
I said , what &apos;s the proportion of the chicken in the feed ?
think about it , you know , two percent .
and he said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t clear clear clear clear Don &apos;t , for example , do this kind of thing , this kind of thing ? &quot;
the phone was quiet there for a long time , and he said to me , &quot; The chicken is so much chicken . &quot;
so I no longer love this fish .
no , not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous , self @-@ sufficiency .
and I am .
no , I no longer love this fish anymore , because I swear to God that after that dialogue , it was more like a chicken .
the second one is a different kind of love .
it &apos;s a romantic , and the more you know your fish , the more you love it .
the first time I was eating this fish in a restaurant , in southern Spain .
a long time ago , a journalist and I said this .
she could say it was a <unk> .
that fish is lighting up on the table , with the light , the white one .
chef cooked time .
it was like cooking twice .
but it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s delicious .
who could do this kind of good , and could they do it in cooking time ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him <unk> . his name is <unk> .
but he didn &apos;t cook that fish . he wasn &apos;t a chef , at least in the way you understand it .
he was a biologist at the <unk> Valley .
he &apos;s a <unk> in Spain .
he was in the <unk> River .
and it wasn &apos;t until the late 1980s that this was the basis of the <unk> of our species .
they were there at that time , and this was basically wetlands .
and they pull out the water .
and then they built a series of complex canals , and they put the water in there .
but they didn &apos;t succeed , I mean economics .
and there &apos;s a tremendous amount of catastrophe around the environment .
almost 90 percent of all the birds around the world are gone , and in this area there are a lot of birds .
and then in 1982 , a Spanish company that was buying this piece .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow .
they &apos;re basically <unk> .
instead of using <unk> , they used <unk> to bring water .
they filled it with water .
and then there was a groundbreaking fishery -- the <unk> , the <unk> , the shrimp , the <unk> -- in this project , <unk> , and this company , saved the whole thing .
and it was phenomenal .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
and I looked at the horizon as a kind of vast , and it brought you into the view , and it was filled with the channel of water and the wetlands of this magnificent <unk> .
not too long ago , I was there with <unk> .
he &apos;s a remarkable man . he &apos;s a Darwinian , a quarter of a crocodile .
we went to the wetlands , and I was <unk> , and I was <unk> and <unk> were able to tell the <unk> about my knees and the <unk> .
and here , he &apos;s pointing to a rare , dark shoulder <unk> .
this is what he referred to as the breed of minerals .
and this one , he saw a series of patterns that allow people to stick in Tanzania .
as a result , <unk> had spent a lot of time working in African National Park .
I asked him how he became a fish expert .
he said , &quot; fish ? I don &apos;t know them .
I &apos;m just an expert on <unk> .
and then he started talking about rare birds and algae and different <unk> .
don &apos;t get me wrong , and that conversation really is about some kind of thing , about <unk> .
it was great , but I was in love .
there was always a <unk> in my mind that I would like to taste delicious fish .
so I quit him . I said , &quot; <unk> , what makes your fish sweet ? &quot;
he pointed to the algae .
and I knew that the brothers , the algae , the plankton , the genetic material , all of these things .
but what do you eat ?
what &apos;s the feed of cattle ? the <unk> ?
and then he continued to tell me that this was a very productive system , and what these fish were eating in the wild .
plant @-@ organisms , phytoplankton , plankton , plankton , species of fish .
it &apos;s a very healthy system . it &apos;s self @-@ update .
no feed .
have you heard about a farm that doesn &apos;t feed animals ?
later on that day , I was driving around with my wife and I asked him , &quot; How do you measure success ? &quot;
and it was then , as if there was a film director suddenly asking for change .
we turn around and see the most beautiful image , hundreds of thousands of pink <unk> , which is a pink carpet .
he said , &quot; That &apos;s success . &quot;
look at their belly , their pink .
they &apos;re enjoying their <unk> .
dinner ? I was completely degraded .
I said , &quot; Your <unk> , wouldn &apos;t their <unk> be your fish ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; He said .
birds eat 20 percent of our fish and fish .
and last year , this fishery , which has <unk> , has over 250 different species .
today , this has become one of the largest and most important predators in Europe .
and I said , &quot; OK , that &apos;s not the number of birds , that don &apos;t want to be the most <unk> ? &quot;
no , he didn &apos;t .
he said , &quot; Let &apos;s invest in general , not deliberate . &quot;
this is an ecological network .
and these <unk> eaten the shrimp .
shrimp eat <unk> .
so the more their stomach was bright , the more it was , the better it was .
okay , so let &apos;s take a look at this . a farm does not feed the animals , and it estimates its success , it depends on its natural enemies .
a fishery , also a bird shelter .
and by the way , those <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t be there .
they reproduce in the city , and it &apos;s 150 miles away , and the soil is much more potent .
every morning , they fly 150 miles to this camp .
and at night , they were flying 150 miles .
they did this because they could follow a white line on the freeway .
not kidding .
I &apos;ve been thinking about things like &quot; The <unk> <unk> &quot; in my mind , and I &apos;m looking at <unk> .
I said , Lewis <unk> , they fly 150 miles to get the logging , and they fly 150 miles at night ?
do they do it for kids ?
and he looked at me like I had just quoted in Houston .
and he said , &quot; Don &apos;t do it . they do it because it &apos;s better . &quot;
I haven &apos;t talked about the skin of my favorite fish , which is really delicious , and I don &apos;t usually like <unk> . I don &apos;t like <unk> .
it has <unk> , like tar @-@ like .
I never did it with the fish .
but when I was in the southern part of Spain , it didn &apos;t taste like a <unk> .
it tasted soft , and it was like you had a dry taste of the nature of the ocean .
and I talked to him about my idea , and he was frowning .
he said , &quot; It &apos;s like a sponge . &quot;
it &apos;s the final line that prevents anything from getting into the body .
the effect of it is to absorb heat .
and then he went on and said , &quot; But we don &apos;t have any water . &quot;
okay . a <unk> does not feed its fish . a fishery measuring its success is due to its natural enemies .
and then I realized that when he said that there was no <unk> , he didn &apos;t have any dry water , because water flowing through this fisheries was from tall <unk> .
that river contains all of the stuff that &apos;s in the river right now , chemical pollutants , left .
and when it gets to the system , the water gets warmer than it does .
it &apos;s a very dry system that can filter water from here .
so this fishery , this fishery , is not just for animals , it &apos;s not just about measuring its success , it &apos;s based on its natural habitat , but it &apos;s a <unk> , and it &apos;s not just for you and me .
because when water leaves here , it runs into the Atlantic .
I know it &apos;s a very small role , but I &apos;m very concerned about it , and you should be , because it &apos;s a love story , it &apos;s not just romance , it &apos;s education .
you might say it &apos;s the future food diet , whether we &apos;re talking about beef or beef .
what we need now is a whole new conception of agriculture , a real food .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s extreme .
we &apos;re not a realist . we &apos;re a <unk> .
we love the market . we love small intensive farms . we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
and then when you suggest that this food is going to ensure the future of the future , someone stands up and says , &quot; My brother , I love the pink , but how do you make the world fill ?
how do you feed the world ? &quot;
can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like your problem .
no , it &apos;s not just because we &apos;ve grown far more calories than we need in the world .
today , one billion people are still living in multi @-@ billion .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- the root of the whole thing is not to balance it .
and the real reason I don &apos;t like this is because he put up an logic of a food system , a logic that existed in the last 50 years .
bring it to the soil , bring it to the retail plant , give it to the soil , give it to the soil , and then agriculture can simply ask , what if we feed more people , what &apos;s wrong with it ?
that &apos;s an incentive . it has become reasonable , and it &apos;s a business plan for American agriculture .
we should point out that its true , an ecological capital that was <unk> for the <unk> , a rapidly occurring business that made it possible .
it &apos;s not a business . it &apos;s not a agriculture .
today , our food is under threat , not because of the supply that &apos;s currently being sold , but because of the resources available .
it wasn &apos;t invented by a latest <unk> technology and a tractor version , but it was fertile soil , not by pump water , but by fresh water , not by <unk> , by the forest , not by fishing and shipping nets , but by the fish in the ocean .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how do we feed ourselves ?
or better yet , how do we create an environment where it can feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t expect the future of agriculture models .
it &apos;s obsolete , and it &apos;s tired .
because it &apos;s dependent on capital , chemistry , mechanical , and it &apos;s not really good food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s been around for two billion years and a half billion years .
look at farmers like <unk> .
it &apos;s not just their own farm , it &apos;s self @-@ sufficiency , it &apos;s not about consumption , it &apos;s not about the farm , it &apos;s not just about the farm , it &apos;s about the farmer .
because they &apos;re also experts in tastes .
and if I want to be honest , they &apos;re better than I am .
you know , I completely agree with this , because if the future of good food is so good , they would be delicious .
thank you .
and if I want to leave you with one idea today that all of the data that we consume has a lot more information than the sum of the parts , which is that all of the data that we consume in our lifetime is greater than the sum of all of the data that we consume , I want to think about it .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart of the ages .
the tool I use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and I can use filter and filter it for a particular cause , like an accident .
immediately , I saw a different model .
and that &apos;s because people are here in the middle , when they &apos;re most active , and they &apos;re also the ones where they &apos;re most prolific .
we can <unk> data on death , and we can see that recycling patterns and cancer are the major conditions for death , but it &apos;s not true for everyone .
if we filter through the age of 40 , for example , we can see that the emergency room is going to be very careful .
and if you go further , it turns out that this one is particularly true for men .
well , you probably understand that this tool has a lot to do with it , and the data is very much like a living material .
if we can do this with our data , why don &apos;t we do it on the content ?
so we &apos;re showing here every single issue that has ever been done in sports .
all over here , it &apos;s all on the Web .
you can go back to your room after I finished .
you can look at it in 10 years .
you were able to specific a year .
you can go directly into one issue .
I saw this ; I saw ex @-@ probation <unk> .
I &apos;m a fan of Lance Armstrong , so I &apos;m going to click on it , and I &apos;m just going to show you all of that .
now , if I just wanted to sample these numbers , I would think , well , what about all bike athletes ?
so I can take a step back and scale this up .
I saw Greg <unk> .
so you have to understand that when you look at information in this way , open , <unk> , backwards , you &apos;re not search , you &apos;re not browsing .
what you do is actually slightly different .
and in between , and we think this changes the way information is used .
so I came up with something a little bit crazy about this idea .
so what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve just plucked the Wikipedia page and then compress it down to a little <unk> .
and the quote contains one of the genetic information that comes from the field of expertise .
I &apos;m just showing you 500 of the most popular Wikipedia pages here .
but even in these brief observations , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we knew what was the most popular thing in Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to continue and choose the government .
now , after chosen government , I can see the most frequent <unk> of all in Wikipedia , the Time magazine .
and that &apos;s important , because this is not a content of any <unk> site .
only if you step back and look at the big picture , you can see it .
let &apos;s look at one of these special <unk> , and then I can dive into the magazine spending time .
so , if you look at these guys , I can see that most of them come from the government . some of them come from the world of science .
and what &apos;s interesting is that the <unk> are also the great TED Prize .
so we can continue , and look at all the grand prize winners .
so as you can see , this is the first time we &apos;re running through the network , it &apos;s actually a page , not just a page , but a net @-@ page net on a much higher level .
so I want to tell you another thing that might surprise you .
I &apos;m just showing you the New York Times website .
<unk> , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it the browser , but it &apos;s actually a browser , where you can browse the pages -- and we can introduce each page like this , and we can actually pull out the technologies like this , and we can bring it back to every website like this .
so I could step back and get back to a place .
and the reason why this is important is because , in this way , I can look at all of my history through this medium .
so I was able to go deep in time .
here , actually , this is what I just showed you .
I could sort of <unk> what I saw earlier today .
if I want to step back and look at everything , I can cut my history out , maybe my search history , and here , I did some search @-@ and @-@ searching search , and there &apos;s a little bit of <unk> around here .
and from this , I could go into the Web and just talk to them .
this is the same information , because the different goals are used multiple times , rearrange the whole of it , <unk> it more information , <unk> it , <unk> it to the whole thing .
now , in the world , we talk about data often about this curse .
we talked about the explosion of information .
we &apos;re talking about flooding in the ocean .
suppose we can turn this idea around and reverse it , and compare it to the links , and let &apos;s start to get used to this diversity of information , and then see if we can &apos;t see it in any way , hidden patterns , and see the patterns that we can &apos;t see in this way , hide ?
if we can do that , instead of just being stuck in the data , we can actually get access to information .
and not only processing information , but we can also tease out knowledge .
if we get knowledge , we can even find intelligence .
thank you .
I grew up with science fiction .
in high school , I went back to school every day .
in the long @-@ term drive , I &apos;ve always been immersed in books , and that science fiction brought my ideas into other worlds , in narrative , in a way that I was very curious .
and besides that , I was also curious to see in other ways : whenever I don &apos;t need to go to class , I always go to the trees , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the snake , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the lab , the microscope .
I was like , you know , a <unk> scientific <unk> .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , about the possibilities .
and my love for science fiction was also reaction to the world around me , because at the end of the &apos; 60s , humans started to dive into the deep sea .
Jacques <unk> took his amazing visual effects and placed it into our lives , and showed us the animals , the landscape and the beautiful world .
all of this seems to resonate with science fiction .
at the same time , I was an artist .
I could paint .
and I also found that because there were no video games or special effects on film or film <unk> , I had to create these images in my head .
you know , when you &apos;re a kid , when you &apos;re a student , it &apos;s often the same thing that the author described in our brains .
and my response to that is to look at alien organisms , alien worlds , robots , spaceships and so on .
I was hiding the textbooks behind the textbook , and I was always covered with paint .
and as a result , I had to ask for other ways of creativity .
interestingly , the Jacques <unk> film made me wonder that there was an alien world on this Earth .
I may not be able to really go to the alien world in my lifetime . it sounds so annoying .
but there was a world that I could really go to -- the incredible abundance , with all the things that I had learned through books .
so the year I was 15 , I decided to become a divers .
the only problem was , I was living in a small village in Canada , and the sea was 600 miles away .
but I didn &apos;t do that .
I repeated my father again , until he found a dive in New York where I found a blade on the other side of the border .
so I got my diving certificate at the water pool in the swimming pool of Christianity .
but in the next two years , I met the sea , and we moved to California .
over the next 40 years , I spent approximately 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours in the submersible .
and I found in the deep sea -- even the shallow water -- filled with amazing life , far beyond our imagination .
the imagination of nature is far more than nature &apos;s imagination .
and it wasn &apos;t until today when I was diving , I was amazed .
I &apos;m passionate about the ocean , and I haven &apos;t changed .
but when I got bored , I picked up movies .
and it seemed to me that this was the best way to <unk> my storytelling and to create an imagery .
when I was a child , I always paint cartoons .
and the movie made exactly the same way to combine the imagery of the story , so it will happen naturally .
and of course , the stories I tell were stories of science fiction , &quot; The Terminator , &quot; &quot; &quot; The <unk> &quot; and &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; I combine my love of the deep sea and the movies .
combine those two passions , combine them .
and &quot; The <unk> &quot; brought another kind of perspective : in order to get better storytelling patterns , to create the fluid from the film , we started using computer animation .
the first soft people ever made in computers were also born .
and while that movie happened , it happened to be back , and I saw incredible images -- the magic of the global audiences all over the world .
and that &apos;s what Arthur C. Clarke found between technology and magic .
and what the audience saw was that magic .
it was so exciting to me .
and I thought , &quot; Oh my gosh , this technology needs to be done in the art of the movie . &quot;
so in my next movie , &quot; The Terminator 2 , &quot; we pushed this technology to the new stairs .
by working with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we created the liquid metal guy in the movie , and the success of the movie depends on whether this technology works .
and it worked . we made the magic again , and we got the same feedback from the audience , but the movie department was a little bit better .
and with that , we realized that this was going to be a completely new world for the musicians to come up with .
so I started a company with my best friend <unk> , and <unk> was the name of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the idea behind the company is to develop a simulation of the past , etc .
and we did , in fact , capture the same thing over time .
but in the mid @-@ 1990s , we found that even though the goal of companies had suffered in biology , in people design , we had a problem .
and so I created this work called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which are trying to push the images and the computer side effects to the limits of using computers to create real human emotions , and the main characters are made from computers .
but I touched the computer . the people in our company told me we couldn &apos;t do it .
so I took this idea and I put it in a large movie about my dive down .
I was talking to the film companies that this film was going to be the <unk> and <unk> of the boat , and it would be a beautiful , romantic film .
but my real motivation was to visit the pieces of the Titanic .
that &apos;s why I made that movie .
I mean , the truth is , but the movie company didn &apos;t know .
and I convinced them . I said , &quot; Look , we &apos;re going to dive in the field . &quot;
start with the film .
it &apos;s a vital and theater .
so I persuaded them to invest in an adventure .
it sounds crazy , but ultimately it &apos;s still about creating a reality if you use your imagination .
in fact , we did create a reality six months later -- I was at the North Atlantic edge of a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half miles underwater in a Russian submersible , which was looking at the Titanic .
not a movie , not a high @-@ definition , but a realization .
and that was pretty impressive .
the early days of the session were really bright , and we needed to build cameras , lighting , etc .
but what really struck me was that these deep dives , like the cosmic adventures .
both of them are high @-@ tech products , and both of them need critical deployment .
you walk in the dark , you walk into this dark environment , and if you don &apos;t rely on your own power , you &apos;re not potentially rescued by any rescue .
and I thought , &quot; Oh my gosh . I &apos;m like being in a science fiction movie . &quot;
that &apos;s pretty cool .
so the deep @-@ sea expedition became my new passion .
and of course , it comes down to this idea that , of course , curiosity and science . it &apos;s the creation of everything , the unknown , the unknown , the curiosity @-@ based , the imagination .
Hollywood couldn &apos;t give my experience .
even though I could imagine an organism , and use a computer special effect to create it , I couldn &apos;t imagine what I saw that day .
and in the course of our expedition , I looked at the animals that lived in the hydrothermal vents at the time , and sometimes I hadn &apos;t seen anything that I &apos;d never seen before , and sometimes it was something that no one had ever looked at before , even before we realized that we weren &apos;t recorded .
and as a result , I was <unk> all around , and I had to go on .
so I made this amazing decision .
after the &quot; Titanic &quot; became successful , I decided , &quot; All right , I &apos;m doing a film in Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to be a explorers for the rest of the time . &quot;
so we started working on these kinds of expeditions .
we went to <unk> , and we used robotic devices to detect the wreckage .
and we went back to the ruins of the Titanic .
and it created a bunch of robots that could contain optical fibers .
the goal is to go down into the wreckage and explore the inside of it -- an unprecedented act .
before , no one had ever looked at the periphery . they didn &apos;t need the technology , so we created that technique .
you know , I was on the deck of the Titanic , sitting in a submersible , looking like the deck of the ship , thinking of the band that was performed here .
I &apos;m manipulating a little robot that flies through the corridors .
even though I was in control , my mind was in the field of discovery .
I felt that I was really on the verge of the Titanic .
and that was the most incredible thing that I ever met with , because before the light of the lights around the robot , I knew everything that was hidden in every corner , because in the process of making films , I spent a lot of months in this scene .
and the actual model that came out of the studio is a real model made from this ship .
so the experience was extraordinary .
it allowed me to experience an experience of telepresence -- the physical form of robots that we even have , the body of our own ideas , into something else .
it &apos;s a profound feeling .
maybe this could give us a sense of what the world would be like for decades , as a science community , and I could imagine the future of human society , using half @-@ a @-@ half machine people to do exploration and other activities .
so through these adventures , I really started to really appreciate the beauty of the sea floor , such as the creatures living in the deep ocean , the creatures of the Earth .
they live in a chemical <unk> .
we don &apos;t need the sun that we depend on .
so when you look at the animals living at 500 degrees below the sea floor .
you think they can &apos;t survive .
and at the same time , I was also interested in the science of space technology , which was also influenced by the scientific fiction .
and as a result , I worked closely with the space community , working with the United States <unk> , and became part of the research director of the board , the actual space mission , to go to Russia , to go to Russia , to see the patent protocol of the astronauts , and so on , we took our 3D space station .
this experience is pretty impressive .
but what I ended up doing was trying to convince the space scientists to go underneath the ocean .
let them have a real experience . space biologists , <unk> , people who are interested in extreme environments where we take them to the deep ocean , to have them look , to see , to look , to take a look , to take a look , to see , to take a look , and so on .
so what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re studying the <unk> of science .
I &apos;ve connected the experience of being a child as a science community .
and I learned a lot about this journey .
I learned a lot about science , but I also learned a lot about leadership .
you felt that the director had to be a leader , a leader , a leadership , a <unk> .
but before these trips , I knew nothing about leaders .
because I &apos;m going to ask myself , what am I doing ?
why do I do this ? what do I get out of it ?
these damn documentaries don &apos;t make money .
we don &apos;t want to be easy . we don &apos;t want to be healthy .
a lot of people think that I &apos;m sitting on the edge of &quot; The <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but actually I made these films , and these were just a few of them .
there &apos;s no money . there &apos;s no money . what are you doing ?
and I do this all for the value of this experience , for the sake of the challenge -- the most brilliant environment in the sea , and I do all of this as a sense of discovery , as a group of people affected by a very tight team .
because every time we work with 10 to 12 people , we sometimes have to stay in the ocean for two or three months .
and the most important thing that you realize in that <unk> is that you live with one another , you live in a task that cannot explain to another .
and when you go back to the coast , you say , &quot; OK , we need to do this , this optical fiber , this <unk> , this <unk> , this technique , some of the hard work -- all of which are the ones that you can &apos;t explain to other people , like the police , who haven &apos;t shown them .
create a cohesion , creating a cohesive <unk> .
so when I came back to make my next film &quot; Avatar , &quot; and I tried to apply the same principles of leadership -- respect your team , and they <unk> you .
and it really changed the dynamic of the team .
I went back to work with a small team to make new technologies to uncharted territory , to create new technologies that never existed .
exciting .
it &apos;s full of challenges .
in four and a half years , we become a family .
it completely changed the way I made movies .
people review this : you take the sea organisms and bring it back to people &apos;s field and put them on this planet .
and for me , the fundamental law and the process is focused on what happens .
so what did we get from all this ?
what have you learned ?
I think the first thing is curiosity .
this is the most powerful thing you have .
imagination is a force that reflects reality .
and your team is going to be more important than any other person in the world .
and sometimes a young filmmaker asked me , &quot; Your Honor for some of the films . &quot;
and my answer was , don &apos;t stay with you .
other people are going to define you as boundaries , but you don &apos;t control yourself . don &apos;t gamble on yourself .
the United States has a great quote that they love : <unk> failure is not an option .
but in art and exploration , failure must be an option , because it requires a challenge .
none of the things that are important for innovation are done without the risk .
you have to take those risks .
and that &apos;s what I want to leave you with : whatever you do , failure is one of those options , but fear is not . thank you .
what I &apos;m going to talk about today is energy and climate , and that may be a little bit unexpected .
what I want to talk to you about today is energy and climate , and it may surprise that , after all , my full @-@ time job at the foundation of this project is about disease and agriculture , and those that really require us to spread , to improve the lives of the poorest nations in the world .
but in fact , energy and climate are particularly important to these people , in fact , more important than the rest of the world , but in fact , energy and climate are important to these people , in fact , than in other people on the planet .
climate change continues to mean that their crops will not evolve over the years , and that means <unk> or drought , that their crops will continue to grow for years and years , and that means that they will not grow , they will not survive , they will not survive .
that would cause famine , and it would cause a social riots .
so , climate change is going to give them behavioral tools , and it &apos;s important for them .
so , climate change is going to bring them back to life , and it &apos;s important for them .
in fact , if you just reduce the price of something down to poverty , you &apos;d be very likely to get the number one , in fact , if you just reduce the price of something to poverty , you &apos;d be very likely to get the number one .
and as the human species began to come , it was built on the basis of advanced energy .
and as the human species began to come , it was built on the basis of advanced energy .
and the coal revolution that began in the early 20th century , and we had a rapid rise of the Industrial Revolution , and that was the reason why we could enjoy the air conditioner early in the beginning of the 20th century , and we would fall as fast as we could enjoy the refrigerator , and we could have all kinds of things to do .
we &apos;ve come to life in a rich world .
but when we &apos;re further down , let &apos;s say it &apos;s twice as cheap as we make it , we have a new limitation , which is related to CO2 , and we have a new capability , which is related to CO2 .
carbon dioxide is causing global warming , and the formula for carbon dioxide emissions is actually very simple , and carbon dioxide is contributing to global warming , and the formula for carbon dioxide is very simple .
the CO2 emissions today are going to cause the temperature to rise , and the great CO2 emission will cause a temperature rise to the temperature , and the effects of a very profound effect on the weather , whether it &apos;s directly affected by the effects of the ecosystem , or the effects of the ecosystem , or the effects of the ecosystem .
what &apos;s the relationship between carbon dioxide emission and temperature ? why is the difference between the carbon dioxide emission and the temperature of the temperature ? what &apos;s the difference between the two and the temperature ? why is the CO2 increasing and the temperature ? what &apos;s the difference between the two ?
there &apos;s a lot of downsides to global warming , and that can &apos;t be completely certain , but it &apos;s certainly too severe to global warming , and it &apos;s certainly not quite sure , but it &apos;s pretty severe .
I &apos;ve asked all of these best scientists : do we really want to take carbon dioxide down to zero ? I &apos;ve spent a lot of time with the best scientists : do we really have to get CO2 emissions down to zero ?
reduced to half , or maybe a quarter .
and the answer is , unless we get to zero , the temperature goes up , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge , and the answer is , unless we fall to zero , the temperature goes up , that &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
and the answer is , unless we get to zero , the temperature goes up , that &apos;s a huge challenge .
it &apos;s not like having a 12 @-@ foot truck with 10 @-@ foot bridge , as long as you want to get a truck that gives you a 12 @-@ foot truck , a 10 @-@ foot bridge , as long as you can figure it out .
carbon dioxide emissions are completely down to zero .
now we &apos;re going to put a lot of CO2 per year , and we &apos;re going to save a lot of it , and we &apos;re going to save a lot of CO2 per year .
the United States has about 20 tons per capita , and less than a ton per capita , about five tons per capita , about 20 tons per capita , and about less than a ton per capita to about five tons per capita .
the United States has about 20 tons per capita , and less than a ton per capita , about five tons per capita .
anyway , we &apos;re all going to make a difference , and we &apos;re going to make the numbers go down to zero .
and the numbers are still going up , and the lines just slightly lead to the momentum .
the numbers are still going up , and we &apos;re just going to push them up a little bit , and we &apos;re going to push it down , and we &apos;re going to push it down , and we &apos;re going to go down to zero , and we &apos;re going to stop it , and we &apos;re going to get it down to zero .
and the total value of this carbon dioxide , the formula for planting carbon dioxide -- four factors , three @-@ dimensional equations -- is carbon dioxide -- on the left @-@ hand side , our goal is to take it down to zero carbon dioxide per capita -- so we can use CO2 as much as we use per unit , and we can use CO2 as much as we feed it .
obviously , we need at least one factor of three , and this is a simple high school algebra .
obviously , we need at least one factor of three , and this is a very simple high school math , and let &apos;s see , first of all , population .
let &apos;s see , first of all , population .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and that &apos;s going to continue to grow to about nine billion people .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and that &apos;s going to continue to grow to about nine billion people .
if we do this in a new vaccine , health care , reproductive health , and if we do it effectively , if we do it in a new vaccine , developing health care , having a successful vaccine , maybe 10 to 15 percent , combine it to roughly 10 to 15 percent .
the second element is what we use .
this includes everything : the food we eat , the clothing , the clothes , the television , the heat , the heat , the things that we eat , the food , the clothes , the clothes , the heat , the television , the things that are beautiful .
and this includes all sorts of things : the food we eat , the clothes , the clothes , the television , the heat , the heat , the ability to get rid of poverty on the planet , and that means to provide these services to everybody on the planet , and that &apos;s a good thing to do .
getting out of poverty means providing it to everyone on the planet , and that &apos;s a good thing .
in the developed world , the richest one could be controlled , could be controlled , could be reduced to services , and in the developing world , the richest one in which every year , maybe not just control , but in general , this number will be growing up , and it will be more than one year , but it will be more than one year .
in this area , we have a very base of services : do you have any lighting lighting in your house ? in this area , we have services that are very basic : do you have any homework lighting at home ?
and the kids don &apos;t , so they go out and sit underneath the desk under the street , and the kids don &apos;t do it , so they go out and write down the street .
the next factor is efficiency , the energy consumption of every service , and here we have some good news : that &apos;s not going to go up .
and here we have some good news : it won &apos;t go up .
and with all sorts of designs and new ways of lighting , with new vehicles , new ways of building , new ways of making , new ways of lighting , new ways of making , new buildings , we can dramatically reduce the amount of energy we use , individual services , even 90 percent of the services we use .
we can reduce the amount of energy consumed by a lot of services , individual services , even 90 percent .
but other services , such as chemical fertilizers , chemical production , low @-@ level spaces , and other services , such as fertilizer , low @-@ level spaces , such as chemical manufacturing , low @-@ level , but other services , such as fertilizer , low @-@ resolution , high @-@ resolution space .
so , in a combined way , the optimism of this is this : we may be able to achieve three to six times in a row , and in a combined way , the optimism of this is that we might be able to achieve three to four times .
and we &apos;ve been talking about three factors , and we &apos;re going to go from 1.3 tons of tons , and that &apos;s not enough to talk about three factors , and we &apos;re going to go from 130 gigatons , which is not enough to talk about three tons .
and finally , we look at the fourth factor , which is the most critical thing , and in the end , we look at the fourth factor , the fourth factor , which is the CO2 per unit .
so the question is , can this take us down to zero ?
I couldn &apos;t believe it . I couldn &apos;t do it .
I couldn &apos;t believe it . I couldn &apos;t do it .
all of the electricity we have today generates carbon dioxide , except for the developing world , with all the renewables we have today , all the electricity we have , all the electricity we have , except for the developing world .
so we need to create a new system around the world , we need energy miracle , so we need to create a new system around the world , we need energy miracle .
so we need to create a new system around the world , and we need energy miracles .
I used the word magic trick , but it wasn &apos;t impossible .
it &apos;s a miracle . the PC is a miracle , and the Internet and its applications are magic .
it &apos;s a miracle . the PC is a miracle , and the Internet and its applications are magic .
in other words , you &apos;ve seen a lot of amazing things happening .
so typically , we don &apos;t set the stage for wonder , we don &apos;t have a final set of assumptions .
normally , you just don &apos;t do anything , and some magic happens .
but in the lower carbon emission , we have to go all the way , and we have to do that , and we have to do it all together , and we have to push it all together , and we have to do that , at the end of the day .
and I thought , &quot; How can I get this problem better ? &quot;
and I thought , how can I get this problem better ? is there a natural expression of nature that can inspire people &apos;s imaginations ?
I was thinking about a year ago , and I brought some of these mosquitos here to this place , and it was kind of nice to me to think about a year ago , and I brought some of them here , and it seemed like a pretty good idea .
the mosquito had actually realized that there were some people in the world who lived with the mosquito , and it really fully aware that some of the people in the world live with the mosquito .
so today , since I &apos;m talking about energy , I think of this : fireflies .
I decided to release fireflies that would be my contribution to the environment this year .
there are a few natural fireflies who say they don &apos;t bite , and they probably won &apos;t .
there are a few natural fireflies who say they don &apos;t bite , and they probably won &apos;t .
there are a few natural fireflies who say that they don &apos;t bite each other , and maybe they &apos;ve got a lot of innovative things like this one , like fireflies , but they &apos;re actually pretty limited to problems like fireflies , but they &apos;re actually very limited .
what we need is a solution , a solution , a lot of things , a lot of things , a very serious solution , a serious solution , a serious solution , a serious solution , a lot of things we need to do , a lot of stuff , a lot of stuff , a lot of stuff , a lot of damage , and a lot of damage , and a lot of the way , and so far , I think , and I think , and I think , is that people can only five
I didn &apos;t include the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
I don &apos;t include the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the fuel , but the key thing is that , of course , we have to contribute a lot of it , because they seem to have a huge challenge .
let &apos;s start with fossil fuels , <unk> or <unk> , first of all , fossil fuels , <unk> or <unk> .
and what we need to do , in a nutshell , is not that what we need to do is to take all of that burning carbon dioxide , put it all together , stick it out , get rid of the strands , heat , get rid of it , get rid of it , get rid of it , get rid of it .
the current trials have been done 60 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult one to do 100 percent of the time , and it &apos;s going to be about 60 to 80 percent of the time , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult problem , and it &apos;s going to store a lot of CO2 , and it &apos;s a long @-@ term problem .
who would make sure that ?
that waste is worth one billion times as much as any other waste waste , who can make sure that long @-@ term security ? that &apos;s one billion times as much waste as any waste , who can make sure that it &apos;s safe ?
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 .
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 .
next , nuclear energy , again , three big questions .
next , nuclear energy , again , three big problems : its cost , particularly in highly controlled states , is high @-@ security problems , keeping everything available , making sure that even if there &apos;s an artificial response to weapons .
what about nuclear waste ?
it doesn &apos;t take much , but there &apos;s a lot of worry about it .
good solutions have to be secure .
it &apos;s three challenges , but it can be solved , so it &apos;s going to work .
the last three energy sources , I &apos;ll put them together .
these are three sources of energy that people call renewables .
in fact , they don &apos;t need fuel , but they don &apos;t have to .
the first is that the density of energy that these technologies collected , the density of energy , the bigger than the power plant , the first thing is that the density of the technology is collected , is much lower than the plant .
this is energy @-@ intensive agriculture , and it &apos;s the size of a square @-@ kilometer power .
and also , these energy are very unpredictable .
the sun wasn &apos;t all day , and it wasn &apos;t always the same every day , the wind wasn &apos;t always blowing .
if you &apos;re totally dependent on this source , you have other channels of energy , you have to have other channels to get energy , you have to have other channels to get energy .
so , we have a huge cost problem , and we have a huge supply of money , like , some energy source coming from abroad , where you don &apos;t just need energy , but you don &apos;t just have to deal with energy in your own country .
and finally , the issue of storage .
and in order to do this , I looked at all of the current battery , and I looked at the problem , and I looked at all the battery @-@ powered battery tools , the computer , the mobile phone , the Blackberry , the energy , the energy consumption of the world .
so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough to take a 100 times better solution than the present technology , a 100 times better solution than today .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
so we can use 20 percent of the energy we need for 30 percent .
but if you want 100 percent to rely on it , you need a really efficient magic battery .
so what do we do ? what &apos;s the right way ?
is this a Manhattan Project ? how do we get there ?
we need a lot of companies working together , working together , working together .
every one of these five approaches , we all need at least 100 people .
a lot of people inside , and you think they &apos;re crazy , and that &apos;s right .
I think there are a lot of people in the TED community who are starting to do this .
Bill <unk> has <unk> , and one of them is called <unk> , and it &apos;s a very cool , solar @-@ hot , and Bill <unk> has <unk> , and one of them is <unk> , and it &apos;s a very cool , solar @-@ hot technology .
<unk> <unk> investing in <unk> , their job is really cool , and it &apos;s interesting , and I plan to support their projects .
now , the company , <unk> and I &apos;ve been supporting a company , might be surprised , but this company is nuclear energy .
in nuclear energy , there &apos;s a little bit of innovation , like the mold , the liquid , the liquid , etc .
but actually innovation has stopped for a while in the industry , so there &apos;s a few good ideas right now that aren &apos;t weird things .
and the idea was that , instead of burning uranium , you &apos;re looking at things like <unk> , you &apos;re not burning uranium , but you &apos;re looking for 99 percent of the stuff .
it &apos;s a little crazy idea , but actually , people have talked about it for a long time .
it &apos;s a little bit of a crazy idea , but actually , people have been talking about it for a long time , but they haven &apos;t been able to mimic the idea of whether or not it &apos;s possible to have a modern supercomputers , and we can do it now .
and because we were burning , 99 percent of the nuclear waste costs were reduced .
you actually take waste , and you don &apos;t have to worry about how to deal with all of the waste that &apos;s available today , that &apos;s a great message .
we don &apos;t have to worry about how to deal with all the waste from the current nuclear reactors , which is a pretty good news .
it &apos;s like a candle , and it &apos;s increasing uranium .
and the process is like this column , which is normally called a <unk> .
the fuel problem is solved .
this is a waste field in Kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , and that &apos;s 99 percent of all that fuel that &apos;s already out of business , is called <unk> .
these things can power up to hundreds of years .
in addition to that , just through a process of very low @-@ cost water desalination plants .
you see , there &apos;s a lot of challenges in front of you , but this is just one example of one of the ways in which we can continue .
think about how we measure our achievement .
how much should we line up ?
let &apos;s take a look at what we want , and let &apos;s look at what we want to do , and look at what we want to do .
there &apos;s been a lot of people talking about 80 percent by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we have to do it .
and the only 20 percent of the poverty @-@ rich countries , like some agricultural countries , and hopefully we &apos;ve cleaned up the <unk> and the concrete industry .
so , to get to 80 percent of the developed world , and the countries in China need to change their electricity .
and the next level is , do we deploy the technologies that we &apos;ve been developing in every developed world , and we &apos;ve been able to do it in other parts of the world .
that &apos;s important .
and this is the key ingredient for good people .
what should we do in 2020 ?
well , there are two pieces .
we should look at the criteria of looking at the efficiency of looking at the lower temperature of the carbon dioxide , the lower temperature of CO2 .
but in a way , one of the things that we &apos;ve done in 2020 is we &apos;ve done a lot of innovation , but not just the equivalent of a lot of cutting emissions , or lower emissions , and that &apos;s the key to innovation .
we need to be able to get all of these technological advances , so we can use the number of companies , the number of trials , the number of behavioral challenges , the pace of running .
there &apos;s a lot of great books about this topic .
for example , Al &apos;s &quot; Our Choice &quot; and David <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer sustainable energy . &quot;
and they were looking at it , and they built a framework that was easy to talk about , because we had to talk about the problem .
it takes a lot of collaboration .
that &apos;s a wish .
we invented this technology as a very specific wish .
if I could give you a wish for the next 50 years , I could choose who was going to be given a vaccine or a vaccine , which was my passion , or my energy choice , to cut in half , and I would certainly choose energy .
that &apos;s one of the biggest influences .
if we can &apos;t do that , if we don &apos;t think about the short @-@ term goals and the long @-@ term goals , there &apos;s a huge disconnect between the United States and China , between the poorest and the rich countries , and the two billion of us , most of whom have a great impact .
so what do we have to do ?
what do I ask you to engage in ?
we need to increase the research .
in a conference like Copenhagen , the nations should not only talk about carbon dioxide .
we should talk about innovation &apos;s issues , and it &apos;s going to be absolutely shocked to think about innovation .
we really need some market incentives , carbon dioxide , carbon dioxide , <unk> and trade to produce price signals .
we need to get information out .
we should make it more conceptual , more accessible , including the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , and I think it &apos;s a hopeful wish .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you , and I know more about the investment industry , first of all , can you say how big this investment would be ?
Bill Gates : if we just buy a supercomputer , hire good scientists , we &apos;ve done this for about 10 trillion dollars .
and the hardest part of all is to build these reactors for billions of dollars , to get to the manager , to get the first nuclear power stations .
and when you built that first building , if it really works like that , it &apos;s all simple , because its economy , its energy density , is completely different than the nuclear energy that we &apos;re familiar with .
so , does it mean that it needs to be built underneath the building of this sort of <unk> @-@ like column that was built out of this sort of <unk> square @-@ like <unk> square with this sort of giant vertical square @-@ takeoff <unk> and reacted underneath ?
J Yep . now with nuclear reactors , you &apos;ve got to keep adding fuel all the time , so there &apos;s a lot of <unk> and control , and you &apos;ve got to open the reactor , you &apos;ve got to move it out , you &apos;ve got to get rid of it , you &apos;ve got to get rid of it , and it &apos;s possible .
so , if there &apos;s a very cheap fuel , a two @-@ legged ratio , for 60 years , so if there &apos;s a very cheap fuel , a two @-@ size fuel , with a six @-@ meter fuel , put it down in 60 years , there &apos;s no complex consequences .
put them there for 60 years , and then it wasn &apos;t there .
the nuclear power plant is the processed waste itself .
J Yep . and this process came out , and you could just sit there and use it to generate very little waste , and you could put it in a different nuclear power plant .
we can begin to deal with the waste from existing nuclear power plants that we have today , the waste that we &apos;re cooling the <unk> or the reactor , which is where we start .
so , the current problem is that these reactors have become our ingredients , and they &apos;re reducing our waste so that the current material is our problem , but it &apos;s our material , it &apos;s reducing our waste , it &apos;s our problem , it &apos;s our current material , it &apos;s reducing our current waste , it &apos;s our current waste , it &apos;s our current waste .
you talk to people in other places about the possibilities .
who was interested in doing this ?
J We hadn &apos;t chosen a specific place , because there &apos;s been a secret to nuclear problems , a lot of people have been interested in Russia , India , China , companies in China , and I &apos;ve been talking about how to do this in energy history .
I &apos;m optimistic , and also , France and Japan have done some work .
this is a variant of what has been done .
it &apos;s an important improvement , but it &apos;s like a fast @-@ tracking reactor that many countries have built , as long as you &apos;ve got these rapid reactors , it could be the first nuclear waste ever built .
what about the time and the possibility of this project ?
Gates : build a massive power plant , and the cost of running down to very low @-@ cost : build a massive power plant , and it costs us about 20 years to invent .
and that &apos;s basically the end of our environmental model of what our environment does , and it &apos;s basically the result of our environmental model .
and if everything was fine , then of course it would be very easy to meet , and it would be very easy to meet if it didn &apos;t work .
there are still four or five other companies that are doing this , and we need to figure out if they &apos;re going to advance the progress , and if the research is going well , they &apos;re going to compete .
and if it &apos;s successful , then it &apos;s best because it can be used in multiple ways .
but we need at least a way to succeed .
if there &apos;s a big innovation , it &apos;s the biggest innovation you know .
the breakthrough for energy is the most important thing .
even if there &apos;s no environmental limitations , it &apos;s going to be the most important question of the environment , it &apos;s going to be much more pressing .
in nuclear fields , there are other innovators .
but I didn &apos;t know what they were doing , and we didn &apos;t know that some people were innovative in the module , and that was another way .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that &apos;s kind of hard to do , but maybe they look at us in a way .
so there &apos;s a lot of different ways to do that , but the beauty of nuclear energy is that there &apos;s a lot of energy in a lot of other energy , like a million times , but the beauty of nuclear energy is that there &apos;s a certain amount of energy in nuclear , if you can process it , for example , a dark matter of radiation , a negative energy .
Moderator : what if we failed to succeed ?
what kind of heat do we need to take to make sure that the temperature of the planet is ?
Gates : what if things grew to that point , like eating too much , could you have a heart attack ? you might need a heart attack .
there &apos;s a study called geo @-@ engineered technology to slow down global warming for 20 or 30 years .
but that &apos;s like a insurance policy .
you wouldn &apos;t use it .
some people say no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
if you think about the importance of the problem , I don &apos;t know if this is so wise to talk about the earth as a backup plan , in case conditions get worse , or technological , too late .
Moderator : how would you convince them of climate change , if you convince them of climate change ?
LG : unfortunately , the skeptics are from different camps .
very few of them have scientific evidence .
they say that the outcomes of the cloud are due to the relationship of the cloud , and they say the result is because of the cloud .
they have very few compelling evidence that even one in a million .
the main issue here is like HIV .
now , it &apos;s going to double your pain in the future .
so when you come to an issue of concern , there &apos;s a struggle for pain in the future , and there &apos;s a uncertainty report that , in fact , that &apos;s not the worst case , but in the developed world , there &apos;s a report , and there &apos;s no big deal .
in fact , the <unk> aspects of uncertainty should really increase our effort .
but my wish is , if you make energy affordable , you make it economic , and you do it with CO2 , but my wish is , if you make energy , you make it affordable , and then you <unk> it , you say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care about carbon dioxide . &quot;
but I &apos;m going to take this new approach , because energy is cheaper than used to be , and that &apos;s the response to whether you look at something like <unk> , which means that if you spend all your energy trying to solve CO2 , you &apos;re going to replace all the other things that are more important to solve CO2 , or that we &apos;re going to replace the world .
J The actual R &amp; amp ; D is not that much , while the United States should be spending more than 100 bucks on this , it should not have an effect on other things : the R &amp; amp ; D.
J The actual R &amp; amp ; D is not much , until the United States should be spending more than 100 bucks on this , and it should not affect anything else .
for a career , if you don &apos;t have an economic outcome , it &apos;s basically a waste product for me , and there &apos;s a difference between what you need , and if you don &apos;t have an economic contribution , if you don &apos;t have an economy , for me , it &apos;s possible that some people might disagree about what you need , if you don &apos;t have an economic response .
unless you &apos;ve been very close to success , and you &apos;re investing in the portfolio , and it &apos;s going to be very cheap , unless you &apos;ve been very close to success , and you &apos;re investing in the portfolio , and it &apos;s going to be cheap , otherwise I think we should try to have a low @-@ cost solution .
if you &apos;re going to solve the climate problem , you &apos;re going to have to make energy more expensive , you &apos;re going to have to have the rich , you &apos;re going to have to use the money to solve the climate problem , to make it more expensive , to get the energy efficient , to get rich , to get rich .
for those of you who are sitting , if it &apos;s five times more , it &apos;s not going to affect the way we live , it &apos;s not going to affect the way we live .
but for the two billion people on Earth , it &apos;s a disaster .
and the idea of <unk> has changed , and his argument now is that research has not gotten more attention .
and the idea of <unk> has changed , and his argument now is that research has not gotten more attention .
he was a very lonely camp for history , but he had realized that it was a very lonely place , but he had a rather isolated consensus on the history of the camp , and he had a pretty lonely camp .
and I think that &apos;s a very interesting topic , because there &apos;s very few things to do with science .
and I think that &apos;s a really worth discussing , because there &apos;s not enough research involved in science .
Bill , I think most people here are like me , really wish your dream , thank you very much .
thank you .
a few years ago , at TED , Peter <unk> introduced a design challenge called <unk> .
it &apos;s a very simple idea : a group of four people who have a single individual building , the highest material , the 20 <unk> , Italy , a piece of cotton .
the cotton candy has to be on the top .
and it &apos;s not easy , because it requires people to work fast .
I think this is an interesting idea , and I put it in a design conference .
and it was successful .
since then , I &apos;ve been working on more than 70 different design activities around the world , allowing students to work with designers , architects and even wealth , and this practice has inspired us in many ways a lot of ways to teach us about what we do .
usually , people always start talking about this task .
and they were talking about what would happen , and what they said was , they were right and wrong .
and then they spent a little bit of time planning , and they took the drawings and they took them out , and they took the spaghetti sauce .
they used a lot of time to assemble spaghetti sauce on their <unk> .
and then finally , the time was finished , they took the cotton candy and put it on the top of the sugar , and then they went back , and they looked at it .
but most of the time , what really happened was that the <unk> @-@ ha @-@ ha got really bad , because the weight of the cotton candy gives it to the structure .
and some of them got worse and worse than others , and the worst of all , the new business schools .
they were lying , they were lying , they were <unk> , they were very upset .
and there were teams of them , of course , who had created more <unk> , the best of all , the new kindergarten kids .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as Laura Lee told us , they not only built the highest building , but they also built the most interesting structure .
so what do you ask ? what do they have ?
Peter likes to say that , because no child wants to be the CEO of an Italian company , <unk> is the <unk> .
they don &apos;t spend any time on power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
because the business school students , they were trained to find the right thing .
and then they follow the plan .
but the truth is , when they put it at the top of the cotton candy , they use a finite amount of time .
the crisis came .
listen familiar ? yes .
the kindergarten kids do different things , and they start with the cotton candy , and they take a prototype model , and they keep on using prototypes , and they always keep them on top , so they &apos;ve got a lot of opportunities to do this .
and so the designer realized that this was a key ingredient in the interaction .
for every version , the child will quickly get feedback and they know what to do , what doesn &apos;t work .
so the ability to grasp the prototype is real , and let &apos;s see how different teams work .
the average height of most of the <unk> tower is 20 feet high , and the average school student is about half a dozen lawyers , but less than where to go to kindergarten .
who does it best ?
architects and engineers , thank God .
the tallest tower I &apos;ve ever seen is 39 inches .
why ? because they understand that triangles and their patterns of self @-@ preservation are the key to the structure of architectural stability .
the CEOs are above the average , but the interesting thing is that it &apos;s interesting .
if you add a marker to their team , they get a lot better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around , you say , &quot; <unk> won . &quot;
you know , why ?
because they had specific simplicity .
they manage the processes . they understand the processes .
in short , any small group is engaged and focused on the task itself , there &apos;s a dramatic increase in performance .
the combination of special skills and the ability to work together is a combination of simplicity .
if you &apos;ve got 10 people in this campaign , it &apos;s about six of them that can build structures that can stand upright .
I did an interesting experiment .
and I thought , let &apos;s take it .
so I gave birth to a group of 10 million dollars .
and guess what happens to the students who study design ?
what happens ?
and this is the result that none of the groups have done an actual standing on the edge .
and even if any one group has done an inch of a building , they can put the brakes back .
so what &apos;s interesting is that the professionals have a huge impact .
and then we repeated this campaign in the same students .
and guess what ?
and here they know the value of the <unk> model .
so the bottom line became the best team .
they took the lowest amount of time .
and it &apos;s a deep sense of education that really captured the essence of rewards and success .
so , you might ask , &quot; How would somebody spend their time writing a cotton problem ? &quot;
and the reason for that is that I can use straw and processes to help people build cars , video games and visualization .
and the challenge of the cotton candy is to recognize some assumptions that are hidden .
because , frankly , every project has their own cotton candy .
the challenge is to share the experience of a common language .
it &apos;s this simple exercise that gives us valuable experience .
you &apos;re interested in <unk>
this is a blog you can read , and it tells you how to build cotton .
there &apos;s a specific process .
and there &apos;s a strange example from all over the world that people can adapt to the system .
there are world records .
and I believe that the fundamental nature of design is actually a form of communication .
it requires us to take all of our intellectual property and put it in our task , and we want to use the best of our thinking , our sense of actions to welcome our challenge .
and at some point , an experience of a small model will help us turn it into a moment of <unk> , which is the moment of <unk> .
and the result is huge .
thank you .
let &apos;s think of a machine here .
it &apos;s a big , cool machine , TED machine . it &apos;s a time machine .
everybody &apos;s going to walk into this time .
you can choose to go back to the past or to the future , which is not the moment .
and I &apos;m thinking about what you &apos;re going to do , and I &apos;m going to ask my friends a couple of times more about this , and they &apos;re all <unk> back to the past .
I don &apos;t understand . they say , go back to the age of no cars or Twitter or American Idol .
I don &apos;t really understand .
I &apos;m sure there must be some <unk> or some <unk> .
and I can understand that too .
but I have to admit , I &apos;m not in a mess with them .
I don &apos;t want to go back , not because I like adventure .
it &apos;s because the probability of the Earth , it &apos;s not the possibility that you can get to the future .
in other words , I wanted to walk into this machine and go to the future .
our age is the best of all times , whether you look at it in any way , like health , mobility , chance , rate rates go down .
never before .
my grandparents died when they were 60 .
my grandparents died in their early 70s .
my parents died as a child .
I wish I was dying at the beginning of a nine @-@ digit number .
but it &apos;s not just about us , because it &apos;s more than us .
a child born today in New Delhi can be the most brilliant person alive today .
think about it . it &apos;s an amazing fact .
why does this happen ?
because we killed smallpox . smallpox killed hundreds of millions of people on Earth .
it <unk> the demographics of life , and it &apos;s not nearly any war .
but it &apos;s been wiped out today .
it &apos;s a human extinction .
in today &apos;s richest society , just one generation ago , it &apos;s almost no longer a threat .
in Germany , measles was common with polio , almost no .
do you know what those names mean ?
it &apos;s the triumph of medicine and modern medicine , and it &apos;s the winning of the scientific method .
in my opinion , the scientific method is to try and test , to change , it &apos;s one of the greatest <unk> of humankind .
so that &apos;s the good news .
but unfortunately , the good news is so much , because we &apos;ve had other problems , and we &apos;ve talked a lot about it .
one of them is that , although we &apos;ve come up with massive advances , there &apos;s a billion people in the world that live in hunger , they live in starvation every day .
the numbers are coming up , and it &apos;s moving up fast , and that &apos;s allowing us to do it .
not only that , but the imagination of the human imagination gave a huge amount of waste .
drinking water , tropical rainforests , oil , gas , all these resources are disappearing and disappearing , and unless we know about innovation , we don &apos;t have any hope .
the question is , can we do it ? I think we can .
I think we can produce enough food for the billions of people , without damage the land they depend on .
I think we can find the <unk> energy to supply the world &apos;s energy .
and I do believe that that &apos;s true . it &apos;s not true .
but I always couldn &apos;t sleep at night . this is one of the things that kept me awake at night . human history had never looked like this .
and we haven &apos;t had any of these times in history , and we can use them on our will .
in many areas , we were all standing in the midst of an incredible discovery , and in fact , I think we need to look back to this , three years ago , and only in the Renaissance , there were people who were going to be more violent than we were today .
people always like to put themselves in their own framework , and they die so often that they can &apos;t die .
even when they hear truth , they can &apos;t shake them .
listen , everybody can hold up his point , and they can even insist on the idea of progress .
but do you know what you can &apos;t stick with ?
you can &apos;t just stick with what you know . you can &apos;t .
it took me a while to learn .
about 10 years ago , I wrote a story to The New Yorker about a small vaccine .
but what I found was that there was a real struggle against me that they were against the most effective public health measures in human history .
I really didn &apos;t know what to do , and I was just doing what I should do , and I was doing something else .
shortly after , I wrote an article about genetically engineered food .
and then there &apos;s a huge amount of resistance , which is over time .
people were crazy .
so I also wrote an article on that , and I couldn &apos;t really understand why people would understand this as a <unk> food for evil spirits , and I don &apos;t understand why people would think that in a certain way , rather than any other way , that living molecules are natural .
but I was just doing what I needed to do , and I ended up writing and writing about it anyway .
I &apos;m a journalist .
our work is to write and publish and eat , and that &apos;s our life .
but I didn &apos;t know what was going on until I knew it .
the ones that kept me crazy were not molecules .
they &apos;re people who have ideas , people who have educated , who have integrity and integrity .
they &apos;re like people in this room .
it really bothers me .
and I thought , let &apos;s face it .
our age has a different relationship to progress .
we &apos;re looking at progress in a very curious way .
we &apos;re going to be talking about progress in the ironic context , and quote , unquote .
and I think there &apos;s a reason for that , and we know why .
our institutions , for the citizens , are sometimes for the government , even for science , have lost the trust , maybe we do not have the reason to trust .
just to give you a few names , you know why .
Chernobyl , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , the weapons of mass destruction , half of the votes .
I think you can put a list in your mind .
we have a problem with total trust in the past , and we have a little bit of a doubt now .
ask a few questions , ask for proving and evidence .
no one could disagree .
but one thing to notice is that when you get the evidence , you need to take the evidence , but we &apos;re not very good at it .
and the reason for that , I think , is that we now have an epidemic of fear , an epidemic of infectious disease , and a deep <unk> that I &apos;ve never experienced , and I don &apos;t want to go into .
12 years ago , the media had written a message , which was a very scary news , which was taking the autism and the <unk> and the <unk> vaccine .
it &apos;s really scary .
and there &apos;s a lot of research going on around that .
there was a need to do this , because it was a serious event .
and the data came out .
from the United States , Sweden , Canada &apos;s data has shown the same thing : autism and vaccines that don &apos;t have any contact , haven &apos;t really been connected .
but that turns out there &apos;s not a lot of sense for the public , because we like to listen to small stories , and we believe that the eyes of our eyes , believe that what we see in our hearts , we believe in something that makes us real .
but I don &apos;t believe in a stack of <unk> , I don &apos;t believe in government data , and I can understand that , and I think all of us have this kind of psychological .
but what happens ?
the consequences are unbelievable .
listen to this fact : the United States is the only country in the world where measles was failing .
it &apos;s enough for us to be ashamed , and we should be ashamed of that .
it &apos;s a horrible thing .
what caused this happen ?
now I understand . I really understand .
have any of you ever asked yourselves something like this ?
have you ever seen someone die from measles ?
no , no .
in fact , it doesn &apos;t happen in this country , but in the last year , there have been 16 million people dying from measles .
this number is huge , basically 20 people each hour die .
but because it doesn &apos;t happen to us , we can do it any matter of time , people like Mo did , could still be transmitted to their terrified and ignorant .
and the reason they did this is because they didn &apos;t put the reason together .
they also didn &apos;t know that the things that looked like were actually the same .
we need lessons from all of that , and we need to learn more from that .
this guy , <unk> <unk> , is a hero .
because he invented polio vaccine for people to avoid the worst disaster .
now people don &apos;t need to fear this disease , they don &apos;t have the pain , they disappear .
that guy in the middle wasn &apos;t that upsetting .
he &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
he and a couple of other researchers have invented <unk> vaccine .
this vaccine , every year , saves four billion children in the developing world .
it should be good , isn &apos;t it ?
and that &apos;s great . this is Paul going to tell people about this vaccine everywhere , and say how well they are , how better they are .
he did .
so we think of Paul as the terrorists .
when Paul was going to show that he had to be armed with armed guards .
he gets a call at home because people tell him where he &apos;s going to school .
why ? because Paul invented a vaccine .
I didn &apos;t have to talk about this , but it was really important .
once the vaccine stops , it &apos;s going to come back and it &apos;s a terrible disease , and it &apos;s going to happen .
now the United States has measles .
and it gets worse and worse , and very soon , there &apos;s children who are dying of this disease , and that &apos;s just a digital problem .
not just measles .
with polio , who says it doesn &apos;t happen again ?
one of my students at a university was writing a letter to me a couple of weeks ago , and she said I was a little too picky .
no one ever said that before .
she said she wasn &apos;t going to give birth to children . she certainly wasn &apos;t .
okay .
why ? because there &apos;s no polio in this country , but you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have this disease yesterday .
today , I don &apos;t know , perhaps one of the <unk> planes from Lagos , and his destination was Los Angeles airport .
a few hours later , he was on the ground , and he would come to Long Beach , and he was there for a TED dinner .
he didn &apos;t know he was infected with polio , and we didn &apos;t know it was the world .
and the fact that we have is this . don &apos;t think that &apos;s true .
we like to believe that lies . we all love that .
did each of you eaten vitamin <unk> in the morning ?
or if you &apos;re feeling intense , or maybe even a little bit of <unk> , it &apos;s just being fed up with that feeling .
and the reason why you do that is because every day half of Americans do it .
they eat this , they eat it , they eat it , even though we already know that these things don &apos;t work .
that &apos;s what the data says .
you eat these things that make your urine dark , and you can &apos;t do anything .
if you &apos;re willing to spend 280 billion dollars trying to get some black urine , it &apos;s a dark urine .
I hadn &apos;t been averse .
it &apos;s black urine , it &apos;s black .
why do we do that ? why ?
I thought maybe I could understand . we have a huge problem in this country .
and we hate big government , because we don &apos;t trust people in that .
but we don &apos;t have to do that . our healthcare system is very poor .
that &apos;s a cruel system for millions of people .
and for those of us who can afford it , it &apos;s also a form of <unk> and ruthless medical system .
so we wanted to get away from that system . where do we go ?
we put a huge effort into placebo .
this is a wonderful one , and I love placebo .
but you know , it &apos;s a serious thing , because it &apos;s a <unk> thing , but we had hundreds of millions of dollars to buy placebo .
I have all kinds of samples here .
none of them work , whether it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , all of them are <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is , but we spend billions of dollars trying to buy them , which is deception .
but you know what ? when I say that here , people scream for me . they say , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
at least it makes you feel sick . &quot;
you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
I &apos;m not going to go into it . if the American health and the public minister said , &quot; I won &apos;t find any evidence of the breast X number , &quot; or a cancer @-@ free patient who wants to be treated with coffee .
if you believe that belief and magic is not evidence and science , you end up going to a place where you don &apos;t want to go .
maybe you end up being the leader of South Africa .
he insisted that <unk> and <unk> were more effective than we knew about giving AIDS antiretroviral drugs , and that led to 400,000 people dying of HIV .
hundreds of thousands of people who don &apos;t need to die , and that &apos;s where the most severe HIV @-@ infected .
don &apos;t tell me that these examples don &apos;t happen .
the consequences are yes , always there .
now , the most <unk> of all of our ignorance that we &apos;ve come across is the result of genetically engineered crops .
it &apos;s also a stupid argument . we have to stop this argument .
because the argument is just the word and metaphor itself .
it &apos;s about ideology , not about scientific arguments .
every single thing that we have in our stomach , every <unk> , every single <unk> , every single stroke , is changed by himself .
because there were no orange in the garden .
there &apos;s no <unk> .
there &apos;s no Christmas tree . it &apos;s all made @-@ up .
humans have created these things in the last few years .
some trials succeeded . some of them failed .
the ones that failed attempt were enormous .
and now we can do this in a much more precise way , and that &apos;s certainly risky , but we can put vitamin A.
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
I just said , I don &apos;t understand that .
many of us are against genetically engineered foods .
why ?
and the reason I hear a lot about this is that there &apos;s so much chemistry , too much pesticides , too , too much testosterone , too much testosterone , that we don &apos;t really want to make the same kind of crops .
we don &apos;t want businesses to be patents for new crops .
we don &apos;t want to let big companies run .
can you guess what I &apos;m arguing against ?
well , guess it &apos;s right , let &apos;s get the solution together .
well , we had a very serious food problem , but it wasn &apos;t a scientific issue .
because it &apos;s not science .
this is the issue of law , ethics , patent law .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a nation .
not even an idea , it &apos;s a process .
this process sometimes is successful , sometimes failure , but because we &apos;re afraid that we shouldn &apos;t let scientists go and learn how to do it is terrifying , and that can prevent millions of people from getting to prosperity .
in the next 50 years , we need more than 70 percent of the food we have today .
this is the total investment we &apos;ve invested in Africa in the last 30 years .
it &apos;s very embarrassing .
people were there , but we weren &apos;t there yet .
why ? because of genetically engineered foods .
we didn &apos;t encourage people to eat the wrong food , such as the wrong rice .
five million people in the world are living on cassava .
that &apos;s a bit like a crop .
it &apos;s only calories . it tastes bad .
there &apos;s no nutrition , no protein , now there &apos;s a scientist trying to put that in the cassava .
when you eat that , you can avoid being blind .
you can &apos;t starve .
that &apos;s good . it &apos;s not as good as restaurants , but it &apos;s also good .
and I just said , why would some people against this ?
ask yourself , why are we against this ?
do we want to move the genome ?
this is just moving some genomes , nothing related to adding chemicals .
we always want to get more food , better food , more food .
it &apos;s not a meter @-@ wide display ; it &apos;s just trying to get some people to live , and it &apos;s time for us to really understand what it means .
you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , we stick with what we &apos;re going to do right now , and we &apos;re going to do it because we don &apos;t want it to happen , and it &apos;s going to be technological <unk> .
no other word is more appropriate to describe it .
this is a selfish , <unk> , doing this just reducing our dignity , and we have to stop doing that .
now , after a very interesting conversation like this , you might say , you know , you &apos;re going to walk into the machine , and you &apos;re going to go to the future ?
of course . I &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s a machine right now , but we have a great opportunity .
we can set up any time machine .
we can go there . we can go there .
we need to start having conversations like this , and we need to think , when we enter the time of time and the future , we will be thrilled with our choices .
and I believe that we can , and that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
all right .
I was interested in a lot of time when I was interested in <unk> , and usually a magician isn &apos;t interested in giving a placebo , but if you think about it from my career , it &apos;s about making something that actually makes people believe that they become real .
in other words , what you can see here is a drug that you can measure , and what &apos;s called a placebo effect , because people think that what happens to them is a drug effect , or give an example of a drug for a drug called <unk> , and if they believe it &apos;s a drug , there &apos;s a pretty significant effect on them .
the fake thing becomes something because people understand it .
to understand each other , I want to start showing you a very simple , simple magic .
and I will tell you how I became , and this is the simple magic that came from every kid in the &apos; 50s .
when I was in the 1970s , it would be a magic child .
I &apos;ll just show you , and then I &apos;ll explain .
and I &apos;ll leave you with why .
see , this is how it &apos;s magic .
this is a knife . you can check it ; my hand , you can check it .
and I just stuck my fist in my fist .
and then I brush my sleeve up .
and to make sure that nothing can go up and down on my sleeve , I &apos;ll just leave my wrist .
so you can see there &apos;s no time for anything to do , and as long as I can tell you , there &apos;s nothing to do with my sleeve .
it &apos;s very simple .
I &apos;m going to open up my palm and hope , if everything works , my body will stick to it .
in fact , it was so tight that I could even shake the knife and drop it .
nothing in my sleeve , no tricks . you can look at everything .
all right .
well , it &apos;s a magic trick that I often teach kids that are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception by learning about this magic -- although it &apos;s a very simple trick .
there &apos;s probably a lot of people here who know this magic .
this is what happens .
I hold this knife in my hand .
I said I &apos;m going to hold my wrist to make sure there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , which is a lie .
the reason I hold my wrist is the secret of this wrist .
and as I move from my hand to your hand to your fingertips , this fingers , my <unk> , and I &apos;m going to move from here to here to this position .
okay .
there &apos;s a lot of people sitting there .
that &apos;s how my finger moved , from here , right .
and as I rotate my hand , my finger moves .
we can talk about why this has been a liar , and why don &apos;t you note that only three fingers are underneath here , because your consciousness , and the way we process consciousness , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three .
but that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to talk about today . right ? I &apos;m going to open my palm up .
obviously it &apos;s lined up there , not through any physiological magnet , but through deception , my <unk> .
and I would shake my fingers , and again , as I would , I would hide my fingers at some point .
shake the hand . you take the knife .
this trick you can do with your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with a placebo ?
I read a study about a year ago , and it opened my mind .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this is a pretty surprising thing to me .
it shows that if you give people a placebo @-@ controlled form of a placebo , like an aspirin , if it &apos;s a circle of white pills , it has a measurable effect .
but if you change the form of placebo sugar , for example , you take it as a small pill , and you paint it in blue , and it has a much more measurable effect .
even though none of them had any real medicine -- they were all <unk> .
but the white pills are just not blue .
what ? it really confused me .
but in fact , that &apos;s not the end .
if you take the capsule , they &apos;re more effective than any form of pills .
there &apos;s a color capsule , and there &apos;s yellow at one end , and the red one is more effective than the white capsule .
the dose was done .
one day two , one day nothing worked . I &apos;m running the statistics . sorry .
but the point is .
there &apos;s a dose of drugs .
<unk> form and medicine .
if you want extreme <unk> , you need an injection of <unk> .
right ? one or two <unk> of a syringe , you inject it into a patient .
in their mind , this was such a powerful idea that it should be much more <unk> than white pills .
it &apos;s a very solid idea , and when I have the slide here , I can show you the statistics .
the point is , the white pill has no blue pill , no <unk> .
they don &apos;t really have medicine . it &apos;s just your belief that making it real , and it makes it more robust to you .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to magic techniques .
some apparently a fake trick made it look real .
we know from the study that if you want to take a look , you take a look .
this is a <unk> cap . it &apos;s very fine . I &apos;ll just take it away .
this is my muscle . this is not a muscle .
this is my skin . this is not Hollywood special effects .
I &apos;m going to stick it in my skin and bring it over the other side .
if you &apos;re ever more nervous -- if you &apos;re easy to remember -- I showed some friends yesterday in the hotel , and some of them I don &apos;t know , there &apos;s a woman who almost died .
so , I would suggest that if you &apos;re easy to remember , you &apos;d better be able to look anywhere in the next 30 seconds , actually , you know , I &apos;d be doing the wrong part behind it .
you &apos;ll see , you can see elsewhere if you want .
well , this is what happened , right next to my lower arm in the lower @-@ hand corner of my arm , I created a small hole .
sorry . have I scared of you ?
and I went through my skin on the other end .
now , we &apos;re basically in the same position as a knife .
pretty much .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers now , right ?
so let me show them . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah . Oh .
I know what people want when they see this .
and they said , &quot; Well , he &apos;s not going to break down his skin and play us in a couple of minutes .
so let me peek here .
so what does that look like ? good .
yeah , I know .
the people in the back said , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t really see that . I don &apos;t really see that . &quot;
people in the remote room are now capable of filtering .
let me show you this .
this is actually my skin . this is not a Hollywood effect .
that &apos;s my meat , and I can turn it around .
sorry . if you feel disgust , look somewhere else , forget this .
the person in the back , or a few years from the video , will say , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s a little bit missing , but if it &apos;s real , there &apos;s a hole , there &apos;s a hole , if it &apos;s real .
let me give you some blood .
yes , that &apos;s it .
now , normally I would take the needle out .
I would wash my arms and show you I didn &apos;t have any injury .
but I think in this case , in this case , things that are real , and I &apos;m going to stop here and walk down .
I &apos;m going to see you in the next few days .
I want you to look forward . thank you very much .
most of you are talking about pleasure recently .
in the last five years , I &apos;ve asked more people in recent years about the title of &quot; happiness , &quot; and they &apos;ll count about 40 , and there &apos;s so much more to it .
more and more researchers have come to interest in this issue of happiness .
and there &apos;s a lot of them teaching .
making other people happy is their goal .
and while these kinds of jobs continue to have a couple of cognitive traps , these will increase the complexity of happiness .
I &apos;m going to focus on these cognitive <unk> .
these traps <unk> influence what people think of as their happiness , and they affect the way we see happiness , because we all go wrong .
the first trap was the complexity of happiness .
and it turns out that happiness is no longer a word of regular words , because we have too many things to do .
I think we should define what it means , but generally we have to give up this idea of what it &apos;s like to live in a more complex way .
the second trap is the association between experience and memory : basically it &apos;s in life and feeling pleasure and pleasure and being happy about your life .
the meaning of both of these things , when they &apos;re happy , is very remote .
the third trap is the illusion , unfortunately , in any case , when we think about the pleasant life , we think it &apos;s important .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
it &apos;s <unk> .
now , I want to start with an example , with a man named <unk> <unk> <unk> , who told me a story about &#91; unclear &#93; . &#91; unclear &#93; , he said he was having a very nice sound when he was listening to the orchestra , but at the end of the recording , the <unk> were coming out .
and then he was thrilled to be able to show that this is a mouse that &apos;s broken .
but it wasn &apos;t .
and what &apos;s happening is that it &apos;s just the experience .
he experienced this experience .
and he went through 20 minutes of hearing winner .
but now it &apos;s a little bit smaller , because the night sky leaves a memory ; it &apos;s that awful memory , whereas the other 20 @-@ minute prizes are completely forgotten .
this tells us that we have two selves when we think about ourselves and other people .
the first one is a self @-@ experience , and it &apos;s a self that lives at the moment , and the insights into the past , but basically he &apos;s only now .
and what you normally do is you come across from the experience -- as the doctor says to you , do you touch me when I touch you here ?
another self is a memory , and he &apos;s in charge of his life , and he &apos;s in charge of his life , and he &apos;s looking for him , and he &apos;s going to ask , &quot; How does he feel today ? &quot;
or do you want to go to Italy , or do something like that ?
experience and self @-@ experience is completely different , and the combination of those two is part of why we don &apos;t understand happiness .
it &apos;s about self @-@ awareness .
and the story starts to capture just from memory -- real time upload .
it &apos;s not the stories we tell .
it &apos;s our memory to tell stories , and it &apos;s the story that we stored in our experience .
let me start with an example .
this is an ancient study .
some of the real patients are going to adopt a process of pain .
details don &apos;t go into details anymore . the therapies are no longer true anymore , but when it comes to the 1990s , it &apos;s a terrible solution .
every six seconds , the patient has to report their pain index .
here are two patients . this is their record .
and I asked you , &quot; Who &apos;s My <unk> in them ? &quot;
it &apos;s very simple .
obviously the patient was a patient . he had a long queue , and the patients had a sense of <unk> A , and B felt , and stayed long .
but there &apos;s another question : do these patients think they &apos;re suffering ?
here &apos;s a little accident .
and the amazing thing is that the patient &apos;s memory of a tree is actually worse than the patient .
these are two anecdotes that are different , and the end of the story .
both stories don &apos;t spark intelligence -- but obviously they &apos;re different .
one of them obviously felt worse than another .
it &apos;s a horrible sense , and it &apos;s not a good story at the end of the season .
how did we know that ?
because we asked them at the end of the session , and we asked them one more time later , what do you think about the weight of the <unk> ?
it turns out that A &apos;s memory is obviously worse than B.
now this is a direct conflict between experience and memory .
from a self @-@ experience , the patient &apos;s point of view is obviously struggling .
so how do we actually do a clinical trial when we do this , and when we do this , we get results , and we can actually shrink the duration of the patient and then slow down the <unk> .
the patients still suffer , but they &apos;ve lost a lot .
and if you continue that , you &apos;re going to make the experience of the patient &apos;s own experience worse , but the patient &apos;s memory is a better one , because you give the patient a better story , a better memory , a story of his experience .
how do you define a story as good or bad ?
and it &apos;s a real story that we tell , and it &apos;s true .
the good news is it takes a few hours to end .
and the ending is very important , and the story on that is led by the end .
now , experience itself as a life .
he had a moment of experience , one after another .
and you say , what do you do for a moment ?
and the answer was simple . they never disappeared .
most of our lives -- I &apos;ll just take a second round of time -- just three seconds from a psychology point of view , and that means there &apos;s about four or three thousand moments of human life , and in a month , there &apos;s about four or three thousand moments .
most of them were completely ignored .
and yet , you can also see that some of the feelings are stored , because every moment in our experience , it &apos;s made up our lives .
as long as we &apos;re alive , we &apos;re using these limited resources .
how to use them , it seems to be important , but it &apos;s not the story of our own ego .
so the memory self and experience is very different .
the biggest difference between them is the way to deal with time .
in experience , if you have a vacation , the first week is as happy as the first week of the week , the amount of joy that comes out of the vacation is twice the amount of fuel .
and yet , the memory itself is not the same .
for the memory self , two weeks , it wasn &apos;t any more than a week of vacation , because there wasn &apos;t any new kind of exhaust .
the story is still alive .
so time is the key ingredient for self @-@ expression and experience , and time doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s not just memory and telling stories .
and it &apos;s also a matter of making decisions , because , if your patient has been through two different types of surgeons to do <unk> , and now the decision is to take a look from one of them , the patient &apos;s choices will feel better than the memory , and that &apos;s how the doctor chooses .
experience itself is about choices .
in fact , we &apos;re not going to choose between these two experiences . we &apos;re choices .
and when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think in the form of experience .
we have a vision of the future of memories .
and by and large , you can see that memory itself is a tyrant , you can imagine that the memory is pulling itself out of the <unk> of the experience and taking the experience out of it .
and I had an idea that when we were closed , there was a big part of it for our own memories .
I think that &apos;s a little bit of a heat show .
how much memory do we use ?
that could explain why memory itself became the dominant self .
it reminded me of a vacation where I spent a couple of years at the South Pole , which is one of my greatest <unk> , and I tend to think of this vacation .
it took me about a three @-@ week trip , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , as I opened my eyes , there &apos;s about 600 photographs in it , and I might take an hour to remember .
three weeks of the expedition took the most of the week .
it seemed to be out of sync .
it was a little bit uncomfortable , because I remember it &apos;s a really small problem , but there &apos;s a real problem here , and why do we use our experience more than we rely on it ?
so I want you to think about an experiment about thinking .
if you were to take the next vacation , if you knew that all of the photographs that were destroyed afterwards , you would swallow a pill and you would ignore it .
do you think about the same vacation ?
if you choose a different kind of vacation between your two selves , you &apos;re going to get conflicting ideas , which is not easy , because if you &apos;re just going to have an answer , you &apos;re going to get another answer .
the question that we have to ask is , why don &apos;t we just choose between our two selves ?
now , two selves have different ideas about pleasure .
the two opposing beliefs corresponds to two selves .
so you ask , how happy is it to be ?
and then you ask , &quot; How happy is it ? how happy is it ? &quot;
these moments of joy are complex .
how does emotion measure ?
by the way , we now have a rough notion of self @-@ experience as time and pleasure .
and the pleasant life , by itself , is completely silent .
it &apos;s not a question of how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s a question of how happy it is .
radically different perceptions .
if you can &apos;t tell the difference between these two ideas , I can &apos;t define happiness as any one of the other great students I &apos;ve been living with , and that &apos;s why .
in recent years , differences between self @-@ happiness and memory , self @-@ sustaining , are currently trying to separate between the two .
the Gallup Organization recently conducted a poll that was asked by over half a million people around the world , and that &apos;s how they looked at their lives and how they looked at them , except for this question , this company did another survey .
in recent years , we &apos;ve come to understand two insights about happiness .
and I think what we &apos;ve learned is that the opposite is the same .
you can tell if somebody is happy about life , but you can &apos;t tell you how happy they are , and vice versa .
just to give you an idea of the connection , they &apos;re about 50 percent related .
it means when you meet someone , you &apos;re told that his dad has high @-@ rises , can you know how tall this guy is ?
well , you might have a basic idea , but it &apos;s very uncertain .
you couldn &apos;t define it .
and if I say somebody gives their own life mass , he plays eight / 10 , and you can &apos;t grasp how happy they are .
so the connection is very low .
we know what makes people happy .
we know that money is important , it &apos;s important .
we know that happiness needs to be met by the people we love , and it takes time to stay with them .
there are other factors , but this is the main factor .
so if you want to make both of them happy , you &apos;ve got to throw away and do something different .
I mean , we shouldn &apos;t treat pleasure as a good name .
these are the differences .
now , one of the reasons why we don &apos;t understand happiness very quickly is that we see life as different from how we live .
so when you ask people in California how happy are you ?
because when you do that , you think it &apos;s a little bit fun , and you live in Ohio .
when you want to live in California , you think about the differences between California and other <unk> , like climate .
it turns out that climate conditions are not important for experience , and it &apos;s not important to think about how happy they are .
now , since the real world is dominated by ideas , some people might have come to a conclusion , which is to move to California .
they moved to California for a better life , and they were tracking what was going to be a pretty interesting thing .
their experience is not going to be happier .
we all know that .
but one of the things that happened was that they thought they were happy , because when they thought about it , they remembered that Ohio was the right thing .
it &apos;s really hard to understand pleasure , and I hope I &apos;ve given you a basic idea of how hard this process is .
thank you .
thank you . I have a question to ask you .
thank you very much .
a couple of weeks ago , we had a telephone , and you heard an interesting phenomenon from a Gallup survey .
can you share it with us ? we have a couple of minutes .
Daniel Libeskind : okay .
I found a very intriguing number from the Gallup world that I found out that it was an accident .
we found a phenomenon about self @-@ experience .
that &apos;s how much people feel about their income .
and it turns out that for Americans who are less than half a year @-@ olds in the United States , this is a very large part of the picture , and there &apos;s almost 130 million of them , and these people are pretty high @-@ level .
that &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
people who earn less are less happy and less income are happier than they are .
and when you get more than 60,000 , we get a horizontal line .
it &apos;s a very nice way to see a very flat line .
obviously money doesn &apos;t buy the experience , but it doesn &apos;t have the money to give you a sense of what it is , and we know that it &apos;s very painful .
you have a story of self @-@ reliance on another self .
the more you make , the more you get .
it has nothing to do with emotion .
yet , life , liberty and pursuit of happiness is the goal of all Americans struggle .
if you all look at this , then it &apos;s going to turn our assumptions into something like this , like , <unk> policy and so on .
could the political figures in this country look like this and see what it would look like ?
<unk> : I think there &apos;s a sense of what pleasure is about .
but this was an idea that was too big in the United States , and it was certainly in the U.K. , and it was going to be giving birth to the rest of the world .
and you start to realize that when you start thinking about policy , you should also put happiness into action .
now , this is going to take a moment , but people are starting to think about it . what they &apos;re going to do is they &apos;re going to experience pleasure , or they &apos;re going to rate it , and so very quickly , we &apos;re going to understand this .
it &apos;s a way of <unk> happiness , a few other ways , but it &apos;s about what you think , and what you think about is self @-@ exploration .
I think within a few years , that &apos;s going to impact policy .
America has paid a huge amount of effort to measure happiness .
I think in 10 years or 20 years , this will be part of the national data .
this issue is going to be the most policy issue in the next few years .
thank you very much for creating behavioral economics .
thank you very much .
I &apos;m a game designer .
I &apos;ve been working on online games for 10 years , and the goal of the next decade is to be able to be able to be able to answer questions like game play .
now , the reason I want to explain to you why I say this is that , if people have bigger , bigger games , and , of course , those of you in this room , and spend more time in the game , you think that I have more powerful questions .
people today play online games can reach out to three billion hours a week .
some of you may think that games spend a lot of time games .
maybe there &apos;s a lot more , because there &apos;s a lot of pressing problems that we need to deal with .
and yet , according to the research that I have in the future , we don &apos;t spend a lot of time on games .
three hundred and thirty @-@ six hours a week , the world is far more difficult to solve the problems in real life .
in fact , I think that in order to live better on Earth , in fact , I think we need to live a lot more time on Earth .
and I was computation , and the time we needed was <unk> billion hours per week .
maybe it &apos;s counterintuitive , but I want to repeat to that , so that the ideas that we have to understand , if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , and I believe that we need to be motivated to play video game play , and at least 10 years from now .
actually , I &apos;m serious . I &apos;m not kidding .
and here &apos;s the reason why we take this scenario and we organize it together as a form of reason for the human race to survive .
this is a portrait shot by <unk> .
he wanted to capture some of the emotions that were played in front of the game .
this is the classic expression of a player .
now , if you &apos;re not a game player , you &apos;re not going to be able to photograph what this photograph really means .
you may feel that pressing , pressing , psychological fear , not mental disorders , or empathy , is a problem .
if you &apos;re a game player , you &apos;re feeling a few different things around the corner of the eye , including the folds of the fabric of the neighborhood around the corner , and this is a very optimistic sign , and it &apos;s a sign of the eyebrow .
this suggests that this game is about to get epic performance in the game .
you &apos;ve heard this word before , which means some of you are a player .
this epic victory is a result , but it &apos;s very exciting before you even think of it .
it &apos;s even beyond your imagination .
and when you do that , you will be struck by the skills of your own skill , which is the so @-@ called <unk> epic .
and the player is about to fulfill this .
at the same time , this is what we expect , and what we want to do is to deal with the problems of the world , the people who have obstacles , the people who have obstacles that come from them , are the <unk> of people .
now , unfortunately , when we deal with the <unk> of our daily life , we often see that expression .
I usually call this an <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> , which is , in fact , the one I make , to see if I come out of it ? OK .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> I made , not the best way to live in a <unk> .
and this is also one of the things that I studied in my Berkeley when I was an old community , an old community , an old community of mine , and I read Dr. <unk> , and that &apos;s why we think that the Virtual Choir is better than the real world .
and it &apos;s also a lot of game play .
we feel like we can &apos;t adapt to real life in a game .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s successful ; it &apos;s not a part of the <unk> ; it &apos;s a part of the success .
we do have a lot more success in the world , but here &apos;s what we call an internal motivation , a collaborative inspiration and collaboration .
when we &apos;re in the game world , I think we can do the best of ourselves , and when we see a message , we can help other people and solve the problem of solving a problem , and we can stand up , and continue on .
but in real life , when we &apos;re confronted with failure , we don &apos;t normally feel that when we &apos;re confronted with failure .
we usually feel overwhelmed and worry and worry and anxiety and anxiety and anxiety and <unk> and <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have a game during that time , and we didn &apos;t have that feeling .
this is what I studied when I was a graduate student .
could the game make us think , can we do anything ?
how do we get this sense of separation from play to work in the real world ?
so I looked at games like &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; and these are the ideal platforms for dealing with collaborative issues .
and I noticed that some of these things were the kind of things that made epic play possible in online play .
the first thing is , whenever you show up in these online game games , there &apos;s a lot of different characters in World War II games , and they trust you very much , and they help you do the task of saving the world .
but it &apos;s not all the tasks that look like this , but it &apos;s just the ones that match your current level .
so you have the ability to do it .
designers aren &apos;t going to give you a mission you can &apos;t do right now .
but finishing this task requires you to be the limit of your ability , and therefore , you have to do the best job in World of Warcraft .
there &apos;s no audience there , and there &apos;s something very special and important to do .
and there &apos;s a lot of people in the world who can work together .
and everywhere you go , there are hundreds of thousands of people waiting to be done with you .
in real life , there &apos;s no such thing as a kind of anesthesia , and there &apos;s thousands of partners around our fingertips .
there are wonderful stories about how we do it , and these stories attract us , and inspiring what we do .
at the same time , there &apos;s a positive response for any effort that we &apos;ve done .
you &apos;ve heard about the rise of the hierarchy , with the level of the hierarchy , with the level of the hierarchy , with the level of intelligence .
and we don &apos;t have that kind of consistency in real life .
for example , when I was walking down this stage , I was not going to be able to speak up , I was going to be able to speak up , to be more creative , to say , 20 more ideas .
I didn &apos;t get any rewards in real life .
in post @-@ conflict situations , like &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; for example , World of Warcraft and collaboration , is a very <unk> event , because we can continue to win and win , and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t stop playing around the world .
because it &apos;s better than reality .
so far , the World War II game player , the World War II game player , had spent the total amount of time trying to solve all of the virtual problems in World War I.
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
but it sounds like a bad thing .
and we wrote these numbers , and we started walking upright apes , as humans , evolved .
this is the first upright @-@ walking primates .
so when we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend on this game , the only way to make it reasonable is to think about how much time we spend in human evolution and how much time we spend .
and to think about it is the right thing , because what you find is that we spend a lot of time playing games , and we can change the capacity of our people , and we can change our ability to be human .
we &apos;re moving forward to becoming a more collaborative spirit and robust species .
it &apos;s true . I believe it .
if you look at a really interesting survey , it was published by a group of researchers at Carnegie Mellon , in an atmosphere where young people are playing in a very strong atmosphere today , where today &apos;s 21 years old , average people spend 10,000 hours on average .
now , 10,000 hours is a very interesting value because there are two reasons .
first of all , the children of the United States went from high school to high school were <unk> hours , and of course you had to do well on time .
we had a parallel processing data which showed that young people were doing a good game , and they were learning as much as they were in school .
some of you have probably read the latest book , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so you &apos;re not as familiar with the idea of successful theory as you &apos;re having 10,000 hours of success .
and the law is based on cognitive science , and if we spend 10,000 hours in the age of 21 , we can do something else , and we must have a huge success in those things .
we &apos;re going to become world experts in everything we do .
now , what we &apos;re looking at is the full generation of young people who are playing .
the big question is , what are the players doing ? what are the players doing ?
if we could give the answer , we would eliminate an unprecedented human resources .
they &apos;re the ones that we have today that spend at least one @-@ hour online play game players .
they &apos;re a brilliant game . five billion people are really good at something .
and in the next 10 years , there &apos;s going to be a couple of hundred and a half million gamers that are really good at this .
if you haven &apos;t heard about it , then I tell you , it &apos;s happening .
the game industry has been evolving for so long , with its roots , its transformation of the Internet to the wireless Internet , to the international players , particularly from India , from China , from Brazil , from the same platforms .
in the next decade , there will be a billion new players in the next decade .
and we had 15 game players .
so I started thinking early , where are these games going to lead us ?
and I think there are four things to this , and the first is the positive , the positive , the emergency .
think of it as an inspiring ego .
the existential challenge was to combine myself and to solve the problems immediately .
the game players always believe that there &apos;s no way to win or to win .
the gamers are not isolated .
they &apos;re very good at creating strict social structure .
one of the interesting surveys shows that we prefer people who play a game with us , even though they beat me , they did .
and the reason for that is that we accumulate trust in the game , and that &apos;s because in the game process , we create trust .
the reason why we trust that is because they spend the same time with the same rules that we spend on , we &apos;re going to fight side by side by side .
in this case , games can really create agreements , trust and collaboration .
and we will create a more robust social network .
I love that .
the World War II player , the average World War II player , spent 22 hours on average , was part @-@ time games .
it &apos;s because when we play games , when we &apos;re having a games of leisure or a game , we &apos;re having a lot of fun .
as a human being , we like to do it more difficult , but it &apos;s more interesting .
if you can provide a task to the player , they &apos;re constantly trying to play .
and finally , it &apos;s a epic meaning .
the game player likes to carry on in the work of the story of &quot; Star Wars . &quot;
anything that you do , any little bit of routine , is going to be part of that ultimate vision , which is that you &apos;ve all heard about Wikipedia , the biggest <unk> of all the world , the world , the biggest <unk> , the one that you can build together .
the second largest bank in the world , &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; has about eight million hits .
every month , 500 million people are using it .
it &apos;s based on &quot; World of Warcraft &quot; information , much more than any other theme on the Web .
and this creates a sort of epic story .
and it was also a story about &quot; World of Warcraft . &quot;
this is the example of bringing those four superpowers to an event where players are a highly licensed , highly motivated community .
they all think that they have the ability to change the world , they all think they have the ability to change the world .
but the problem is they believe they can change the world , not the real world .
that &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s a guy named <unk> <unk> .
his work was extraordinary . he studied why people spend so much time and energy and money online play .
he said , &quot; We &apos;re seeing lots of people who live in virtual worlds and game play . &quot;
because he &apos;s an economist , he &apos;s rational .
and he said ...
unlike me , I &apos;m a game designer , and I &apos;m full of energy .
and he also said that play becomes more meaningful because the game players have more things in the virtual world than in real life .
they can have better social relations in the video , and they can get much better outcomes than real life , much better engagement and fulfilled in real life .
so he said that for the game players , it took more time to spend more time in the virtual space than it is in real world .
now I still think that &apos;s rational .
but nevertheless , it &apos;s not the best option .
we have to start building from the present moment to the real world as a game .
so I got inspiration from something that happened 25 years ago .
these are old dice , made from bone ash to bone .
before we had designed the game controller , we humans had the collections of sheep .
this is the earliest game equipment ever devised .
if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient Greek historians , like the Greek historian , you will know what the history of this history is and why .
the night bear said , &quot; especially the Christmas game is invented by <unk> . &quot;
now , obviously , there was this terrible famine event in history , and the king decided to do something crazy .
people were suffering and fighting battles .
it &apos;s a crisis . they need an extreme solution .
and according to that , they invented the dice and created a policy across the country , where everyone could eat , but the next day , everybody could play a game .
people listen to night bears because they &apos;re very attractive to get us to live in such a self @-@ fulfilling and well @-@ being , and people forget the fact that they don &apos;t have food .
the next day , people were playing through games , and the next day they were going to eat .
according to the old nations , the people in the form of <unk> have spent 18 years eating one day @-@ to @-@ day games , and they have great famine .
this is how we look at games today .
we play games with painful pain .
we use games to avoid the real world , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the things we need .
and this process can be done forever .
this is very exciting .
in August , 18 years later , the great famine had no better , more positive signs , so the king decided to play the last game .
he divided the nation on average by two groups .
together they play a game of dice , and one of the winners of the dice is going to take a ride .
they &apos;re going to go out and look for a new place to stay alive , and they &apos;re going to be able to live in a place where they &apos;re going to live with a famine .
it sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but recently DNA evidence shows that the ancestors of the Roman Empire -- the same thing as the <unk> .
and scientists have recently discovered this crazy story in history .
and geologists also looked at the evidence that there had been four decades of global cooling off , which is why this big famine was coming .
so this seemingly crazy story is real .
they were able to get their culture out of play , and they were able to get their culture out of the game for 18 years , and they were able to figure out how to get people out of the game , and they were able to save the entire civilization .
we can do it this way .
people have been playing World War II since 1994 .
this is the first real @-@ time game in World of Warcraft , 16 years ago .
this was an 18 @-@ year @-@ old game , and we played the dice .
so I would argue that we &apos;re ready to accept a game that can change our lives .
this is the discovery of one half of civilization , looking for the new world , and we now have six billion hours of play .
let half of us play games every single day for an hour , until we get to the real world problem .
and you might ask , how can we solve the real problems in the game ? well , this is what I &apos;ve been working on for the last few years , and what I &apos;ve been working on , what I call the <unk> Institute for the future .
this is an ad in our <unk> office , and it tells us a lot about how we think about the future .
we &apos;re not going to try and predict the future .
but we will create the future .
we had a vision of what would happen , and then we wanted to see it through trying to get people to see it as a reality .
we crave the epic triumph , and we gave people the best .
I want to give you a quick clip of some of the games I &apos;ve been doing , some of the attempts , trying to give the future of people to create their own epic success , some of the ways .
this is &quot; The <unk> World . &quot;
this was done in 2007 .
this is a online game , and it gives you a chance to survive .
the lack of oil is fiction , but we &apos;re going to spend a lot of what you think is real , and it &apos;s going to affect your real @-@ world information , and we &apos;re not going to be able to switch off , so when you open up the game and tell us what &apos;s going to happen in real time .
in 2007 , a group of 17 had been tested in this game , and we tracked the first three years of life .
and what I can tell you is that this is a very revolutionary experience .
no one wanted to change their way of life , or because they felt it was an environmental response , or because they felt it <unk> .
but if you allow them to open up an extraordinary experience and tell them that we already run out of oil .
it &apos;s going to be a wonderful story that you &apos;ve heard about and extraordinary experience .
challenge yourself , to see how you live , most of the players in the game , keep the ones that they &apos;re used to in the game , to keep the players in the game .
in the next game of saving the world , one of the problems we &apos;ve chosen is more difficult than the oil sector .
we did a game called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which was a game called <unk> , and we did a game called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the premise of this game is , supercomputers live on the Earth for 23 years .
this is a supercomputer called the World <unk> Survey .
people were playing in a game like Jerry <unk> .
you all know about the movies of <unk> , you organized an <unk> , you had an astronaut , a team of scientists , some of the world &apos;s staff .
in the game that we designed , we didn &apos;t have the five groups of five , we designed them to be one of the four largest groups of people , and your job is to develop the energy , the food , the security , the security of the future , the security of our society .
we had 8,000 people play this game , eight weeks .
they came up with 500 crazy solutions , but there &apos;s really creative solutions , and if you could go online and go to Google <unk> , you could see the results .
the last game we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to be able to line it up in March , and this is a game done with the World Bank .
if you could do this , you would be part of the World Bank community of the World Bank , and you would be part of the approval of a modern society .
in collaboration with sub @-@ Saharan Africa , we &apos;re inviting them to participate in social innovation .
games are more like a cartoon fiction . we have an equilibrium of things , like deep insights , of knowledge , of sustainability , and so on .
I invite all of you to really share the game with the young people everywhere , especially in the developing world , and to bring people together , to start thinking about their own social enterprises , to save the world .
I &apos;m going to finish my talk .
I want to ask a question .
what &apos;s going to happen ?
we have this great game player that we play , and we have these games that may be the test of what we &apos;re going to do in the future , but nothing has ever saved .
and I want you to agree with me that the player is a huge human @-@ powered <unk> , and we can get them to work on the real world , because of that , the game is a revolution .
we have these wonderful superpowers , the ability of our happiness , our ability to organize our social structure , our ability to flourish , and to flourish .
and I would like to be honest with you , to play with the great game @-@ <unk> that can live on this planet in the next century .
and I want you to join us in making or supporting games like this .
and when I look forward to the next 10 years , I &apos;m pretty sure , first of all , we can create any future we can imagine , and second , we can play any game we want to play .
let &apos;s start changing the world .
thank you .
I want to share with you a couple of months ago a big discovery I was working on in an Italian magazine .
when I was writing , I was always putting the dictionary next to me , and I was able to get the article out , and it was true that I hadn &apos;t found anything in the dictionary in my life .
let me read this out for you .
the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the helpless , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the loss of suffering , the body .
conversely , <unk> , strong , empowered , empowered <unk> .
I read it to a friend of mine when I read it , and it was ridiculous that when the books were <unk> and <unk> were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and I had to stop trying to get my words out of harm .
yes , my old version of this old <unk> was a little too old , and I thought , &quot; Well , it must be old . &quot;
but in fact , it was in the &apos; 80s when I was supposed to be able to identify the circumstances of my family and the world around me .
thankfully , I hadn &apos;t spent the time alone .
what I mean by that is that , by using a dictionary of <unk> interpretation of disability , I can tell you that the world I live in is not like me , the disabled world thinks that we have absolutely positive effects , but today , I &apos;m bringing them to my life , and I &apos;m glad that I live in a world where I live .
so I went online and looked at the <unk> of the disabled , and in 2009 , I was looking forward to seeing some important change .
and I &apos;m going to show you a new version of the <unk> disabled .
unfortunately , it wasn &apos;t a lot better than that .
the other word &quot; almost equally &quot; in the opposite , &quot; which I am very uncomfortable with : <unk> , <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s not just a few words .
when people use that negative term for the disabled , it &apos;s actually reflecting on the idea of the disability .
what was remarkable about this is the value of the people who were present in the vocabulary of the disabled , and the process of their own value .
our language affects our mind and the way we see the world , the way we see it , the way we see it .
in fact , there are many ancient forms of the ancient Greeks and the ancient world , ancient world , believing in the power of speech , because once it &apos;s said , it &apos;s true .
so , what do we really want to be ? it &apos;s somebody who has no ability , or who has the ability .
and sometimes we just give them names for an adults or a child , but we also give them possibilities to question their own .
don &apos;t we want to open up the hearts ?
and one of my life was this guy who set me up the door of the heart , and he was a doctor who was taking care of me as a child , and he was at the <unk> Island Institute .
his name was <unk> , and it was an Italian @-@ American named <unk> , and obviously his name was so hard that he could call him &quot; P , &quot; or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and P physicians always carry a <unk> and <unk> , and he was very well @-@ educated with his kids .
in addition to training courses , I spent a lot of time in his hospitals .
I &apos;m going to do two @-@ way , three @-@ dimensional , colorful , flexible tape that I &apos;m going to do over and over again on my legs , and I &apos;m going to take those pieces of string , and I even give them names .
I was a five @-@ year @-@ old kid , and I asked him to stop me from letting me do it again , and of course I didn &apos;t do it .
and one day , P &amp; amp ; quot ; So when I was doing my <unk> , I was like , you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and he said to me , Amy , you &apos;re a tough girl , and I felt like you could pull this tape out .
when you broke it , I offered you 100 dollars .
obviously , this was a trick at P &amp; amp ; quot ; So it was just a trick of trying to get me to do all of these things that I didn &apos;t love to do , and it was going to be the richest people in the first five @-@ year @-@ olds , but P @-@ A @-@ <unk> did something that I hate to translate as a new , fresh , fresh , fresh , fresh , fresh , or something .
today , I &apos;m often thinking about how powerful my own version of this university doctor , P @-@ A doctors and my strong young girl , strong young girl , is so big in my own self @-@ aware , and now I can see that my inherent reality is <unk> , my future is bright .
and this is a very good example of a P doctor , which suggests that an adult with power can light a child &apos;s potential .
but in the case of the <unk> dictionaries , our language does not allow us to take what we want to see and turn it into reality and not allow the disabled to recognize that they are actually capable of being capable .
the technology is bringing social development , and our language is not as social as we speak .
of course , from the medical point of medicine , my fake legs , repair my vision , <unk> titanium , provide a replacement for the elderly , all of these technologies , to allow people to be more fully functional , and <unk> them to the natural world , to allow them to be connected to the rest of our community .
so technology is clearly showing us a permanent truth , which is that every one of us is very powerful , and it is the ability to contribute to society and to adapt to our world &apos;s greatest capital .
it &apos;s interesting to talk about human universals , because people often want to get me through the topic that I want to talk about today , and I want to make a little bit of an argument about how we can get from adversity from adversity , and I don &apos;t even begin to say something like that .
and the idea of separation from adversity from adversity is that it &apos;s a sign of success , or pleasure , at the other end of a difficult experience , but it &apos;s not about success and pleasure , as if by the way , my life has succeeded because I &apos;ve been around as a series of challenges that I &apos;ve seen as an <unk> of other people .
but in fact , these challenges really changed us , and the quality of life on our journey has revealed that this transformation could be the body , possibly the spirit , could be both of those .
what I want to suggest is that the challenges are good .
in the face of adversity , we shouldn &apos;t think of it as obstacles to continuing our lives .
in fact , adversity is part of our lives .
I imagined adversity as my own shadow .
sometimes it looks big , sometimes it &apos;s very small , but it &apos;s still around me .
of course , I &apos;m not trying to <unk> people &apos;s values and beliefs about <unk> and <unk> .
we &apos;re destined to be <unk> and challenging all of us in our lifetime , but we &apos;re not asking whether or not you want to go to the <unk> , but to see it .
so our responsibility is not simply to simply let people care about our lives in the fields of worship , but to make them <unk> out of adversity .
we actually hurts them when we let them feel we don &apos;t have the skills we have .
the objective of medicine , to determine whether I &apos;m a disabled person , to think about whether I &apos;m a disabled person , is there a difference between these two things .
in fact , one of the only problems I had to deal with was the world &apos;s understanding and description of each other .
we want to be able to protect the people we care about , the cold @-@ hearted diagnose them or sometimes , to make predictions for their future lives , but we have to pay attention to whether or not we can destroy these people .
perhaps , people are used to focus only on their flaws , and to think about how to repair those limitations , to the physical disability of the disabled .
we don &apos;t see disabled people in a whole way , we don &apos;t recognize them , and it &apos;s a very difficult situation for them .
we can actually measure the value of a society based on the value of one person .
so our eyes shouldn &apos;t be limited to the <unk> of the disabled , but they should be aware of their value as human beings .
in addition , some of the most important hurdles , some of the deepest qualities of the disabled , among the human creativity .
so , the tough years of suffering is not something that shouldn &apos;t be <unk> or <unk> , and it &apos;s not something that we should eradicate or hide , in the opposite case , we should seek opportunities in adversity .
in fact , the reason I want to tell you about this is that adversity is not something that has to do with overcoming it , but we should be able to embrace it and embrace it , and I used a term called <unk> , or even dance .
perhaps , if we could look at adversity as something that is natural , self @-@ sustaining , human or human , it could no longer afford us .
this year , we celebrated the 200 anniversary of Darwin , and when Darwin writes about the evolution of the species 150 years ago , he illustrates the truths of the human species .
and the phrase that he said probably meant that the species that were surviving were not the strongest , not the smartest , but the outside environment .
conflict is the mother of creation .
Darwin and others like yourselves have revealed that this transformation of human nature after a huge while of having a huge amount of fear .
and again , the greatest human ability , I think , is transformation and adapted .
maybe , before we get too far , we don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is what will happen in adversity , a sense of self and individual ability .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of adversity as an opportunity to change .
it wasn &apos;t a difficult time .
adversity is a change , and we don &apos;t have time to cope with it .
and I think the biggest dilemma that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this notion of &quot; liberty . &quot;
okay , what is the state of <unk> ?
there is no justice in the form of <unk> .
I know what it is , what it is , what it is , what it is , what is a typical <unk> , but I don &apos;t know what it is , if there are those kind of poor , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re interested in ?
I don &apos;t think so .
if we don &apos;t invest our energy in the pursuit of <unk> , we invest in different possibilities , we invest in different possibilities , we take out the potential of many children , and we start to motivate them to value their communities , they become unique .
and anthropologists tell us that as humans , we always hope that the people in our communities are useful to contribute .
the Neanderthals , around 60,000 years ago , were a pretty good proof that Neanderthals were producing in their society , because they believed that older people were more likely to live , and that the society was valuable .
older people will never be treated as useless , but they &apos;re considered as valuable .
and one day a few years ago , I was in my hometown of <unk> , Pennsylvania , the <unk> <unk> <unk> next to me .
because it was summer , I was wearing shorts .
I came up with a man &apos;s voice in behind me , but isn &apos;t it Amy <unk> ?
and I turned around , and I realized that I had no idea .
and I said , &quot; Mr. <unk> excuse me . have we met ? I &apos;ve forgotten you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; Well , you don &apos;t remember the meeting we met . &quot;
because at the time , I was <unk> you out of your mother &apos;s uterus .
that &apos;s what I met .
and of course , I thought , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this man was a doctor , and I only knew that I was told by my mother that I was a very late night .
and at the time that my mother was taking care of her doctor &apos;s shop , she was on vacation , so she ended up being a doctor and a woman that I hadn &apos;t known before .
when I was born , there were none of my <unk> , my feet , and Father <unk> , he had to convey two bad things .
and he said to me , &quot; I told you the diagnosis of my parents , and I said , &quot; You &apos;re never going to walk , you &apos;re never going to walk like any other child , you &apos;re going to be able to live forever , but ever since then , you &apos;ve made me a life @-@ free . &quot;
and one of the great things Father <unk> , he started cutting out all of my childhood stories , including myself , when I was in second grade , when I was in a graduate student , and then I was on a tour with all of my students , and I was able to do this with all the stories of my students &apos; campus , and my students &apos; campus .
he called me the story of the X factor in his curriculum called the potential of the human mind .
there &apos;s no medical diagnostic to explain how powerful this will be , how powerful will it affect the quality of a human being ?
and Troy went on to me , and he said , &quot; But there &apos;s a lot of other people argue about me , and there &apos;s a lot of other things I can do about it , and there &apos;s a lot of support for kids , and there &apos;s a lot of them .
see , the doctor &apos;s mind changed .
he realized that there was a difference between the medical diagnosis and the way a person dealt with it .
and a few years later , I thought there was a shift , like , if you were 15 years old , asking me if I would like to use my current prosthetic arm , if I had a different prosthetic arm .
because I wanted to get that kind of <unk> .
but if you ask me the same question today , I &apos;m just going to leave you alone .
and that &apos;s because the experience that I use my arm has a lot of implications to me .
maybe I &apos;ve got a little bit out of my gut on the inside of me because , in the people I met , I opened up the door to the new door , far more than the people in my soul .
see , what you need is a person who can show you your strength .
the human spirit is embracing , and if you can give somebody another keys , make him use this keys , and at the moment the key , you can turn the keys to somebody else , and you can open the door in the best way to education .
because you &apos;re teaching them to open up the door to the new world .
and in fact , what that word means for education is that it comes from the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a deep sense of the potential that lies within it .
so , what are the potential for generating capability ?
there &apos;s a case in the 1960s where children from primary school to junior high school .
in the U.K. , there &apos;s a guy called <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we call it the <unk> Survey .
the exam students were divided by line A , B , C and D .
there &apos;s a better teacher , etc .
this was a three @-@ month @-@ old trial where they were told to be A @-@ B @-@ waiting students , they were told they were brilliant , three months at the end of the trial , and this was the same thing as A student .
and of course , there &apos;s a flip side to this study , and that is , you know , the people who are supposed to be on the top are told they &apos;re D @-@ C @-@ D students .
three months of experiments ended .
many of them have dropped out .
and one of the key points for this experiment was that the teachers who participated were not aware of .
the teachers didn &apos;t know they were lying .
the teachers were just told which A @-@ T @-@ shirts , and that &apos;s what we call a &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , I think the real disability of disability is a soul that has been beaten , a soul that has no hope for the future , a soul that has no ability to perceive , a soul that has lost our imagination .
and if we can get the human spirit out there , hope that the soul can see ourselves and the beauty of others , and the imagination and the imagination , then we can even use our own forces .
as long as a soul still has those qualities , it can create endless possibilities and new ways of life .
I want to leave you with a poem by a poet named <unk> <unk> , who was one of my friends , Jacques <unk> , who was telling me his name , &quot; A god only knows four words , &quot; each child knows that God doesn &apos;t exist in four words , but rather than four .
dancing with me . thank you .
and I want you to imagine a wearable robot that could give you a superhero , or maybe a wheelchair of users moving again .
we call these robots in Berkeley .
there &apos;s nothing else you can do in the morning , and it &apos;s going to give you an extra amount of power , and it &apos;s going to give you a little bit of control .
it actually <unk> people and machines .
but not only that -- it &apos;s going to combine and connect you with the outside world , connecting to other devices .
it wasn &apos;t just the slightest idea .
to show you what we &apos;re doing right now , we &apos;re talking about American soldiers , and they &apos;re about 100 pounds of weight on the back , and they &apos;re asked to carry more .
obviously , this leads to problems with spinal cord injury -- 30 percent of soldiers with back @-@ to @-@ injury -- chronic back injury .
so we thought we should face this challenge and create an exoskeleton to help solve this problem .
so let me tell you a little bit about <unk> -- that &apos;s human loads .
soldiers : after I had <unk> body exoskeletons , I could carry over 200 pounds of walking in complex terrain .
it &apos;s flexible ; it &apos;s able to get people to go deep and high @-@ capacity .
it feels what I want to do , where I want to go , and I can lift my strength and my strength .
<unk> <unk> : our partner and our industry are ready to introduce this , and we introduced this new animal this year .
this is real .
now let &apos;s turn to the wheelchair itself , and this is a very personal part .
there are estimated to be 55 million users in the world .
that &apos;s about one percent of the population .
this is a conservative estimate .
what we &apos;re going to say now is that the very young people who have spinal cord injuries are going to be dying -- 20 , 30 years old , 40 years old -- that touch a wheelchair is the only choice .
and it also enabled this number to double .
and the only choice , roughly -- when someone has a stroke or something else -- is a wheelchair .
it &apos;s actually been shown recently 500 years ago , and this is a very successful introduction , and I have to say .
so I think we have to start writing new songs , new stories .
now let me introduce you to the <unk> , which is Amanda <unk> , who was subjected to a spinal cord injury 19 years ago , and that led her over 19 years to not walk , until now .
Amanda Kitts : thank you .
LM : I said , what Amanda wearing is our <unk> .
it has a transducer .
in these support of a completely non @-@ invasive sensor , they send signals to the back of her back .
and there &apos;s a battery pack , and there &apos;s a motor vehicle in her butt , including her <unk> motor vehicle , which allows her to move as a <unk> pace .
Amanda : I was the pinnacle of my life at the age of 24 , when I fell asleep and fell asleep , and I was paralyzed .
and in that moment , I lost all the sense and the ability of the pelvis .
shortly after a doctor comes into my ward and says to me , &quot; Amanda , you can &apos;t walk anymore . &quot;
that was 19 years ago .
he deprive me of hope .
I &apos;ve been able to learn how to ski again , climb rocks , even hand @-@ <unk> .
but there was nothing that made me walk , until now .
thank you .
<unk> : as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down , and this has talked to you about .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential , to change our children &apos;s lives -- not just for soldiers , but for <unk> and for every human being .
Amanda : thank you .
in New York , I &apos;m the head of the nonprofit sector .
I was also very disturbed by the idea of how much I would be , in the process of setting up the conductor .
in our little town , in a place where volunteers have been successful , you have to go very early to where you &apos;ve got to go .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunteer in the field , and it was possible for me to go to the island .
but you also have to win the rest of the volunteers , first of all , to get the job done to you .
and when I got to the end of the conflict , he was <unk> and <unk> talking about her , obviously , the worst day of life .
it was <unk> , and she was standing in her pajamas , <unk> , <unk> , and her house was hanging down .
another volunteer named him after I got to the start of the year was called , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; and he was distributed to kill the puppy dog .
<unk> ! I was so jealous .
it was a lawyer or a <unk> for the rest of life to tell people that he went deep , and he was a living dog , because he was more than me .
okay , here I am .
voice 16 : my father .
and he said , &quot; <unk> . I need you to <unk> .
I want you to go upstairs , and I want you to take a <unk> for this woman . &quot;
I swear .
this is not the image I &apos;ve described in my mind , but I went upstairs , and I walked up to the bottom , and I went through the &quot; actual <unk> , &quot; and they basically pulled the fire out , and I walked in , and I took a pair of shoes .
I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m not a hero .
I took my mission down to the front door , and I met this guy who was the one I met earlier , Mr. and the dog that he had .
we walked to the front door with our <unk> , and he was far more concerned than I had .
a few weeks later , we got a letter from <unk> , and thank you for saving her family .
and she talked specifically about this little , fuzzy details , and somebody brought a pair of shoes to her .
whether I &apos;m doing &quot; <unk> , &quot; or me as a volunteer defense , I saw a lot of very generous work , and I also saw how different the courage and compassion would be .
you know what I learned ?
they &apos;re all equally important .
when I look around , people who succeed or are about to succeed , you have these amazing things that I want to remind you : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for your first million to start changing lives .
if you &apos;ve got something to give it to the present , it &apos;s time to pay .
it doesn &apos;t feed the poor .
be a model .
not every single day , we have the opportunity to save lives , but every day we have a chance to affect the lives of others .
here we go .
thank you .
Miguel , thank you .
thank you .
I had just come back from a community that had some secret about human survival .
in this community , women &apos;s dominant , have to have sex with each other , and play is one of the things that play is all day -- that play is serious .
no , it &apos;s not just men burning burn , it &apos;s not San Francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your close relatives .
this is the world of bonobos , because of the bonobos in Congo .
the bonobos are particularly closely related to the bonobos .
that means that we all share a common ancestry , a grandmother whose life was around about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are dying for their females .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve been <unk> by this idea of evolutionary history .
but the bonobos show us the flip side of the coin .
when the chimps are dominated by the bonobos .
the bonobos are so eager to live together , and that led to a highly inclusive society , where lethal violence has not yet been viewed .
but unfortunately , the bonobos are one of the most known of all known as <unk> .
they live deep inside the jungles of the Congo , so it &apos;s very difficult for them to study it .
Congo is an extraordinary cultural biodiversity and beautiful land in Congo , but she &apos;s also a dark and violent scene that has lasted decades as much as World War I.
and it &apos;s not surprising that this damage was also a life @-@ threatening leader .
the business of meat and the forest was simply disappearing , and it was meant that we couldn &apos;t give a small habitat for the rest of the world if we didn &apos;t even know if there was a smaller habitat .
and yet , in this wild and chaotic land , you can hear <unk> dancing in trees .
what are these close relatives ?
we know that they are &quot; have sex , don &apos;t have war , &quot; so they have frequent , casual sex and <unk> to deal with conflict and social problems .
now I &apos;m not suggesting that this is the way to cope with all of the problems of human problems -- because play is more <unk> for a chimpanzee than a chimpanzee .
the bonobos are like humans , and they love play throughout their lifetime .
play is not just a child &apos;s game .
for those of us who are right now , play is the basis of intimacy and nurturing .
it also allows us to learn about trust and play .
it &apos;s a culture of creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about diversity -- the dynamics of diversity , the dynamics of diversity , the connectivity of diversity .
when you look at the <unk> of the bonobos , you see the very evolutionary roots of the human species , dance and rituals .
play is what makes us connected .
now I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you two clips from just wild to special .
first of all , this is a pair of <unk> -- I don &apos;t mean soccer .
here , the two young females are playing the game .
look what she &apos;s doing .
that &apos;s the phrase &quot; The Origin of Species , &quot; the origin of the phrase .
I just thought he liked it , right .
yes .
so it &apos;s a very common thing to do with the bonobos .
and this is really interesting because it turns out -- this video is really interesting because it shows the creativity that brings things out in the game -- like the <unk> -- how game can seek trust and nurture -- at the same time , at the same time , infinity .
but play is a <unk> process .
play is a <unk> process , and it can become many games , some games that are quiet , imagination , imagination -- perhaps magic of play .
and I want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female chimpanzee who is playing with water .
and I think , like her , we &apos;re sometimes practicing alone , and we &apos;re exploring the boundaries of our own inner world .
it &apos;s the <unk> of play that motivates us to explore , to drive us to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we &apos;ve created are really the breeding ground for creativity .
so these are just images of the bonobos that have been given to us by the bonobos .
but they also have a secret to our future , and in the future we need to embrace an increasingly challenging world that has never been creative and collaborative to do it .
the secret is that play is essential for all of these things .
in other words , play is the universal translator of the future .
in order to succeed , we need play .
but are we going to play as much as we can ?
play is not insignificant .
play is essential .
for the bonobos , it &apos;s not just about the teeth and the teeth .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> appropriate to play , but it &apos;s probably the most demanding of play .
well , my own primates , we embrace the gift of a gift that we play with each other , and that brings us back to the realization , the relationship and wonder .
thank you .
and I want you to think about the same day that married couples have given the same day in 1979 , the same moment that every single moment had a child ...
and then the first couple of weeks , they all came to a child .
now , I don &apos;t want you all to spend a lot of time thinking about pregnancy because if you spend a lot of time thinking about it , you don &apos;t hear it .
so think about it a little bit .
so in this case , I &apos;m going to try to imagine , the sperm that carry the Y @-@ chromosome with the X @-@ chromosome .
the other one is the sperm that carried the X chromosome with the X chromosome .
both of them survived , and both of them started to grow .
let &apos;s take a look at this .
I became the two characters in my field .
one of the roles was my anatomy .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and what I study is how humans respond to anatomy -- either human body or animal bodies -- how they deal with body fluids , abstract body fluids , and how they think about bodies .
another role is , as an activist , as a role for the patient -- or , as I say , as a doctor , as a doctor &apos;s office -- I &apos;m pretty radical .
so what I &apos;ve been exposed to in my work is some of the challenges that face us .
for example , some of the people I met were <unk> , two of whom shared a body .
some of them are called <unk> , and they &apos;re much more effective than people .
in addition , a lot of the people I meet are different from their gender @-@ specific -- the fact that they don &apos;t have a standard male feature or female signature .
in general , the symptoms can be called <unk> .
there are many different forms .
let me give you just a couple of examples where you can either be a non @-@ standard male feature or a standard female .
one example of one could have a <unk> genome , and the <unk> genome on the Y chromosome , the <unk> chromosome , the raw ingredients that we had at the time of the fetus , which made it into the testicles .
so during the baby period , the testicles are hormone .
but this individual is missing receptors , and the body is not reacting to the testicles , the hormone .
this is a disorder called the <unk> .
so there &apos;s a lot of testosterone , but you can &apos;t get a response .
so the body moves toward a female trend .
when the baby was born , she looked like a girl .
she was the girl , and she was treated as a young girl .
most of the time , until puberty started to grow , she didn &apos;t have women &apos;s cycles , and we started to wonder what was going on .
so they looked at her , and they found that she didn &apos;t have any ovaries and actually , inside her body , and she carried the Y chromosome .
now , one of the big questions that I want to suggest to you is that this guy is actually not .
women , like men , have a organ that &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s in the back of our body .
and testosterone is responsible for a male hormone .
like most women like me -- I believe I &apos;m a pretty typical woman -- I don &apos;t know what my chromosomes are , but I think I should be a typical woman -- most women , like me , are actually a sensitive woman .
we gut testosterone , and we respond to it .
as a result , there were women like me , and the brain exposed more testosterone than there was when she was born .
so gender is a very complex thing ; it &apos;s not just that those who are standing between men and women -- in some ways , they can cover the whole range of characteristics .
another couple of years ago , when I was born with this old boy called <unk> , he was a boy , and he was brought in as a boy , and she had a girlfriend , and he had a life of having sex with his girlfriend , but recently , he found himself in her body .
all he had was a very extreme situation called <unk> : 21 <unk> disorder .
he carried <unk> chromosomes , and he was active in the womb , and it became a male hormone .
and as a result , he developed male genital female genital tissue , a more typical male egg .
so he was born and looked like a boy -- no one had any doubts .
and only when he got to age 19 , when he got to the biology problem , he actually got period in the body , and he realized that , in fact , he was female .
all right , let &apos;s take a quick look at another example of what could possibly be sexual .
some of you have four chromosomes that develop a kind of organ called <unk> , which is a kind of organ , which is a dental tissue that is released from the testicles .
we don &apos;t know what it is .
so gender can be pretty hot .
the children with these physical traits -- whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> -- are often the reason why the surgeons are <unk> -- are actually not healthy .
because in many cases , their bodies were healthy .
and the reason they have all kinds of surgery is because they are threatened by our society .
or there &apos;s a typical structure of the body , or what characteristics there are .
so the idea is that as a woman , we have to have the characteristics of women , and so on and so forth , a black person has to live in your <unk> .
so we had this very simple recognition .
and when we &apos;re faced with something different , the ideas that we can &apos;t categorize , they &apos;re shocking .
so a lot of our culture is really the idea of being <unk> .
and our country built in a very unusual concept of <unk> .
okay , so you can imagine how astonishing it was when your two children were born .
I recently met this situation where Africa was , last year , at the time of last year , at the time of <unk> <unk> , was asked by <unk> in the competition in Berlin .
a lot of reporters called me and ask me , &quot; What kind of test would they use to show you <unk> or <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
so I had to explain to them , there was no way to test .
in fact , we now know that gender is complicated , we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have a clear line between male or female or female or male or female or female lines , and that line is actually our own painting .
so the more we are right now , the more science we have today , the more we recognize these gender @-@ based patterns , the more we take for granted , the more we take for granted than the fact that we can imagine .
and it &apos;s not just about gender issues .
and it &apos;s also about the issues of race , and the complexity of our academic competence is not the description of our subject .
as we can see , we have all kinds of hard work .
let &apos;s take an example , and the reality is that we compare the DNA of 95 percent of humanity with gorilla .
and the fact is that human and gorilla are just different from some of the DNA .
the more technologies we have , the more we have , the more technology we have , the more we have to admit , are simply too simplistic .
and that &apos;s because of that , we &apos;re looking at the whole field of life .
one area , for example , is our cultural field , where the culture of the United States today has its origins and its end .
we had a tough conversation about when we went from one body to another , and we had a different human right to the baby .
we have a very controversial issue today -- maybe even beyond the domain of medicine -- which is the question of when to consider death .
in the old days , our ancestors never crossed the line of life .
most of all , it &apos;s the ability to stick a feather under the nose of somebody &apos;s nose , and if the feathers are gone , people aren &apos;t going to move them .
if the feathers don &apos;t move , they will bury themselves .
but what &apos;s happening now is that we want to take the organ of the dead and transplant it to everybody else .
and as a result , we started asking questions about what was going on there , and it was really difficult to get us into a situation where there was no simple <unk> .
now you might think , well , all of these categories of things that are going to collapse , and maybe they &apos;re going to be great for people like me .
I was a man who lived in politics , and I had to acknowledge that it was a very disturbing time .
realizing that these institutions are more unstable than we think , made me nervous .
at the same time , my tensions came from democratic perspective .
so to tell you this level of intense tension , I want to admit that I &apos;m a big fan of all the <unk> .
I know they &apos;re racist . they &apos;re <unk> , but they &apos;re great .
I mean , they &apos;re so heroic , fearless and committed to doing their own work , and I have to rethink my own experience every few years .
it was because of what was happening around the world .
the people who founded it , I think , are the first people to do it .
they were against the concept of a anatomy , and they were using a concept of another two years .
when you think about our ultimate selves , what we call an idea of a constitutional institution , and this monarchy was based on the idea of simplicity .
the monarchs of the old systems didn &apos;t have the concepts of DNA , but they were following the idea of &quot; birth . &quot;
they have concepts of aristocracy .
they said , &quot; The people in politics should be remembered by the <unk> , from the soul to the father . &quot;
and the idea that the leaders were against this idea , they were using a new kind of anatomy , and that was the idea of <unk> .
they were missing the hierarchy of ideas , and they were sure that the anatomy of the human form was an artifact , and it was really a radical innovation .
and in a way , it &apos;s still happening now , because they &apos;re part of the first Enlightenment system , two things are common .
democratic institutions were being formed , but they were also technological .
and what &apos;s really striking is that , if you look at the history of the people who are the leaders who are interested in science and they &apos;re all interested in the world .
they dismiss the supernatural ideas of supernatural power , because of the idea of supernatural power , based on very blurry ideas .
they advocate for concept of <unk> .
if you look at it , for example , in the Declaration of Independence , they talk about natural and natural God .
they didn &apos;t mention the nature of God and God .
they mentioned the power of nature to explain who we are .
so as part of this , they bring us an idea of what it means to be human life , to equal equality .
and they really prepared a great road for the future of the Civil Rights Movement .
they had no idea what was going to happen , but they set us up , and that was great .
so what happened a few years later ?
for example , what happens to women in women , what they want to vote for , what they want to do is to say , &quot; We have <unk> and <unk> , &quot; which means that we don &apos;t have a free vote , we don &apos;t have private property rights , etc . &quot;
the women &apos;s cause the results .
and the next thing that happened was that the Civil Rights Movement had come up with people like <unk> <unk> , who said , &quot; Am I a woman ? &quot;
we know that the man had a great quote from the Civil Rights Movement .
in addition , the urge to <unk> is not to racism .
we see the same success cases where people are <unk> .
the problem is , of course , when we started to look at all the citizens , we had to start asking questions about why we could keep a static line .
now , what I want to remind you is that I want to maintain some of the boundaries of the body , within our culture .
for example , I don &apos;t want to give fish the same rights as humans .
I don &apos;t want us to give up any anatomical distinction .
I don &apos;t want to have children that can be allowed to have sexual activity , or to be married .
so there &apos;s some line of anatomy , and there &apos;s meaning to us , I think , that should be kept .
but the challenge here is to try and figure out why we should preserve them , what they mean .
so , let &apos;s go back to what we &apos;ve been talking about , which is the first two people to make the session .
we had <unk> and we were pregnant on the same day in 1979 .
let &apos;s see , Mary was born three months earlier , so she was born on June 1 , 1980 .
Henry , on the contrary , his foot was born in October of 1980 .
it was just three months before Mary was born , and she was able to get all sorts of rights , and she was able to allow the right to have sexual rights , drinking right ?
and Henry had to wait for his physiology , not because of the different times he was born .
we also found other incredible rights problems .
you know , Henry &apos;s been granted to a male -- although I haven &apos;t told you , he &apos;s a <unk> genome -- because it &apos;s been hypothesized to be a man , you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
at the same time , Mary couldn &apos;t enjoy the same state as Henry , the same rights , the right to marry .
Henry could get married in any state , but Mary could only marry a few states today .
so some of the organisms that we insisted on , they have problems in many ways , and they need to question .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do when our science is so advanced , that we have to admit that the democracy on our anatomy may collapse ?
I don &apos;t want to lose hope for science , but at the same time , it &apos;s kind of <unk> that we have .
so where do we go ?
it looks like our society has a utilitarian attitude : &quot; well , I have to draw a boundary somewhere , and I &apos;m standing in a line . &quot;
but a lot of people get a very embarrassing place .
for example , Texas has a decision to marry a man that says you don &apos;t have Y chromosomes , and if you marry a woman , you have Y chromosomes .
in reality , they don &apos;t actually test the chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also strange , because I started telling you about the story of non @-@ sensitive PMS .
we looked at one of the founders of modern democracies , Martin Luther King , in his &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech , gave us a solution .
he said , &quot; We should not judge a man based on a man &apos;s skin , but based on his <unk> . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Yeah , that sounds like a good way . &quot;
but how do you do it in practice ?
how do you judge him in his favor ?
and I also wanted to point out that I wasn &apos;t sure that we should distribute human rights , because I had to acknowledge that some of the gold <unk> seemed to be more useful than some of the people I knew were .
I also want to say that I know that some <unk> seem to be a little bit more <unk> than 40 @-@ year @-@ olds in sex , more smart , more mature decision .
so how do we measure that ?
and it turns out to be very difficult .
and I also wanted to know that if it &apos;s good or worse , it could be scanned in the future -- maybe MRI ?
do we really want to get there ?
I &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what I know is that it &apos;s important to think about the problem of democracy in the United States .
we &apos;re doing it very well for the issue of democracy , and I think it &apos;s going to be better .
we are different from Iran , like a man who has a sexual attraction to other men , so he can be killed unless he wants to change his own sexuality .
we didn &apos;t have that .
and I &apos;m very happy to say that we don &apos;t have that -- to a surgeon , that was to say that a couple of years ago , he brought in a class of people who wanted to be able to help them separate , and to sort of make them famous .
but when I asked him why he wanted to do this surgery -- because it was a high @-@ risk surgery -- he said , in this country , kids like this will be cruel , so he has to help them .
and I said to him , &quot; Well , do you think about <unk> , rather than surgery ? &quot;
the United States provides a lot of their own characteristics for kids like this , and they may not have to change their body .
so I think we should be leading this idea .
well , by the way , I want to remind you that I &apos;ve talked a lot about what was going on .
I also wanted to think about what democracy would look like , or what it would look like if we could get more mothers to participate .
and I also want to say that a little bit more radical about the idea of a feminist , which is that I think different people might be able to bring different perspectives , particularly when we &apos;re used to thinking .
and I &apos;ve been interested in the differences between the sexes for many years .
one of the things I &apos;m really interested in is to look at the differences between men and women in the world .
we know from a cross @-@ cultural study that women , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- but rather more likely to be aware of complex social relations , more caring for the vulnerable of the elderly .
so if we think of it this way , we find an interesting situation .
a couple of years ago , when I was in graduate school , one of my senior friends knew that I was interested in -- I was a feminist writer who always asked me a weird question .
he said , &quot; Tell me where the feminism is . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s the most profound question I &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is the basis of everything that <unk> desire , and therefore , feminism is not harmful .
but what I wanted to do was to look at the problem , and more of all , I think , that maybe the feminist has a little bit of a feminine problem .
that is to say , maybe there are a few , many women &apos;s minds that are different from the men , and we are more likely to be more interested in complex social relations and more concerned about the vulnerable .
but the first thing that people had heard about was how to protect each other &apos;s borders , and if we put it in this concept of <unk> , we would have more than one concept , more than just how to protect each other .
maybe that &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to go in the future , and when we take away from the human population , let &apos;s say democracy -- that &apos;s less about the individual identity of the individual , but more about the human relationship .
so when people are trying to create a better industrial complex , what we need to think about is what we do for other people .
thank you .
I &apos;m Jesse , and this is my pretend .
but when I showed you what I had put in there , I had to do a very open , very open @-@ ended , which was that I was obsessed with clothing .
I was looking for them and wearing them , and recently , I love taking pictures of them and blog about them , each of them has a unique , colorful clothing , the most appropriate place .
but I didn &apos;t buy anything new .
my clothes were bought from <unk> and <unk> .
Oh , thank you .
shopping allows me to reduce the impact of clothing , and the impact of my purse .
I could meet all sorts of interesting people ; I could save the money ; I was dressed as a <unk> ; and also , shopping became my private property .
and I thought , what would I find today ?
would that be my size ?
is it my favorite color ?
would you be below 20 dollars ?
if the answer is yes , I feel like I win .
and I want to go back to my <unk> and tell you what I &apos;ve been carrying for a very exciting week at TED .
what is this guy carrying ?
so I &apos;m going to show you what I took .
and I took all of that .
the first week of the week was everything in my mind .
I would make a bet that I would find all the clothes I needed .
since you see me now , not the woman in my underwear &quot; -- which suggests that I actually found something new .
and now I really want to show you my week of clothing .
does it sound good ?
and of course , I &apos;m also going to talk to you about the director of my life , whether you believe it or not , these are the ideas I &apos;ve been <unk> in &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so we started Sunday .
my name is &quot; Tiger . &quot;
you don &apos;t need to be charismatic .
you can almost make it for less than 50 dollars .
this whole suit , including the coat of a cotton suit , was the most expensive clothing I could wear .
Monday : color is powerful .
in biology , it &apos;s almost impossible to wear bright red pants on a bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other people to be happy .
the dominant one : it &apos;s way below Tuesday .
I spent a lot of my life trying to do myself , and I went into the mainstream .
you do it yourself .
if you have the right people around you , they will not only understand , they will enjoy it .
Wednesday : embracing your <unk> .
some people tell me , I &apos;m dressed , or I remind them of their seven @-@ year @-@ olds .
I liked to smile and said , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
eyewitness confidence is key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good , you &apos;re going to be looking pretty good .
if you don &apos;t think you &apos;re looking good , you &apos;re pretty sure .
growing up , my mom told me this every day .
but I was 30 years old and knew what that meant .
and I &apos;m going to give you a quick analysis .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person , <unk> , there &apos;s no clothes you can &apos;t wear .
so none of you have any reason .
we can wear what we want to wear .
thank you .
Friday : a pervasive truth -- a few words to you : gold <unk> .
and finally , Saturday . it &apos;s really a great way to tell the world who you are , and you don &apos;t have to say anything .
it &apos;s time for me to prove that this week when people come to me , it &apos;s just because of what I wear . we have a great conversation .
and of course , the clothes didn &apos;t break into my <unk> .
so before I got back to Brooklyn , I was going to break everything down .
because this week I was teaching myself to let go .
I don &apos;t need to be <unk> , because in the next corner , there &apos;s going to be a crazy set of clothes that would sort of wrap up in front of me just looking for love .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon .
I have something I want to show you .
think of this as a pixel , a flight pixels .
we call it <unk> in the lab .
let me introduce you to this .
now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian , every Italian boy in Italy has this photograph of them growing up with them , but I &apos;ll show you why some of the interesting things happened in the last few decades .
in the old days , if you wanted to have a <unk> budget , you just had to have a budget , and you took your budget and you put it in a good <unk> and a car .
if your car is good enough enough , you &apos;re going to get it .
now , if you want to take a look , you actually need a couple of other things like this -- some of the real @-@ time detection devices that connect with thousands of sensors that can actually gather around the vehicle , deliver them into the system , and process them to actually use this to actually try to get the information about how to do it .
this is what engineers call a real @-@ time surveillance system .
basically , this system includes two components , one which is a driver .
now , what &apos;s interesting about this is that the real @-@ time surveillance system is starting to absorb our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , have been covered by networks , by electronic industry .
it became wireless and closed .
at the same time , as a wireless and closed computer , they started responding to sensing and <unk> .
if we can optimize the city , it &apos;s actually a leap .
in my own opinion , I would like to suggest that cities only two percent of the Earth &apos;s surface , but they represent 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
their energy consumption is 75 percent of the world &apos;s energy consumption -- 80 percent of the CO2 emission .
so if we optimize the city , it &apos;s going to be a flying .
in these cities , all these sensing and <unk> are entering into our daily lives .
this is an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
the topic is &quot; talking to me . &quot;
our environment , our environment , is beginning to give feedback .
in a sense , like every atom is turning into sensors and <unk> .
and it fundamentally changed our relationship to nature .
and in a sense , it was an ancient dream .
you know , when Moses was like Moses , like Moses , at the end of the day , he got a <unk> , threw it into Moses , like -- you see the little <unk> at the bottom -- saying , &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re talking to the <unk> , why ? &quot;
today , for the first time , our environment started giving us feedback .
and I &apos;m going to show you just a few cases -- one time , responding to our consciousness and responding to our environment .
let &apos;s start with sensing .
the first project I want to share with you is actually one of the first few projects in our lab .
that was in Italy six months ago .
what we were doing there was actually using a new network of networks that were already covered in the world -- mobile phone networks , collected by this network of information about how the city was produced .
the summer was a very lucky summer -- 2006 .
this is the year the Italian World Cup <unk> .
some of you may remember that the Italian race was a great deal to French , and that wasn &apos;t enough .
anyway , Italy won .
now let &apos;s take a look at what happened that day and then use the grid to actually demonstrate what happened in real time .
you see the city now .
you see the big Rome <unk> , the <unk> .
this is the morning , before the match .
you look at the timeline .
and at noon , the people in this room were walking .
the game started -- silence .
<unk> . Italy .
everybody quickly ordered a call , went to a toilet .
the game ended .
the first one , the second one .
when the horse came to mind .
Italy wins . ha .
that night , everybody went to the inner city celebration .
you can see rush hour .
the next day , everybody went to the inner city center and the prime minister .
and then he would turn back .
you see this place called the <unk> <unk> , which started in Rome , and people were celebrating there -- there was a great party at the end of the day .
this is just one example of how we now perceive this city in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
another quick example of perception is not about people this time , but about things we use and consumed .
today , we know where everything comes from .
this is a map showing you all the <unk> of a Mac computer , how to assemble .
but we had very few things to know where the last dog is .
so this project , we actually developed some small tags to track the waste from the system .
in fact , we worked with some volunteers in Seattle who were willing to help us , just a year ago , to give us things that people have thrown away -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that we just throw away .
we take the little <unk> , the little tags , and we start tracking them on the garbage and we start tracking them .
this is what we see .
from Seattle ...
a week later .
and we learned that there &apos;s a lot of effectiveness in the system .
I actually do the same thing with less energy .
this data was not available .
but there &apos;s a lot of waste and complexity happening .
there &apos;s another thing that we believe that if we want the cups that we take away every day , it doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on Earth .
we &apos;d drop it every day .
if we show this to people , then we can also encourage some changes in behavior .
so that &apos;s what this project meant .
I &apos;m at MIT , and Peter <unk> , who will tell you a lot more about perception and a lot of the amazing things we can do , but I want to start with the second part , which is actually about our environment .
the first project was done a couple of years ago in Spain .
it started by asking a question that the mayor of the mayor , who came to us and said that Spain was so traditional in southern Europe , in public water .
the question is , how can technology make it cool ?
one of the ideas that came from a research group at MIT was about , you know , imagine a pipe , and you have the valves , the kidney chemistry , and you basically turn on and off .
you create a quality of water as pixels .
if the pixels leave , you can create it on it , you can show the pixels , the text .
and when you get close to it , it even turns off to allow you to jump , as you can see here .
we showed this to the mayor of <unk> .
he loved it .
and then we got permission to build a building .
we call it the numbers .
the entire building is built from water .
there &apos;s no doors or window , but when you walk into it , it automatically opens up the road .
the roofs also covered with water .
if there &apos;s a little bit of wind , if you want to have fewer water , you can actually reduce the roofs down .
or even close the building , the building disappears , and it looks like this .
and these days , you &apos;ll see them in the winter days , and when they got down to the roof , they say , &quot; They &apos;re <unk> the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t , but when it dropped , the building was almost completely gone .
this is what water does .
you can see how people get into trouble .
this is the sensor that I &apos;m trying to keep my feet off , turning on the reflection on the door .
I should tell you what happens at night when all the sensors stopped working .
but it became even more interesting that night .
all the kids in the courtyard are getting all the different , because the way you get into the building is different .
the building will no longer open and let you enter , but the building will still be divided into different space , so you can &apos;t have to go to the point where the building is .
and it &apos;s also interesting to us , because , as an architect , as an engineer , as a designer , we often think about how people use what we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always unexpected .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing this .
this is a physical pixel , made out of water , and then made a projection on it .
and it reminds me of the next project I want to show you .
this is , imagine the pixels to fly .
imagine that you would have a small helicopter that would move in the air , and each of them has a little pixels to change color in the pixels -- almost like a cloud that can move in the air .
watch a video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one we just saw , and a few other helicopters , synchronize , moving .
so you get this cloud .
you get a screen that bends and presented with a flexible screen , like this one -- two @-@ dimensional configuration .
or the usual , but the three @-@ dimensional changes are the pixels , not the pixels .
you can use different ways .
imagine the display of your display could be made from a different size or a different scale .
but everything is just a three @-@ dimensional cloud , and you can zoom in and cross it and see it from many , many perspectives .
this is a vertical @-@ takeoff grid like the one I just described .
when you turn on the lights , you &apos;re actually seeing this . it &apos;s the same as we looked at before .
imagine if every one of these is controlled by a human being .
you can put every pixel in there by person , from person to person , from person moving , and so on .
I showed you some of the first ones .
we &apos;re working with <unk> <unk> , one of the leading <unk> of the <unk> -- the New York Museum of Art Museum and <unk> -- to capture his 3D movements in real time .
you can see the dancing .
you can play it on the left , on the left .
this is all in real time 3D scanning and motion capture .
so you can <unk> this whole movement .
you can jump like this .
but once you have those pixels , you can steer them with color and gravity .
and we wanted to use this as a sort of <unk> input .
I want to show you the last project we &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s something we did for the Olympic Olympics .
it &apos;s called the digital cloud .
and the idea came from , again , to imagine , we can get people involved in changing the environment -- to actually fund our digital cloud of cloud building -- like Lego blocks , but the digital cloud .
think about the money that you can give everyone a pixel .
and I think what has happened in the last few years is that the remarkable thing is that in the last few decades , we &apos;ve gone through the physical world to the digital world .
now electronics , knowledge , the <unk> of the Internet are everywhere .
today , for the first time -- Obama said to us -- we can go from the digital world , self @-@ organized networks to the physical world .
it &apos;s possible , in this case , to design and create a logo .
it would mean some building in the city .
but the future is going to be the near challenges that we have today -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do we go from the digital world to the physical world .
so we can actually get people involved in this .
these numbers are cloud clouds , and they &apos;re formed using pixel pixels , in fact , in the cloud form of particles to form clouds .
these particles are water , and the cloud of pixel elements form .
this is London .
you can walk in and experience different experiences .
you can actually see at the bottom , the critical moment of the Olympics in 2012 , and really use it as a bridge for socially .
and the clouds in the sky are at the top of what you can get , like the new top of London .
you can get in .
it &apos;s a completely new digital <unk> at night -- but most importantly , create a kind of experience where anyone can get to the hump .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is important to me .
and through my artwork , I try to address the fact that humans are not separate from nature , everything is interconnected .
about 10 years ago , I went to Antarctica , and I first saw an iceberg .
I felt awe .
my heart was quick , steady , trying to figure out what this is in front of me .
the iceberg was almost 200 feet away from me , and I was just surprised that this was a patch of snow covered in another piece of ice , year after year .
the iceberg formed when they broke off the ice sheets or broke off the Ross Ice Shelf .
each iceberg has its own unique personalities .
instead of interacting with the environment around them , they have a distinct way .
some of the iceberg refused to compromise , and some of the iceberg was just too rusty to protect the ice .
when you look at the iceberg , it &apos;s easy to think of them as separate , they &apos;re separate , they &apos;re separate , they &apos;re separate , they &apos;re more like us , sometimes .
but the reality is much more than that .
as the iceberg melts , I breath out of its ancient odor .
and as it melts , it releasing the minerals , and it feeds everything .
I started photographing these creatures , and I was taking photographs of my ancestors , and learning that there would be no more such a way than that .
and when it melts , it &apos;s not a death story ; it &apos;s an end , it &apos;s a path to a never @-@ ending .
I photographed the iceberg , some of which were very young -- thousands of years .
some ice is over 100,000 years .
the last image I want to show you is a iceberg shot from Greenland .
it &apos;s a very rare opportunity where you can actually see a iceberg unfold .
so here we are .
on the left you see a boat .
this is a boat about 15 feet .
I want you to look at the shape of the iceberg , the shape of the iceberg , on the surface .
and here you see it starting with a little boat , a boat moving up to the other side , a man stands there .
this is an average width of Greenland .
it came to the water , it was about 120 feet or 40 meters tall .
this is actual shot .
like this iceberg , they show you a different aspect of their personality .
thank you .
I had the privilege of getting involved in this amazing project in my life .
but the really cool stuff about this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the first graffiti artists of the 1980s .
he came home one day and he said , &quot; Dad , my legs were kind of <unk> . &quot;
this was the early symptom of the patient .
and this is completely paralyzed .
it &apos;s only his eyes .
I was with him .
I had a company that was designing and animation that clearly the graffiti was a complex part of the art world that we admire and respected in the art world .
so we decided to become Tony , the sponsor of the project .
so I went to find his brother and his dad and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you some money .
what would you do ? &quot;
his brother said , &quot; I just want to talk to Tony .
I just wanted to communicate with him and he can communicate with me . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Wait a minute , I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking , &quot; not all the paralyzed people can communicate with each other through these devices ?
and he said , &quot; No , unless it &apos;s a silent man , unless it &apos;s a terrible person , &quot; there &apos;s no way to do it .
it &apos;s not that easy . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK , how do you communicate ? &quot;
have you ever seen the movie &quot; <unk> and butterflies ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- moves their fingers .
and I said , &quot; It &apos;s too messy . how is that possible ? &quot;
the wish I came up was to just open the check , and instead , I started a check that I had no idea how to break .
and I promised his brother and his father -- &quot; OK , let &apos;s talk , let &apos;s give him a machine , we &apos;ll find a way to make him do it again .
because you can &apos;t communicate normally , it &apos;s ridiculous . &quot;
a few months later , I had a speech at a conference .
I met these guys called <unk> , the graffiti lab , and they have a technology that allows them to take a beam of light into any surface , and then paint it with a laser beam of light , a kind of dark gap .
they walk around and show art like this .
all of these things , they call it a life cycle .
first you start with <unk> , then you &apos;re the god of <unk> Bush , and you see art .
but they always showed that there was a life @-@ cycle .
and I went home , and I was having dinner with my wife for dinner with my wife , and I was telling her , &quot; Wait a minute , if we knew that this technology would allow you to control things with your eyes , why don &apos;t we take a laser to control a beam of light , and that would be great . &quot;
so we started doing it .
about two years later , about a year , a year later , through many organizations and many of us changed something .
first of all , we gave the doors to the insurance company , and we really gave him a machine to communicate -- a Stephen Hawking &apos;s machine .
that &apos;s great .
he &apos;s the most fun person -- I call him a <unk> , because you talk to him , he gives you a sense of , &quot; I &apos;m not . this guy &apos;s fine . &quot;
the other thing we did was , we gathered together programmers from all over the world -- literally , every corner of the world -- bringing them to us .
my wife and I moved to the garage behind , the hackers , the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
many of our friends thought that we were so stupid that when we put our house back on the wall , the images were taken , and the walls were covered .
but after two weeks of doing this , we went to Venice , and my child was involved , and my dog was involved , and we built this .
we call it the eye @-@ view mirror , and you can see that .
this is the cheap sunglasses , and we buy it on a <unk> path to Venice , some <unk> and some lessons from <unk> and Radio Shack .
we took an LED @-@ ray camera , dismantle it , put it in an LED pad , and now this device is free -- to make it yourself , we open the source , you can download it for free .
now we can do it completely without limits .
no insurance company can say , &quot; No . &quot;
no hospital can say , &quot; No . &quot;
anyone who &apos;s paralyzed can now use their eyes to paint and communicate .
thank you .
thank you very much . that &apos;s great .
at the end of two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
I love this picture because this is somebody &apos;s room , and this is his room .
all of these congestion are all for a significant moment .
over a year &apos;s program , two weeks of programming , fast food cycle , Tony &apos;s first started drawing in seven years .
this is an amazing image , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking at his life support system .
we <unk> his bed so he can see .
we formed a projector , and we made a hole out of the park .
and he started painting again , in front of his family and friends -- you can imagine what it felt like in a parking lot .
interestingly , we also wanted to break the parking lot , so we felt like we were part of the whole graffiti project .
and at the end of this session , he sent us an <unk> letter , and it said , &quot; It &apos;s the first time I &apos;d ever painted seven years .
I felt like I &apos;d been running underwater , and somebody finally reached out to the water and got me to breathe . &quot;
that &apos;s great , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s kind of like our fight .
that &apos;s what makes us go forward .
we walked so far .
it &apos;s a great device , but it &apos;s different from the drawings .
one has more artistic potential .
we &apos;re still exploring how to make it better , faster , more powerful .
and since then , we have all kinds of acceptance .
we won a lot of rewards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us make money out of it .
all the costs are us .
and we said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s great . &quot;
Armstrong had written about our Twitter , and then in December , the magazine gave us one of the top 50 inventions , which is really cool .
and the really cool thing is -- this is going to complete the whole thing -- April this year , the Museum of <unk> in Los Angeles , there will be a new art museum called &quot; street art . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of street art going to be in the streets -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all of these people are going to be there .
and it &apos;s great to be in the middle of the night .
so basically my point is , if you see something that &apos;s not impossible , make it possible .
all the things that happened in this room were impossible -- this stage , this computer , this <unk> , this <unk> -- were impossible .
everybody in this room made it possible .
I &apos;m not a programmer , and I &apos;ve never done anything to do with the eyes of any eye , but I just think about something and linking myself to some amazing people that we can do something about .
I just wanted everybody to do it every day , and when you think about something you should do , you should ask your questions . if I don &apos;t do it , when do I do it , who would do it ?
thank you .
as you know , my job is to write children &apos;s books , and actually I &apos;m probably the most widely read in America .
I often tell people that I don &apos;t want to be a scientist .
you can think of me as a farmer , as a farmer , as a farmer , as a farmer .
I &apos;m here to tell you today about recycling and <unk> .
and it &apos;s often that you find yourself in some situations .
you need to go around and find an epiphany .
this is a picture of a cycle .
a friend of mine drew this -- Richard Saul Wurman .
it &apos;s complicated . I &apos;m going to tell you about that .
the cycle of my cycle started in the 1960s with a <unk> high school .
and I was the one who was suspended in the filter every week until a teacher pulled me out of this life .
she pulled me out of this life and put me in the bathroom .
and she did .
she did it for three years .
but I had to leave the town .
with expertise , and also about 85 dollars , finally , I found myself in <unk> , California - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
about three or four years ago , I got a call from that teacher at night , and she said , &quot; I need to see you .
I was disappointed that we never knew each other as adults .
can you please come and find someone you &apos;ve been looking for ?
I should mention that I have <unk> cancer , but I want you to ignore that part .
so the next day we went to Cleveland .
we met her , we talked , we watched , and we knew she was going to have to live in an old patient .
we found a family for her , taking her back to her , taking care of her family , because it was necessary .
some things we need to know how to do .
and it was this way of thinking about my girls as adults , that eventually put them in the trash box in my hands .
and what happened was that , at the end of the cycle , it formed a circle -- the epiphany of what I said was self @-@ awareness .
and that epiphany was part of life .
she saved my life . I saved her life .
and that was the day of life .
it needs real and perfect , and I &apos;m happy that these days have been mentioned .
and it also needs -- it needs to have dignity and pleasure , and our job is to take these walking around .
thank you .
the idea behind the computer worms is actually quite simple .
we don &apos;t want Iran to have nuclear weapons .
they &apos;re used to developing nuclear weapons @-@ grade facilities for highly enriched uranium .
the <unk> boxes you see are real @-@ time control .
if we manage to hack into these systems of speed and valves , we can actually use a lot of problems .
this <unk> box doesn &apos;t run Windows ; they &apos;re using a completely different technology .
but if we manage to take a Windows virus and put it in an engineer to run this <unk> box , then we can start acting .
that &apos;s a conspiracy behind the virus .
so I started with a Windows <unk> .
it carried the virus up to the <unk> box , and a centrifuge , and a backpack <unk> -- and it was done .
it &apos;s easy , right ?
I want to tell you how we found this .
when we started working on the virus about six months ago , we had no idea what it was .
the only thing you know is that its Windows portion , which is very complex , has multiple <unk> attacks .
it kind of wants to do something with these remote boxes , these real @-@ time control systems .
and this caught our attention , and we started a lab project , and we had a virus that we had , and we looked at it very carefully .
and then something very interesting happened .
and the way the viruses behave is like the ones that don &apos;t like the <unk> -- smell , but don &apos;t want to eat .
I don &apos;t understand .
and after we experimented with various <unk> , I realized that this was an intentional attack .
it &apos;s totally directed .
if you find a specific configuration , you &apos;re going to be willing to dive in a van , even though it &apos;s trying to get infected and do the same thing .
if there wasn &apos;t a target , it didn &apos;t do anything .
and this really caught my attention , and we started working on this , because I don &apos;t think we know it yet .
the goal is , for example , a nuclear power plant , or a German chemical factory .
so we &apos;d better figure out what to do with it .
we took and <unk> the code , and we realized that it had two digital bombs -- a smaller , bigger one .
and what we also found was that they were highly skilled at creating information .
they know all the details about what to attack their goal .
they even knew the number of shoes .
they know everything .
if you &apos;ve ever heard of this , the complexity of the virus , the high @-@ tech , let me tell you , it &apos;s a very complicated virus .
it &apos;s more than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and here you see the footage of the actual attack .
we &apos;re talking about -- it &apos;s about 50,000 pieces of code .
it looks very old .
I want to tell you about how we can figure this out .
the first thing we have to look for is the system <unk> , because we know what these functions are .
and then we had to find <unk> and <unk> and try to connect them to the real world -- to connect with the potential world .
so we need to figure out if we can figure out whether or not .
in order to get the idea , we remember that this was a ultimate damaging destruction , so there was a high value proposition , and there could be many , many , many of which were infected in Iran because of the report of Iran .
there &apos;s not a lot of targets in this region .
it basically reduces its objective down to <unk> and <unk> plant plants .
so I said to my assistant , &quot; Get a list of all the rich and plant experts in a centrifuge . &quot;
I talked to them , got them through their expertise , and figured out what we found in code and data .
it works pretty well .
we can connect this little number with the controllers .
this wall is the movements inside of a centrifuge , and this is the black object you see .
if you control the speed of the pen , you can actually crack the pen and make it explode .
and we also saw the goal of the attack , which was to slow down all of this -- obviously , to keep the engineers insane , they &apos;re not going to be able to figure out the problem very quickly .
the big numbers are -- by taking a closer look at the data and looking at the data , we have a chance to understand it .
for example , the numbers are pretty compelling in these code ; they can &apos;t ignore it .
and I started studying how the scientific literature about how they were organized in a scientific literature about how they were organized in a thing called a level , and each of them contains a centrifuge .
it &apos;s a little bit better to match .
even better match .
and in Iran , these centrifuge were divided into 15 of these series .
guess what we found in the code ?
a virtually identical theme structure .
so once again , it &apos;s perfectly match .
this gave us more confidence in what we do .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , it &apos;s not like this .
these results involve a couple of weeks of hard work .
we often walk in and start looking at the starting point .
so in short , we &apos;ve identified these two goals at the same goals .
and the little <unk> picked a scaling , and the speed goes up , and then they slow down , and then the big one loses the valves at six levels .
in general , we were pretty confident that we knew what the goal was .
it &apos;s the <unk> . it &apos;s the <unk> .
we don &apos;t worry about what other viruses might be attacking .
some of the really cool stuff that we &apos;ve seen -- I mean , it really blew my mind .
and here &apos;s the <unk> box , and there &apos;s a centrifuge up there .
and the thing is , it <unk> the input from the sensor -- for example , the input from pressure sensors and shock sensors -- and it provides a clear code that will continue on during attack , on the code , on the actual input of the code .
in fact , the number of input @-@ output data that was written about <unk> virus .
and just like the <unk> footage of a Hollywood film , the camera was even recorded in advance .
cool , isn &apos;t it ?
and it was certainly not just the driver of the control room .
it &apos;s actually more dangerous , more predator @-@ like .
it &apos;s going to be around the digital security system .
we need digital security systems where the operator can &apos;t do enough .
for example , in the power plant , when the big speed of light comes down , it has to open up a millisecond .
obviously , the human operator can &apos;t .
so here we need the digital security system .
and when they get hit , the real problems come out .
the power plant will explode .
the operator and the safety system doesn &apos;t notice .
it &apos;s terrifying .
but it gets worse .
what I &apos;m going to talk about is very important .
think about this . this attack is universal .
it doesn &apos;t require specific things to do with a centrifuge .
it also works , for example , in a power plant or a car .
it &apos;s common .
as an attacker , the jury doesn &apos;t need -- don &apos;t have to send the data out , like we saw in the case of the <unk> virus .
you can also be transmitted by conventional worms .
as many as possible to spread it .
and if you do that , you end up having a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s what we have to deal with .
unfortunately , the biggest goal of these attacks is not in the Middle East .
it &apos;s in the U.S. , Europe and Japan .
all of these green areas , these are target density .
we had to deal with those consequences , and we &apos;d better start doing it immediately .
thank you .
I have a question .
Ralph <unk> , who believed that the black hole was the <unk> .
what do you see ?
Ralph <unk> : okay , you really want to know ?
yeah , OK .
I don &apos;t think that <unk> has one , but that &apos;s not Israel .
and then the afterward afterward afterward afterward , the Internet superpower .
only one , that &apos;s America -- very lucky , very lucky .
because otherwise , the problems we faced were even more profound .
thank you so much for letting us smile , thank you , Ralph .
in the last few years , I &apos;ve put myself in tough and dangerous situations .
I went to prison -- tough .
I worked in a coal @-@ fired industry -- dangerous .
I was photographing film in the war -- neither hard and dangerous .
I was eating this food in the last 30 days -- which was very interesting to be in the middle , and at the end , it was very dangerous .
in fact , for most of my career , I &apos;ve been keeping myself in the worst position of my career in getting people to work on social problems , in the form of mental illness , in the form of <unk> .
so , when I knew I was going to come here and talk to TED about brands and funding , I realized I wanted to do the same thing .
some of you may have heard about this a couple of weeks ago , and I ran an ad in <unk> .
and then Twitter and Twitter came a little bit of information , and I asked people to buy my TED Talk in 2011 .
and yes , some lucky person or company would have the opportunity to come to life , because I &apos;m sure Chris Anderson would never allow this to happen , the second time -- to buy a TEDTalk that you &apos;re looking at , there was no point at all .
so what you &apos;ve got is this : you &apos;re the person who &apos;s in this room : you don &apos;t know anything about my TED Talk , and it determines whether I &apos;m going to ruin it , if I give you shame the company , the odds are big .
but then again , there &apos;s a wonderful opportunity for this ad .
do you know how many people are watching TED ?
that &apos;s a lot .
by the way , this is just the cover of the talk .
and I believe some people will buy it .
if you were to ask me a year ago , I wouldn &apos;t be as picky as you would have .
but in the new project that I &apos;m working on , which is my new film , we have to deal with the world of marketing .
as I said earlier , in the years I &apos;ve always put myself in a situation where I &apos;ve been in a situation where I &apos;ve been in a situation where I &apos;ve been most vulnerable to my most vulnerable experience than any of these people have ever been .
you see , I have a film like this .
Morgan <unk> : I wanted to make a film about advertising , marketing , marketing and movie , and the funding for this is from the ads , marketing and marketing .
the title of the film is &quot; The <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; top and bottom , &quot; all across history , all over the place is a brand @-@ owned , and the bottom @-@ up is a brand .
this brand , <unk> <unk> center .
the lives of these people combine the film with this film -- forever .
and this was a view of the film -- Michael <unk> : what is it ?
I always say it again .
that &apos;s to emphasize .
it &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but not only do we sell each other &apos;s brand , but we also sell every product in the video of the brand .
so we sell one pair of shoes , and we become the most <unk> of all time .
the best car ever @-@ operated film ever opened in history , the one that made the most difficult @-@ to @-@ ever @-@ present @-@ time film .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : so what that means is not just that the brand is part of people &apos;s lives , but it &apos;s raising this brand .
&#91; unclear &#93; So in fact , we &apos;re going to show the process of marketing .
the film is about transparency .
in this video , you &apos;re going to see the <unk> of the brand .
that &apos;s the concept of the entire movie , throughout the movie .
hopefully help .
Robert Friedman : it was interesting to me when I first heard this , I think it was the most painful homage to the audience .
but I don &apos;t know if people can .
Edith Widder : have you ever thought about this -- I don &apos;t want to take the word &quot; picture , &quot; because it &apos;s got a negative color -- what do you think the result of that film is ?
DR : how much would this film take ?
one and a half million people .
John Kamen : I think it &apos;s going to be very difficult to deal with these brand , but it &apos;s a great way to find these huge brands .
<unk> <unk> : who knows , when your movie comes out , we may be a bunch of <unk> .
Beau Lotto : what do you think they will do ?
Sebastian <unk> : most of them refuse to refuse .
Barnett : and the reason they refused was because I himself ?
John Kamen : anyone .
LM : okay .
sir , can you help me ? I need help .
Michael <unk> : I can help you .
FG : great .
that &apos;s great .
Michael Sandel : we must lock the brand .
FG : exactly .
the people you &apos;re going to deal with ...
Michael Sandel : we have some people on the chain .
let &apos;s turn the camera off .
&#91; unclear &#93; So I thought , &quot; <unk> off the camera &quot; &#93; meant talking about it in private .
as a result , it meant , &quot; We don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your film . &quot;
Mac Barnett : so this is where these companies came and disappeared .
no one was willing to help this film .
and I was shocked .
they didn &apos;t have any interest in this project .
and I was shocked to think that the idea of an ad , the idea of an advertising ad , was essentially to put your product in front of as many people as possible .
in particular in the world today &apos;s media , shouldn &apos;t there be a new way of transporting information to the masses ?
no , it &apos;s just my personal idea .
the problem is , you see my idea , there &apos;s a terrible mistake that &apos;s wrong here .
in fact , no , that &apos;s wrong .
that &apos;s not the problem .
this is something you can do .
but this graph represents the problem .
you see , if you Google &quot; <unk> &quot; -- this is one of the biggest slides on the search .
I like your mode , <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the problem : transparency -- transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , ability to see things that are easy to perceive , that are relevant to business -- the last one is probably the biggest problem .
you see , recently , we hear transparency .
our politicians , our president and even our CEO are using this word .
and yet , when it comes to practice , it changes .
why ? transparency is <unk> -- it &apos;s like this bear here , but it &apos;s also a dead bear .
it &apos;s a strange one @-@ to @-@ one -- as this strange , strange street in the country .
it looked like a <unk> .
so what else ?
you eat all that ice cream , and you eat that ice cream .
it &apos;s pretty bleak .
when I started talking to companies , we wanted to tell a story like this , and they said , &quot; Oh , we want to tell you a story .
we want you to tell stories , we just want you to tell our stories . &quot;
when I was a child , my father sometimes realized that I was looking at it -- he was looking at me all the time -- he said , &quot; Son , every story has three stories .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , there &apos;s a real story . &quot;
you see , we want to tell the story with this film .
and only one of the companies were willing to help me -- because I was in a team with John Bond -- and I realized , well , that &apos;s better than the fact that I had to skip the <unk> with my team , right ?
and you suddenly start to realize that -- or when I started to realize -- you start talking to these companies about your own brand , it &apos;s a common problem .
FG : I &apos;ve got two friends from Hollywood ; I &apos;ve met people like me who make small independent movies .
and my friends of the Hollywood movies told me they were successful because of their brand .
and my friends who made small films , independent films , said , &quot; How can we do it ? &quot;
and one of those movies is called &quot; The <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
so how do we see this brand in this film ?
and when I got out of my desk , every time I open my kitchen cabinet , you see the dishes rolling around .
whenever I talk to someone , I say , &quot; You &apos;re going to clean up today ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
let me give you a break .
maybe you can use some of it before you talk . &quot;
and we just <unk> these <unk> body fluids .
whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , there &apos;s always one right for you .
we &apos;re going to give the men to come up with these products -- solid , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> body fluids .
that &apos;s what happens .
now I &apos;m going to answer any of you , and let you know what ?
Frank Gehry : we &apos;re a pretty good designer .
like the little movies that you &apos;re talking about , we &apos;re the start @-@ up brand .
we don &apos;t look like other brands .
and to do that kind of campaign -- you know , it &apos;s about reaching people &apos;s attention -- and this is where we get to .
FG : what kind of word do you use to describe this brand ?
how about the traffic ?
Ze Frank : okay .
technology .
<unk> <unk> : technology is not the best way to describe body fluids , which are products that people use in their arms .
we talked about daring , <unk> .
I want to say , &quot; <unk> &quot; is the positive flow of products , the flow of light , the need for comfort . &quot;
it gives you a sense of <unk> .
how do you <unk> your body -- it &apos;s much more clean .
these things can be positive .
that &apos;s a billion @-@ dollar corporate group .
so what did a man think ?
I had to ask people on the street , and they were like me , and it was people who couldn &apos;t walk .
they have to tell their brand .
<unk> : how do you describe your brand ?
my brand ?
I don &apos;t know .
I love very good dress .
in the 1980s , it &apos;s a cross between punk <unk> .
FG : okay . so what is the brand ?
FG : special .
I think it &apos;s my style that I think is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I love the dark things .
I usually wear a <unk> , like <unk> , and I like a <unk> .
if you had a brand new brand , it would be a classic open buggy .
two : my brand , I would like to call it &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
two : a bit of a hippie , a bit of suspended animation , a little bit of a girls &apos; flavor -- I don &apos;t know .
I love raising my pet .
the national bank , the national bank .
I think that &apos;s my brand .
in the midst of this <unk> , this is my brand .
my brand is FedEx .
&#91; &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &#93; . &quot;
is this a real problem ?
lawyer : my brand is lawyers .
Tom : I &apos;m Tom .
Beau Lotto : so we can &apos;t all be Tom , but I find myself the result of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I realized that what I needed was an expert .
a person who could read my mind could really help me understand what a brand is .
so I found a company in Pittsburgh called <unk> .
they have helped to see their brand , their brand <unk> , their brand .
if they were able to help those brands , then they would certainly help me .
LM : you &apos;ve got the pictures right ?
FG : I took it . the first picture was my show .
<unk> <unk> : please tell me that this photo has something to do with you .
FG : these people helped me to see the world .
<unk> <unk> : what kind of a world .
<unk> : the world ? I think your world is your world -- everybody around you , your friends , your family , your lifestyle , your work .
there &apos;s a place where all this stuff can get together , and that &apos;s where I &apos;m in West Virginia .
<unk> : what &apos;s next ?
&#91; unclear &#93; following : this is my happiest day .
<unk> <unk> : what does this relate to your perception ?
FG : it &apos;s somebody I want to be .
I love novelty .
I love weird things .
<unk> <unk> : tell me , &quot; Why &quot; -- what does this help us ?
so what does that mean ? where do you come from ?
why is that important ? what is the red line ?
so let me explain this part .
what doesn &apos;t match your style ?
what have you experienced ?
it &apos;s not necessarily fear . what kind of a roller coaster that you &apos;re sitting on ?
FG : Whoa !
Lakshmi <unk> : thank you for your patience .
Lakshmi <unk> : yeah .
well , I don &apos;t know what the end result is .
that &apos;s a lot of complex stuff .
Edith Widder : so the first letter of this is two separate layers of your brand , two different than the others -- 0.1 @-@ based brand is a brand , two or three times more ideas .
these are the two great <unk> that come together .
and it &apos;s almost like a <unk> .
I think some companies are more likely to weigh one of them , and not both .
most companies tend to -- and this is the <unk> -- avoid the fact that they can &apos;t take away from fear , etc . , and you &apos;re actually placing it into the <unk> , which is great .
so what does a brand like that look like ?
the first one is the classic , Apple .
there &apos;s also Target , the <unk> from the <unk> , and there &apos;s <unk> .
some brands are &quot; naked , &quot; some brands are deep inside , and they &apos;re not long enough , but a depth of ideas , a depth of ideas , a very powerful brand .
<unk> <unk> : a brand . what about your brand ?
what if somebody asked you to describe your brand , your brand , what would you describe ?
are you annoyed ? are you going to make people happy ?
or is it a static brand ?
do you make a stronger brand , <unk> ?
the brand is more <unk> , like the novelty <unk> , adventure @-@ to @-@ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , novelty , mystery .
or are you more unstable ?
do you think of it as a James Bond ?
do you <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> like Oprah ?
do you deserve to be trusted , stable , familiar , committed to ideas and wisdom , like the Dalai Lama or the <unk> ?
and from this film , we found that companies beyond <unk> or <unk> , they said , &quot; No , they don &apos;t want to have anything to do with it .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with the film , because they didn &apos;t control them .
but we finally got 17 companies working with people like me who were willing to work with people like me , who had their power to tell stories , their power to tell stories , to tell stories that we didn &apos;t know -- to the stories that we didn &apos;t know .
they told us stories about <unk> , and we talked about how they were going to use MRI to find an area of the brain that controls the need , and then we &apos;re going to start shooting fish .
we went to Rio de Janeiro .
this city , in the last five years , had no sign of any billboard , no posters , no <unk> , nothing .
we went to the school district , where companies tried to put ads in all the major schools in the United States .
what blew my mind was , let me get the most feedback or the things I got the biggest benefit of all .
that &apos;s what the brand does .
they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , thought , well , these <unk> may not take my benefits .
I &apos;m going to focus on artists .
I &apos;m going to create a very special film with him , and it &apos;s going to change the way we think about the world .
what does it do to people ? is it successful ?
this is a film that came out in the Galapagos , and let &apos;s see .
and according to the data , film has been published in January since then -- it &apos;s not the whole movie -- we &apos;ve got about nine billion stories of the press .
the whole story was covered in two weeks .
and this is just what happens on the Web -- not including <unk> , television .
it wasn &apos;t even released .
there &apos;s no online TV .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
and the film ended up getting a lot of attention .
this was a nice show for a movie like this , and we were asked by an ad agency , not to participate .
I still believe that if you dare , if you dare , take risks , those risks become opportunities .
I believe that when you don &apos;t let people take risks , you &apos;re pushing them towards failure .
I believe that when you educate your employees , you don &apos;t take risks , you &apos;re putting the benefits of the whole company into danger .
I think we have to encourage people to take risks .
we must encourage people not to be afraid of seemingly dangerous opportunities .
and finally , moving forward , I think we have to face our fears .
I had to put that bear in the cage .
the fear is faced with risks .
after a bite , you face the risk .
finally , we have to embrace transparency .
now , more than ever before , a little bit of faith can come alive .
and I said , &quot; <unk> transparency with honesty , through faith and transparency , &quot; <unk> transparency , &quot; by my good friends at <unk> , they did it at <unk> , and they bought it at <unk> .
<unk> : big data , big opportunities for global entrepreneurs .
<unk> give you transparency .
thank you very much .
so , where does that leave us alone with zero dollars ?
FG : that &apos;s a great question .
I have a check in my pocket that &apos;s a <unk> from the TED <unk> Foundation , and that &apos;s a $ <unk> check for my next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I proposed this idea to do something in art and museum , and my boss was here today .
it took 18 months .
and there &apos;s a lot of really interesting talks and stories , and I can talk to you about nine countries , and I &apos;ve got 17 really interesting museum experiences .
but I want to focus on this .
I can tell stories about why we do this .
my personal story is very simple : how do I get into the slides ?
I grew up in India .
I got a great education , and I didn &apos;t want to complain about what I was , but I didn &apos;t have a lot of opportunities to visit these museums and artwork .
so when I had the opportunity to travel around these museum , I learned a lot .
and when I was working on Google , I was able to participate in this idea of making it easier for you to come to see it .
so we built a team , a wonderful team , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to go into the demo and tell you a few interesting stories about how it started .
so , very simple . you go to <unk>
you see all the museum .
you see the museum , you see the New York Museum of Modern Art , the museum , the museum of the Netherlands , the museum of the museum .
now let me get to one of my favorites .
there are two ways to go , very simple .
click , bang , you go into the museum .
wherever you are , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t matter .
you turn around and you enjoy it .
you want to follow a line in the museum .
you click on it . you punch it up .
you go in there . you want to go to the edge of the hallway .
go on and play .
explore .
thank you . I haven &apos;t talked about the best part .
now I &apos;m faced with a painting of Peter <unk> .
and I saw this + number .
if the museum gave us imagery , you click on it .
this is one of the images .
here &apos;s all the metadata data .
if you &apos;re really interested in this artwork , you can click on this , but now I &apos;m going to lock it up .
this is an image we took , and this is what we call the <unk> <unk> technique .
for example , this is an image , close to 100 billion pixels .
a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you get from 100 billion pixels ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to show you what the 100 million pixels are .
you can just contract it .
you see something interesting .
I love this guy . he &apos;s got a flexible look .
but you really want to go further .
so I looked around and I saw what was happening here .
and I said , &quot; Wait a sec .
close to home , I started noticing what these kids are throwing .
and I looked at it and I talked to a couple of people in the museum , and it was a game called <unk> , and it was a tough stand @-@ up to my aunt on the side of a stick .
and it was pretty popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something .
and now it gets deeper , and you can see the <unk> .
now let me show you a little bit of the vision , and I &apos;m going to zoom out , and you can see it all .
this is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is not yet , wait .
now let &apos;s go to the Museum of Modern Art .
my other favorite : &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I &apos;m going to give you an example of the details .
so what if you wanted to look at that ?
and if you want to see how this works .
you zoom in . you really zoom in .
I got to my favorite part , and I could really see the <unk> .
this is &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I thought , I never saw it .
I &apos;m going to show you another one of my favorite features .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff . I don &apos;t have time to go through it .
this is one of the really cool parts .
any of you , no matter whether you &apos;re rich or poor , whether you have a gorgeous house or not .
you can go in and create your own online museum in these pieces .
it &apos;s simple . you come in and I create this force called the <unk> force , and you can see it everywhere .
this is the <unk> of National Gallery .
you can write <unk> and send your friends to them and really talk about the sense of your work .
so I want to conclude by saying that for me , the most important thing is that these creatures are not from Google .
I personally thought it wasn &apos;t even a museum .
I &apos;m not supposed to say that .
it really came from these artists .
and that &apos;s the way I feel it .
I mean , I want the digital media to be able to show their artwork correctly .
and the biggest problem I &apos;ve got today is , &quot; Do you want to replicate it ? &quot;
my answer was no .
this is a replacement experience .
and I said , thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of the brain . your brain is divided into two pieces .
the left hemisphere , mostly in reason , and the right brain , is responsible .
if we measure the capacity of the brain &apos;s hemispheres , we measure our brains and we measure our brains .
for example , it means somebody &apos;s completely rational .
that means somebody &apos;s complete emotional .
so where do you put your brain online ?
some people might choose one of those extremes , but I think most people in the audience , your brain should be more or less like this -- two brains have a very high potential .
they &apos;re less likely to reject or anything else .
you can be rational and emotional .
I think that since I &apos;m a quantum physicist , like most other quantum physicists , there &apos;s a lot of logic that can link those complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we also need a good intuition to keep the experiments going .
so how do we raise that intuition ? well , we like to study things .
we study and <unk> , and then we see how it responds , and then we improve our instinct .
you actually do the same thing .
some of the intuitions that you may have developed for a number of years is just one thing that happens at the same time .
I mean , it &apos;s going to be strange to think about a thing that can happen at the same time in two different places , but you &apos;re not born with this idea , you &apos;re born .
I remember seeing a child playing in a van .
and he was just a walking and not very good at this child , and he fell down .
but I bet a very valuable lesson about play with <unk> , which is that large objects don &apos;t allow you to go through and stay in a place .
this is a very conceptual model in the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
it &apos;s also a very bad model for particle physicists , because they don &apos;t study the <unk> , they study the little particles .
when they looked at their particles , they felt that they were doing all kinds of really strange things -- like they could penetrate the wall , or they could come in two places .
they were recording these findings , and they were using a theory called quantum mechanics .
this is the edge of physics a few years ago ; you need quantum mechanics to describe tiny , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need it to describe those gigantic , everyday objects .
it doesn &apos;t really match my intuition , maybe because I don &apos;t study the particles too often .
well , I do sometimes research on them , but it &apos;s just the same .
and I never saw them .
I mean , nobody could see the particles .
but that doesn &apos;t match my logic .
because if everything is made up of particles , and each of those particles is followed by quantum theory , then shouldn &apos;t anything follow quantum theory ?
I couldn &apos;t find why it didn &apos;t follow .
so I know better about the whole thing , and if we look at it in a way that tells us everything is rooted in quantum mechanics .
not long ago , I started .
I built this .
this is the first product you can see and the result of quantum mechanics .
what we see here is a computer chip .
in the middle , you can probably see the <unk> .
that &apos;s the metals that I &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of it .
focus a little . we see that at the center .
this is a very close @-@ up , very close @-@ up view .
what we see is a little bit of metal , it looks like a waterfall board , and it stretch out at one end .
I made these metals out of almost the same way I made computer chips .
I &apos;m manipulating a piece of silicon chip , and I &apos;m <unk> around all these large machines for about 100 hours .
in the end , I had to create my own machine -- at the bottom of the swimming pool .
this device has the ability to layer a quantum layer , but it needs some help to do it .
let me give you an example .
do you know how uncomfortable it is in a crowded elevator ?
I mean , when I was a person in the elevator , I could do all kinds of weird things , but when other people came in , I stopped doing these things because I didn &apos;t want to talk to other people , or , frankly , to other people .
so quantum mechanics tells us that non @-@ living organisms change the same way .
not only are the people living in a non @-@ living creature , but it also contains its light and its intensity .
so if we want to see the properties of quantum mechanics , we have to wipe out all the other passenger pigeon .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
we turn off the lights , and then we put it in a bench , and we pull out all the air , and then we cool it down to above freezing .
now , in the elevator , the little <unk> can do anything she wants to do .
we measured the motion .
we found it in a very strange way .
it &apos;s vibrating , not completely static , and it &apos;s vibrating like this -- like a <unk> jacket .
and just to give it a little bit of impact , we can make it vibrate and we don &apos;t vibrate at the same time -- something that only happens in quantum mechanics .
I &apos;m here to tell you a couple of wonderful things .
what does a thing vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
one example : all the atoms made up of a billion are moving at the same time , and the atoms are moving up and down .
they &apos;re only at a certain time .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re <unk> professions .
that means every atom is in two different places at the same time , and further suggests that the whole field is in two positions .
and I think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
I &apos;ve been pretty good for all of these years because , look at this , the scale of a single atom and a <unk> is about the same as the <unk> of your individual individual individual .
so if the single individual position is at the same time , the bow will be in two different positions , why don &apos;t you ?
I mean , it &apos;s just my logic .
so think about what it would look like if you could be in multiple positions at the same time .
what would your cognitive mind handle your own <unk> problem in the universe ?
this is a part of the story .
when we heat it up , and we open it up , and we see that the beam still remains one .
so I had to create a new instinct , and it seemed that all the objects in the elevator were actually tucked in a tiny space .
you &apos;ve heard a lot about how quantum physics is interconnected .
well , that &apos;s not exactly right .
it has to be broader , more profound .
and that &apos;s the connection , the way you connect to those around you , the real definition of who you are , and that &apos;s the deep science of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , I think we needed to reinvent the concept of economic development in our consciousness .
our goal is to work in places where each family thinks about where they &apos;re working and what they &apos;re doing , and they have at least five different places where they can choose to be competitive , new cities .
we have a long way to go .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t have a city that will embrace them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that it &apos;s much more valuable than just how much value it is to build .
so we can easily create a few tens of thousands of miles , or hundreds of miles around the world .
you may think that sounds ridiculous if you &apos;ve never considered a <unk> .
but this is just instead of <unk> buildings .
half of all the people who wanted to live in the apartment were already there ; half of them weren &apos;t there .
you can ask for an extension of the house to scale .
but you know that the housing and the surrounding site is highly protected by legal and entertaining buildings .
it &apos;s very difficult to do these things .
but you can create a new building in uncharted territory , like the beginning of the <unk> .
so I proposed that the government would set up enough of the new areas of the city , and call it the Charter of Compassion .
and at the same time , the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> are thinking about planning in Honduras .
it &apos;s said that about 600,000 migrants a year come to the United States and they want to ask , what can they do to make sure that these people stay in Honduras &apos; job as well .
and one time the <unk> said to the Tower , &quot; What if we were to take our site out of the ground -- if we were to give it to the embassy -- some of the American Embassy &apos;s -- if we wanted to find jobs in Canada or the United States , where would they find their way to work ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , Honduras had a military coup .
in the next level , the followed by election , election reform and peace talks won the overwhelming advantage of that .
he invited the <unk> tower to be his <unk> .
at the same time , I was preparing a TEDTalk .
with a series of improvements , a lot of users , I tried to take the idea of this Charter , the complex idea of <unk> the most fundamental idea .
the first is that the significance of the law , as it said , is that you can &apos;t harassed by the state of the state .
we &apos;re focusing on new technologies , but new technologies require technologies and demand to be implemented , often the ones that need to pull us back .
in 2010 , a friend of mine sent this request to a TEDTalk .
he showed it to the <unk> .
they called me up .
say , &quot; Let &apos;s show this to our president . &quot;
we touched the conference room in Miami in December .
I &apos;m trying to explain how much the value of the city is and how much it costs to use it .
and I showed this slide to some of the value of an area like New York where there &apos;s an area where there &apos;s an <unk> site .
but it &apos;s a relatively abstract discussion where some <unk> said , &quot; Paul , maybe we can watch a TEDTalk . &quot;
now , in a nutshell , the Magna Carta for the Charter for Compassion begins with an uninhabited site , <unk> <unk> , and they chose to live in the next place .
and the president of Honduras asked me the question , who said that we need this project , and that &apos;s the key to the way we move forward .
I was invited to visit <unk> , and on January 4 , June 4th .
I showed you another example of this slide , and I tried to talk about it , and if you wanted to create a huge value in the city , it had to be huge .
this is a picture of <unk> , and this is an airport in Stanford .
there are more than 100 square kilometers of these single airports .
I tried to convince the President of Honduras , if you &apos;re going to build a <unk> square @-@ kilometer @-@ long square .
that &apos;s bigger than 2,500 acres .
everyone was very polite .
the expression of the audience is serious and suspicious .
and the President of the meeting said , &quot; <unk> , thank you very much , but maybe we can take a TEDTalk .
I &apos;ve got one on my laptop now . &quot;
so I sat down , and they watched a TEDTalk .
it also captured the essence of the new city , and it gave people a new choice .
this is an option that you would go to cities , maybe to Honduras instead of the <unk> .
it also gave leadership new choices .
because the leaders of Honduras &apos; government need a universal help of the Charter to help them set up and enforce the Charter that will allow everybody to believe that the Charter will actually act .
the lesson of the president of the president is the ability to ensure that I believe that as a way to attract people to build cities that should be as important as the ones that have been taken place in Honduras .
we field the field .
this is a photograph there .
that &apos;s one thousand square kilometers .
not long after , on January 19 , they voted in Congress to provide a legal support for specific development .
in this country where there was a coup government , Congress known as <unk> 1 .
in society , all the parties have supported it .
as part of the Constitution , you actually have to go through Congress twice .
and on February 17th , they passed the bill from January 17 .
and immediately after the vote , on February 21 to 24 , about 30 individual veterans come to the world &apos;s two of the most interesting areas .
one was Korea .
this is a big , new downtown town -- bigger than Boston .
all you &apos;ve seen has been built for four years , but they &apos;ve spent four years building .
another attractive construction sector is Singapore .
they actually built two <unk> in China and are ready to build the third .
and if you think about it rationally , that &apos;s where we are .
they had Ground Zero , and they thought of it as the second city .
they &apos;re entering an envelope with a legal system for the managers and the legal system as well .
one country has committed the Supreme Court for the new justice system and ultimately the accepted court .
this is a city designer and an architect who &apos;s interested in it .
these can even afford their economic support .
but one of the things that you knew was that there was a lot of <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of businesses that want to go there to the United States , especially to the free trade , and a lot of them want to go there .
there are seven billion people around the world who want to be forever immigrants to some other places .
one million people went from Latin America every year .
a lot of it is the father who is looking for work -- sometimes a single mother to earn money for housing .
sadly , sometimes kids try to stay with their parents for a long time , for decades .
how does it take to think about building a <unk> in Honduras ?
or have you built tens of thousands of these hundreds of them around the world ?
and how does that come to mind that every family has a number of options that attract new families to find ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends of mine gave me a thank you for TED .
hello . my name is Kevin <unk> . I &apos;m a YouTube <unk> , and my profession is YouTube .
this is real .
so today we &apos;re going to talk about why some of this video is going to be online and even important .
we all wanted to be a celebrity -- celebrity , hero , comedian -- and when I was young , it was very difficult .
but now online video is making it real , so we can all be creative to do what we want to do , and then suddenly become part of the world .
any of you could be famous on the Internet , on Saturday .
but there &apos;s over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
in many , only one in many cases has been shown to rise and rise of the deaths and rise to a culture of <unk> .
how does that happen ?
three keys : <unk> , community engagement and unexpected .
okay , let &apos;s see .
the bear <unk> : Oh , my God . Oh my God . Oh my God .
Oh , my God !
ooh !
Oh , Whoa !
last year , Mr. <unk> <unk> , upload this video that was taken from his <unk> park .
in 2010 , this video was watched three million times .
this is a graph showing you the situation where the video just happened .
but the bear didn &apos;t have to photograph what was happening in the video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because this is what the person who claimed to be called the <unk> .
he also upload a lot of video games .
this video was actually uploaded in January last year .
so what happened ?
that &apos;s Jimmy <unk> .
Jimmy Wales <unk> a tweet to the video .
because there are things like Jimmy Wales , and the leaders are starting to introduce us to novelty , interesting things , to get people to touch these things .
RG : today it &apos;s Friday , Friday , Friday . every one of you is looking forward to the weekends . every Friday , Friday .
<unk> <unk> &apos;s &quot; Friday &quot; was one of the Year &apos;s Eve .
this year almost 200 million views .
this chart shows the popular trend .
and this video , like , &quot; Mr. <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; it sort of <unk> out of nowhere .
what happened that day ?
Oh , that was the day , a Friday , really .
if you &apos;ve been wondering the peak , it &apos;s all on Friday .
but what happened on that day ?
it was chosen to buy it , and many of the tribes <unk> talked about it .
Michael Moriarty was <unk> at his <unk> .
the point is that there &apos;s a or a group of people who are starting to see the video then share their views , accelerating the video is red .
and it &apos;s a shared joke , and it &apos;s shared , not only that , but it &apos;s going to evolve its own version .
so there are tens of thousands of <unk> on &quot; Friday &quot; on YouTube .
and even on Monday , there &apos;s a different twist on the weekend .
unlike a one @-@ way entertainment media in the 20th century , this was a collective participation , where we became part of a common phenomenon -- through spread or creative innovation .
this &quot; <unk> &quot; is a continuous music series of <unk> .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s up to 50 million people a year .
if you think this is incredible , you &apos;re more likely to imagine this video , and there &apos;s another three @-@ hour version that draws four million people .
and even the <unk> watched this video .
the cat is watching this video .
but what &apos;s important about this is this technology of ideas , the technology of geeks , the Internet .
and we made vegetable beds .
somebody made a nostalgia .
and then walked the route .
and the whole <unk> of this is a single joke that we can all be part of .
because now we &apos;re not just <unk> , we &apos;re also involved .
who knew this ?
who knew that &quot; rainbow &quot; or <unk> ?
what kind of play do you write in it ?
and it took two days to see the Internet , only the ones that were unique and incredible enough to keep up .
and one of my friends recommended that a pretty good video was taken by a guy in New York City , and I had to admit I hadn &apos;t had any interest .
Casey <unk> : I have a ticket because I don &apos;t have a bicycle on the bike lanes , but often because a lot of obstacles don &apos;t even get you on the bike lanes .
Kevin : in an unexpected way , he made the idea and the argument that five million people showed .
and it works for every aspect of our innovation .
so let &apos;s have a question like this .
and Mr. <unk> <unk> : what does that mean ?
Oh ...
Kevin : what does that mean ?
the wave of ideas , the creative engagement groups , and the <unk> , these are the characteristics of new media and new media that people can participate in and define what &apos;s going on .
as I do , there &apos;s a <unk> now , Justin Bieber and a <unk> from YouTube .
your ideas don &apos;t need people .
we all have autonomy in popular culture .
but it &apos;s not the characteristics of the old media , nor is it the media , but it &apos;s going to be the entertainment of the future media .
thank you .
it was 10 minutes and three minutes enough to tell me that the link between the three women , the incredible strength of the ties with the four @-@ year @-@ olds , the grandmother , the grandmother , five days , a small boat in a boat , has been around for the last 30 years , in your own mind today .
a constant story .
it &apos;s like a puzzle that &apos;s being painted .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
the first image in retrospect was done by a guy .
he was a poet and a playwright who specialize in <unk> and freedom .
imagine him being a communist and having a complete denial of his life .
they were laughing at the joy of their friends .
he was quiet .
he &apos;s dead .
he was my grandfather .
I never knew his real life .
but our lives are richer than our memories .
my grandfather gave me his life .
and my responsibility was to keep him from being futile , and my responsibility was to learn from the fact that history tried to defeat us .
the next piece of the puzzle was the dawn of the morning , even to the sea .
my mother , <unk> , 18 @-@ year @-@ olds , had two young girls .
for her , the only purpose of my life was to flee families in Australia .
it was impossible for her .
so , four years of <unk> &apos;s story of <unk> novels , a boat @-@ boat @-@ boat @-@ breaking fishing .
big people know the danger .
the biggest threat was piracy , rape and death .
like all adults , my mother had a little poison .
if we were cremated , my sister , my mother and the grandmother .
my first memories came from a boat -- the motors , the <unk> , the flow of waves .
I don &apos;t remember the pirate supply going on a couple of times , but the man on the ship was scared , and the engine was turned around in six hours .
but I remember the trip to the <unk> <unk> <unk> of oil ; a man from the coast of Malaysia ; died early on ; the first apple , the first apple , a man from <unk> .
no longer eat that delicious apple .
three months after the prison camp , we settled in Melbourne .
the next piece of this puzzle is a new life of women in three generations .
we settled on <unk> , a working @-@ class suburban , dominated by migrants .
unlike the rest of suburbia , I forgotten my existence , let alone the right .
the taste of shop as if it came from another world .
speaking of the same language , people were interacting with each other , and one of the things was the same , and then started <unk> .
the mom started working in a village , and then went to the car for six days and a half days and a half .
and sometimes she would go and learn English and get the IT <unk> .
we &apos;re very poor .
save every single dollar . the rest of the money is used to tap into English and math , whether it &apos;s got any new clothes , wear clothes .
and when I went to school and I snuck in one of these caves .
the uniforms for school uniforms have been suspended from the knees for six years .
and it was a very small number of <unk> , but it was a line of graffiti that said , &quot; Asian people , go home . &quot;
where do you go home ?
something <unk> my mind .
a force pulls in , quiet sound says , &quot; I &apos;m going to pass you . &quot;
I , my sister and my mother slept in the same bed .
she wears home every night , but we talk to each other about one day , and we listen to the acoustic enclosure of the night sky .
my mother was suffering from a birth boat .
my job was to stay awake , wake her as a nightmare .
she started a computer store , she was learning how to build a <unk> .
there &apos;s no story about the man , no transition , anger , <unk> , problems of kids , like the two world .
find money and aid .
they built the center .
I live in a parallel world .
on the one hand , I &apos;m a typical Asian student , I found myself in special circumstances .
on the other hand , I went to the dangers of reality , the conflict of violence , the combination of drugs and apartheid .
but years of help .
I was selected as a young Australian <unk> for the first time .
I jumped right from one piece to the other , and there was no beautiful link .
<unk> <unk> is a private property , and now refugees , social activists are invited to speak , to a place where no one has ever heard .
I don &apos;t know the agreement .
I don &apos;t know how to use <unk> .
you don &apos;t talk about wine .
it &apos;s not speaking .
I wanted to go back to the past , the live days of suburbia -- the grandmother , the present and the two daughters had been around for 20 years , talking about each other , slowly sleep in bed .
I told my mother , I couldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that she took us a cruise abroad when I was my age right now .
no choice .
and she said , &quot; She &apos;s true . &quot;
so I talked about the job losses and the education issues of unemployment , and ignored the edges of politics .
the more honest I talked about , the more I talked about it .
people around the world , do what they like , what they live .
even though I had completed my studies , I realized I couldn &apos;t limit the law .
here &apos;s another puzzle clip .
at the same time , I realized that being an outsider can also , the latest thing , the news on the screen , is not just , there &apos;s some things that came from the boat .
because being a <unk> , it &apos;s easy to abandon your vision , it &apos;s easy to get your assumptions .
I &apos;ve got to stand right now in the comfort zone , and the world starts beating apart , not just because you &apos;re worried .
you don &apos;t allow the novelty to allow you to zoom in .
there &apos;s energy , the ruthless optimism , the combination of people and the courage .
follow my hunch .
I gathered together a group that said , &quot; <unk> &apos;t do &quot; was the only challenge .
for a year , we were not alone .
and at the end of the day , I do a whole series of people sharing .
every night , working .
most of our ideas are crazy , and a few of them are smart , and we breakthrough .
I felt moved to the United States .
after a trip .
and my intuition succeeded .
when I got to three months , I continued to take risks .
at the end , let me say my grandmother .
she grew up in the middle of a massive headwind , which was the largest nation .
there was no change in life for centuries .
her father died when she was born .
it was raised by the mother alone .
she married a woman who was 17 years old and was married to a <unk> .
there was no husband &apos;s support , taking her husband to the court , <unk> , winning her , <unk> .
impossible is possible .
and when she was in Melbourne around 600 miles , I was in a hotel in Sydney .
through the glass , I saw her standing across .
and I knew she was singing .
my mom &apos;s phone rang a few minutes later .
and a few days later , we went to the bedside console , and we sat next to her coffin .
we tell stories , and we promise her we &apos;re always with her .
and the night nurse told us that he had to cover the coffin .
my mother gave us a sense of the grandmother .
and she said , &quot; Why is it that the grandmother &apos;s hand is Van <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been on the morning since the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you never let go . &quot;
if we have mobility in our family , it must be women .
if we think about the fabric of ourselves and our lives , we can now see that a man has to cut us loose . we must be frustrated .
it &apos;s too easy to fail .
now I want my child , my own boat .
who would not ?
and I was afraid of privilege and privilege and power .
the oars of their lives , the brave <unk> , the ups and downs , the machines , the general field , the general vision , the generous vision , the scale of any kind , can I do that ?
I don &apos;t know .
but I can leave it alone and look at them safely , and that &apos;s what I want .
and at the same time , this is where we are today , where we have the fourth and the <unk> .
I &apos;d like to share with you today my photography .
or is this a photographic work ?
because , of course , this is obviously a photo , but it &apos;s a photo you didn &apos;t have with the camera .
however , my interest in photography started when I got the first digital cameras .
it was in my passion for painting , but it was a little different , because the actual process of using the camera is already ahead .
and when you take a camera and you shoot the camera at the end of the shoot .
so it seemed to me that photography was more about location and time .
I think anyone can do it .
so I wanted to do something special , and it was that when you did finish the shoot .
this is a photo : a busy highway is moving .
it was a very unusual way .
still , it remains a sense of <unk> .
or there &apos;s a photograph like this , which has color , but it &apos;s all about trying to preserve a sense of <unk> .
what I &apos;m talking about is the probability of the image .
because it &apos;s not something you can actually hold , but I always wanted to make it look like you could get caught in some way .
these pictures require you to quickly identify the skills behind them .
so what &apos;s more about it is capturing a moment of inspiration than capturing a moment of real existence .
but what does it take to make these pictures look realistic ?
what about the details ? what about color ?
or is it about light ?
what caused this illusion ?
sometimes a different perspective causes different hallucinations .
but ultimately , it &apos;s important to note how we understand the world and how we understand it in a two @-@ dimensional space .
it &apos;s not about what it is , it &apos;s about what we think looks like .
so I think these principles are simple .
and I think of it as a kind of a puzzle in the real world , where you can combine different pieces of the real world together and create another reality .
let me give you a simple example .
there are three things that can be imagined and real , and we can find them in a three @-@ dimensional world .
but if you combine these objects in a way , you can create a visual object that &apos;s still three @-@ dimensional , as if it &apos;s possible .
but at the same time , we know it &apos;s not possible .
and we &apos;re cheating our own brain , because the brain isn &apos;t really there .
and this is what happens .
it &apos;s just a combination of different things .
so what makes a photo look like is something that we normally don &apos;t even think of , but we live in the world .
but when we combine that , it &apos;s worth remembering that otherwise it would be a bit freaky .
and what I want to suggest is that we have to follow three simple principles that work in order to achieve that kind of thing .
you see , these images are not special .
but together they can create this .
so the first principle is that all of the photographs that are taken together show the same view .
secondly , the same amount of light that comes together .
both of these pictures were exactly the same , and they were asked to be taken from the same height and the same amount of light .
and the third principle is , it &apos;s hard to figure out the bridges that make the bridge look like these .
it doesn &apos;t make any sense to any of you .
by matching the colors of the photo array , the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the photo array , the depth and the noise of the eye , we can take away the boundary between a different picture and make it look like a single photo , even though it contains hundreds of photos .
here &apos;s another example .
some of you might think that &apos;s just a piece of paper underneath it .
but this photograph was actually taken from many different places .
and I personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place than to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to match your own mind .
but this really requires a lot of planning .
and when this came to mind in the last winter , I knew that I had a couple of months to plan this thing , basically , to get a picture of what the puzzle needed .
for example , this fish was <unk> .
the Coast was taken from another location .
the underwater part of it was a quarry .
and by the way , I put it in red , and it makes it look more wind .
in order to do that , what I think is most important is plan .
it &apos;s always going to come up with the idea and the idea .
and that &apos;s a different picture .
every one of these pictures is taken very carefully .
if you could get a good photo , it would be a beautiful thing , and it looked like something .
so all of the tools that we have in that limit are our imagination .
thank you .
I want to talk to you about why a lot of digital healthcare projects failed .
and one of the things that I think is most important is that we don &apos;t listen to patients .
one of the things that we did at the University of Holland was appointed a <unk> .
not in a very scientific way -- she asked the coffee or the tea , the family , the relatives , the family ?
what needs us ? &quot;
and I think that &apos;s one of the main reasons why we don &apos;t hear this , I think , that &apos;s one of the main reasons why we don &apos;t listen to this .
this is my weight gain , which is a very simple thing .
there &apos;s a switch .
I weigh it every morning .
<unk> , I set myself a slot for what you see .
I set the weight up .
in fact , the whole operation was so simple that I could just send my data to Google Health .
and at the same time , I was able to get the weight of my doctor , and then he could see what was wrong with my weight , not when he had a heart attack , but when he had a heart attack , it was all the way .
but here &apos;s another thing .
some of you may know that I have <unk> fans on Twitter .
so every morning I weigh my weight , and before I get in my van , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you &apos;re lunch today , or Jane . &quot;
but that &apos;s a great thing , because it &apos;s a peer @-@ to @-@ peer pressure that helps patients -- it helps to treat obesity .
but on the other hand , it can also bring people together to some kind of play @-@ like games to make it better to keep it healthy .
the next week , the next week , we &apos;re about to take this off .
there would be a little <unk> that would link to a smartphone or something like this , and it would actually happen .
and then people would measure their blood pressure and send it to their doctor , and they would share it with other people for $ 100 .
and that &apos;s the key thing , when the patient is collecting data , they &apos;re not only able to self @-@ control , they are able to deal with the challenges that we have in our care , like the cost of medicine , or the cost of the treatment , etc .
we &apos;re going to make it easy to get the technology right into the track .
you can do this with technology , and you can organize the task to ordinary people .
today I &apos;m going to show you a project that we did .
we have mobile devices in our cars .
and even the mobile phone .
we know where the ATM machines are .
you know where the gas station is .
of course , fast food .
but where &apos;s the <unk> of the patients recently ?
and we were everywhere , and no one knew .
nobody knew what it would do to save the lives of the <unk> .
we sent the whole assignment to the Dutch people .
we built a website to tell people , &quot; If you look at an <unk> , please place it outside the Web and park it for 24 hours because it doesn &apos;t open .
in the Netherlands , we have <unk> tagged .
the next step is to develop applications .
we developed an iPad .
an app for <unk> , for <unk> , for finding <unk> .
if you see someone in <unk> , you can actually use an iPhone in a couple of weeks , and Microsoft has actually found the latest <unk> to save lives .
what I want to talk to you about today is not just <unk> , it &apos;s the name of that product and the <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to push this project around the world .
and we &apos;re also calling to colleagues and universities all over the world to help us pull together and <unk> around the world .
and when you go out and you see someone standing outside and you may be your family or your way , and you can find your family .
and here we also wanted to call for every company in the world to be able to test these results .
like , maybe sending a gun or a <unk> to see if the flag was still there .
so please , in this case , help us not only make us healthy , but we can take advantage of it .
thank you .
today , I &apos;m going to talk about some unexpected discoveries .
now I &apos;m working on solar energy .
and I was just starting a little company that was trying to force us to come up with a natural way .
you can see the <unk> .
this is a video of what we &apos;re doing .
ah , wait a minute .
loaded video takes some time .
maybe we can skip -- I &apos;ll skip the video .
don &apos;t .
this is not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
don &apos;t you , my time has gone ?
all right , thank you very much .
a few years ago , I started a project where some of the most incredible people were using technology and design were working in a place where they were meant to represent all of the circumstances that they hate -- government @-@ government programs for a year .
this project is called &quot; The American Code , &quot; a little bit like <unk> .
we take a couple of people a year , and we make them work for governments .
not to send them to the third world , but to the city council .
and there , they created great apps , and they worked with the city council .
but the real goal is to show the possibility that technology can create today .
this is Al .
Al is a fire hydrant .
it looks like it &apos;s waiting for its date , but what it &apos;s really waiting for is a human being that can break it up when it &apos;s frozen , because it knows that when it &apos;s four feet tall , it &apos;s going to fall down .
how does it work in this particular way ?
last year we said , &quot; The United States Code , &quot; and there &apos;s a team at <unk> .
they were in February at the time of February , and there was a lot of them last February .
they noticed that the fires of this city rarely dug .
and one of the guys in that group , Erik <unk> -- he &apos;s got another phenomenon : the citizens would knock out the ice out on the front of the fire hydrant .
so he did what any good programmer would do , and he wrote an app .
this is a pretty straightforward program for you to adopt a fire hydrant .
and then you agreed to open it up after snow .
if you did that , you could give it a name ; he called the first Al .
but if you don &apos;t have it , others can steal it from you .
so there &apos;s a little bit of entertainment inside .
this is a relatively small program .
it was perhaps the smallest act of the team that wrote that year .
but it did something that any other government could not do .
it &apos;s like a virus .
one of the IT departments in Honolulu , in Honolulu , in Honolulu , has seen this program , and realized that it doesn &apos;t have to be able to use it to remove the snow , and it can use it to pump the citizen alarm .
the tsunami &apos;s function is important , but people steal the battery inside .
so he asked citizens to check them .
and then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clean up the sewer channels .
and Chicago started using it to get people out of the mountains .
we now know there are nine cities to use it .
it just <unk> , organic , natural , spread out .
if you know something about government , you know , it &apos;s not common .
it takes a few years to build a piece of software .
last year we had a team of three people working on a project for two and a half months .
it can help parents decide which public schools are the best for their children .
and then we were told , if this project was in the normal channel , it would take at least two years , and it would take about two million dollars .
and this is just a small number .
California &apos;s a project that costs 20 billion dollars now , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are all kinds of projects in government .
so a program that takes just a few days to program , and it &apos;s like a viral @-@ like program , and it &apos;s a <unk> for the government .
it &apos;s seen that government can be more efficient , but not more like private companies , like many people think .
it wasn &apos;t even like a tech company , but it was more like a network .
that means you &apos;re not going to be able to implement it .
and that &apos;s important .
but what this program represents , more importantly , is that the next generation of people are looking at the problem of the government as a group of issues , not a single institution .
and that &apos;s a great message , because , as it turns out , we &apos;re very good at the technology community .
there &apos;s now a very large community building tools that allow us to do things more efficiently .
it &apos;s not just the people in the United States code , there are hundreds of people in the country who write and code each day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up government .
and while they were disappointed , they weren &apos;t complaining , and they were trying to improve it .
these people know something we &apos;ve lost .
and that &apos;s when you peel away all of our anger &apos;s skin , things like our sense of politics , and the long lines outside of the vehicle , the government , in the center of it , Tim Berners @-@ Lee , said , &quot; Well , the government can do something for us . &quot;
there are a lot of people who are totally overwhelmed by the government .
if you &apos;re one of them , I want you to think about it , because a lot of things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change , but governments are changing .
and because of the power of government , from the very fundamental source of energy comes from our people , how we see it will affect its transformation .
when I started this project , I didn &apos;t know much about government .
like a lot of people , I think the government is just a selection staff .
two years later , I got a message : government , particularly local government , is about security .
here &apos;s the phone center for service and information recall The Center .
if you call it a <unk> in your city , you &apos;re going to be connected to this .
if you had the chance to work at your center in the city center of the city , colleagues like our project did this -- in fact , they all had to do this service -- you would find that people would call up the government for a very different problem , including a family .
Scott got this call .
he put the word &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official code .
nothing . he begins in the animal center .
and in the end , he said , &quot; Well , you can open up all your door and open it up with a lot of music , and see if it &apos;s going to go away ? &quot;
and that worked . Scott , <unk> .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the story .
and there were no waiting spots .
it has a program , a website and a mobile project called <unk> .
we didn &apos;t write that program .
it &apos;s a group of really smart people writing in a new city hall .
there was a day when the release came out -- and the message came out : &quot; there was a trash can &apos;t see if it was dead .
how do I take it off ? &quot;
citizens connected to this problem in a different way .
Scott had a conversation about people earlier .
but it &apos;s all open @-@ ended , so everyone can see it .
this time , a neighbor saw it .
the next report we got was this : &quot; I walked by this place and found the trash from the house .
and I said , &quot; Yes , I &apos;m alive . &quot;
put it in the trash . go home .
and I said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
so that &apos;s good . this is the intersection between reality and digital world .
it &apos;s also a great example of how government plays an <unk> game .
but it &apos;s also a great example of a government @-@ government movement .
and I &apos;m not here to suggest the definition of the platform .
I just want to mention a platform where people can help each other .
a citizen helped another citizen , and the government plays the role of it .
it just kind of melted itself .
it can be used by government services to help people , but a neighbor is far more simple and affordable .
and when one of our neighborhoods help another , our social links expanded .
we call the <unk> Center for <unk> , and we pay a lot of money .
one of the things that we need to think about is the government is not the politics .
a lot of people understand this , but they still think that politics is the input of government .
our input from the government system is through the ballot .
so far , how much political leaders we &apos;ve chosen , and sometimes we spend a lot of our energy trying to support a new political leader -- and then we expect government to do something that reflects our values and what we need , but not much change at all .
that &apos;s because governments are like a huge ocean , and politics is just one layer above the top .
and here &apos;s what we call the <unk> .
we talked about it in such a way .
but it was this desire that we had and paid for what we were paying for , and we were losing our own energy .
people seem to think that politics is sexy .
if we want the department to serve us , we have to get sexual pleasure from being sexy .
because the real government is there .
we have to participate in government systems .
and this is what the United States National Security Agency does .
have you ever met these people ?
they were an incredibly geeky group of citizens , and they wrote a very detailed , reporting of <unk> pages to respond to the U.S. <unk> Council .
it &apos;s not about participation , it &apos;s about engagement .
now , for those of us who have given up government , it &apos;s time to ask ourselves what kind of world we want to leave our children .
you have to realize that they have to face a huge challenge .
do we really believe that we can achieve what we want to accomplish before we do it ?
we can &apos;t have government . we need it to be more efficient .
and the good news is that technology is taking this as a building that is fundamentally capable of redefining government functions and we can use it to enhance our citizens .
now the next generation is growing up in the Web , and they know it &apos;s not that hard to do at the same time , just to build systems .
the average age of our staff was 28 years old , so I was very privileged , almost more than most of them .
this generation has become used to them .
they don &apos;t have to go through our generation to talk about who can have free speech ; they all have free speech .
they can talk to them through any channel at any given time , and they do .
so when they faced a flaw in government , they didn &apos;t care about using their own voice .
they use their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write software that makes government work better .
and these programs allow us to use our own hands to perfect our society .
it could be designed to take a fire hydrant , a grass , or a trash could put in a trash could .
of course , a lot of people were starting to excavate the fire hydrant .
but these programs are like a small alarm clock , and you can remind us that we &apos;re not just consumers , we &apos;re not just consumers of government consumption , we &apos;re not just taxes on our phones .
we &apos;re not just that , we &apos;re citizens .
before we improve government , we have to take our responsibility as citizens .
so here &apos;s the question I leave you with : when we &apos;re confronted with something big , important , and we need to do it together , we &apos;re going to have a group of individuals , or we &apos;re going to be a <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be a community of people who are working together ?
thank you .
and since I &apos;ve been explaining to people how wonderful this new technology is going to come , I think since I &apos;ve been with the people that I &apos;ve been working with , let me suggest that my real idea and trying to look at and understand how this is happening , it &apos;s going to happen . technology seems to be pretty dramatic .
let me start with a very boring scientific slide .
and you can start off the slide .
this is just a random sample of my file .
what I want you to see is not the details , but the overall form .
this is a slide that we did on the <unk> Model <unk> with local power .
what &apos;s interesting is that the slide I showed you , like many of the familiar slides , is a semi @-@ log straight line .
that &apos;s each layer here , representing the level of performance .
on a semi @-@ log plot , it &apos;s fresh .
this is a bit of a surprise .
that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to say .
take a break .
just flash them up , because I &apos;m going to use a piece of paper .
why should we use the <unk> curve to describe the technology curve ?
well , the answer is , if I use regular curves , we say , this is the year , this is the time , this is a measurement of technology that I &apos;m about to draw , and it looks a little silly .
it &apos;s like that .
and there &apos;s no information .
now , if I do , for example , another technology , like transportation , a semi @-@ log plot , it looks like a <unk> line .
but if there was something like this , then it happened .
if transportation advances have happened as fast as the original technology , then I could <unk> a cab on a taxi and then in 30 seconds to Tokyo .
but it didn &apos;t grow so fast .
there was no self @-@ sustaining in the history of technology , at least twice as many years as growth .
now what I want to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they &apos;re not sustainable .
things can &apos;t change that fast .
two things happen .
or it turns into a typical S @-@ curves like this to a completely different situation , or something like this .
that &apos;s all possible .
now I &apos;m an optimist , so I think it &apos;s possible to be .
and if that &apos;s true , it means that what we &apos;re at the moment is <unk> .
we seem to be on that line , in the world &apos;s transition from the past to the future .
all I have to ask , I &apos;ve been asking myself , what is the future of the world ?
what would it look like to be a new age ?
because the change seemed to be very , very confusing , when we were in the middle of it .
I grew up talking about what would happen in the next year 2000 .
now at this conference , you &apos;re talking about the future , and you can see that the future is 2000 .
that &apos;s how far we can get .
in other words , the future of my life is shrinking .
and I think the reason is that we all feel what &apos;s happening .
the change is happening . we can see .
we know that for the next three , 50 years , there &apos;s no sense , because everything is going to be so different that no longer exists .
so I &apos;m going to talk about what that means , and what is the transition that we &apos;re going to experience .
to do that , I have to introduce a whole bunch of things that are completely different from technology and computers .
because the only way I decided to understand this is to go way back to the time of the timeline .
and the time I &apos;m going to look at is the timeline of life on Earth .
and I think this picture makes sense if you look at it for billions of years .
so if you look back in about 25 billion years , the Earth is this big , barren rock with these chemicals .
if we look at how these chemicals combine , we start to figure out how they work .
and I think there &apos;s some theories about how life started from RNA , but I want to tell you a simple story about life , which was that , at that time , there were hundreds of thousands of tons of different chemicals in it .
some oil droplet has a special chemistry inside that makes it possible for them to concentrate chemicals from the outside .
the oil droplet starts to differentiate and starts to differentiate .
the most primitive of all , in a way , formed cells , the little oil droplet .
but these oil prices aren &apos;t really alive now , because each of these is a random chemical .
every once in split , it &apos;s not an average @-@ based chemistry .
so each oil droplet has a bit different .
in fact , the difference with oil prices is to make them more soluble , more potent , more potent , more divided , more divided .
so they &apos;re much more effective , much more acting .
it &apos;s a bit like a very simple chemical form of life , but the process of getting interesting is when the oil droplet gets involved in producing information .
we don &apos;t know how to record information in a completely different way .
they learn to cover the structure of the cells into a special material called <unk> .
in other words , they came up with this sort of evolutionary way that we could write down their genetic information so that it could be copied in this way .
and the surprise is that this type of record seemed to last 25 million years .
in fact , our genes are the same code , the same way .
in fact , any organism is written in a completely identical letter and code .
in fact , one of the things I &apos;ve done for the entertainment is that we can use this code .
I &apos;ve got 100 pairs of <unk> , and I &apos;m trying to figure them out .
but what I &apos;ve done here is I take this code , and it has the criteria that we use to tag it , and then I write my business card to an oxygen bar , and I write it down to 10 to 22 times .
so if somebody needs millions of my business card , I &apos;ve got enough money to give everyone in this room , even everyone around the world .
if I was a proud person , I would put it in a virus and into a room .
so what &apos;s next ?
it &apos;s a really interesting way to get to this place .
it causes cells to form -- and it makes them happy billions of years .
but there &apos;s another really interesting component that begins to be very different , and that is that these cells start exchanging and communicating information to form cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , that bacteria can actually exchange for oxygen .
and that &apos;s why , for example , an evolutionary <unk> .
some bacteria know how to stay out of penicillin , and then it creates this oxygen that goes away and goes around in other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacterial resources for penicillin , because the bacteria communicate information .
so , these communication communities form , in a sense , they &apos;re in the same boat ; they &apos;re collaborative .
so they survive or die together , which means that if a community is successful , all the individuals in the community can replicate more , evolution is much more favorable .
and so , the transition from that , when these groups are very close , they actually gather together and decided to write an essential piece of bone in a non @-@ African group .
the next interesting stage in life is over billions of years .
during this period , there are many cells , many different types of cells , as organisms , to collaborate with organisms .
in fact , that &apos;s how many cells we have .
we have a lot of cells ; they &apos;re not just living for themselves .
the skin doesn &apos;t work . if you don &apos;t have the heart cells , the muscle cells , the brain cells , etc .
so these groups started to evolve , and the interesting evolution of these groups was no longer just single cells , but we call them organisms .
and that &apos;s what happens in these groups .
these cells , again , start to extract information .
they &apos;re starting to build very specific structures in the community .
these are nerves .
so neurons are the kind of processing equipment that these cells have .
in fact , there are experts in the community , and there are particular structures that are responsible for understanding and learning .
this is the brain and the nervous system of these cells .
this gives them the evolution of evolution .
because then , for each individual -- learning can happen in a single organism , not a whole evolutionary time .
so an organism can , for example , learn to eat some kind of fruit , because it &apos;s not a good thing and it &apos;s disgusting .
this could happen in a single organism , and then it would evolve thousands of years before this particular information structure , thousands of years , by eating this type of fruit .
so the nervous system , of course , is creating this special structure that has accelerated evolution .
because that &apos;s where evolution can happen .
it can happen in time for learning .
but what happened next was that each individual discovered , of course , the secret of communication .
for example , the most sophisticated version we know is human language .
think about it . it &apos;s an amazing invention .
I had a complicated , chaotic , chaotic thought .
I &apos;m sitting here , basically , <unk> sound , hoping to create a sort of chaotic form in your mind .
but we &apos;re transforming complex things into sound , through a series of sound , and creating complex things in your brain .
so it &apos;s now pushing us on as a single organism .
so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humans , start blocking .
we &apos;re at the same stage as multi @-@ cellular organisms -- taking our records and showing us how we process information .
for example , the invention of language is a very small step .
phone , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on , are the special mechanisms that we &apos;re creating in our society for dealing with information .
all of this is connecting us , changing faster and faster than we were before .
so , evolution can now be on a subtle <unk> scale .
you &apos;ve seen that little example of evolution that &apos;s sort of evolved to show a little bit of evolution in front of you .
so now we &apos;re going to accelerate time .
the first step that I told you about is spending billions of years .
the next step , like the nervous system and the brain , takes millions of years .
and then , like language and so forth , it takes less than a million years .
the next step , like the electronics , is like a matter of decades .
and the process is self @-@ sustaining , and becoming , I guess , the self @-@ obsession is more appropriate -- when things change faster .
the more the change , the faster it changed .
and I think that &apos;s what we see here .
we see the process giving back to ourselves .
my job right now is to design computers , and I know that the mechanisms to design computers don &apos;t exist , if you don &apos;t have any more recent computers .
now , what I do is I design complexity to objects that are not designed to be designed in the traditional sense .
I don &apos;t know the role of connection to the machine .
there are billions of <unk> .
in fact , what I do , what designers do , what we think we do , is we take it for some kind of information , and then we send it to the machine , and the machines use it to the range of what we can do , and it &apos;s even faster than what we &apos;ve ever done .
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s done , we don &apos;t understand very well .
and one of the things that I &apos;ve been working on recently is evolution itself .
what we do is we put a evolution process in the machine , and it happens in a subtle amount of time .
for example , in most extreme situations , we can actually evolve a program from random instructions .
say , &quot; computer , please create a billion random instructions .
now let &apos;s run all of these random instructions , run all the mechanical programs and pick them up the one that I want . &quot;
in other words , I define what I want .
suppose I need to categorize data , which is a simple example of what I &apos;ve experimented with .
find the most close @-@ knit program .
and of course , the random instructions don &apos;t divide up , so none of them can do it .
but there &apos;s one in the middle , and it &apos;s good , and it probably takes two numbers .
I said , &quot; computer , please , 10 percent of what you do right now .
save it . delete it .
now the best ones to copy this material .
and then re @-@ <unk> them with something like this .
take two programmers exchange for their children , these inherited two traits .
so I got a new generation of programmers doing well .
say , &quot; Please repeat this process . &quot;
do it again .
maybe introduce some mutations .
let &apos;s try it again in a new generation .
each of these generations requires a few milliseconds .
so I &apos;ve been able to do this on a couple of minutes with the evolution of millions of years , or , really complex , in a matter of hours .
at the end of the day , I was able to get the perfect <unk> program .
in fact , these programs are much more effective than any kind of programming I have .
now , if I read these programs , I don &apos;t tell you how they work .
I tried to read and explain how they work .
they &apos;re abstract . they &apos;re strange .
but they can do the task .
in fact , I know that I &apos;m confident that they can do the task , because they come from a line where millions of programmers can actually agree .
in fact , their life is the work .
I had a 747 with <unk> , and he pulled out a single card and said , &quot; Look , look at this .
it says , &quot; The aircraft has a lot of complex parts to do to keep you safe . &quot; is that what makes you confident ? &quot;
in fact , we know that engineering complexity doesn &apos;t really work very well .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a very different process .
it allows us to produce more complex things than normal projects .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand that .
in a sense , computers are way ahead of us .
we &apos;re using these now to create faster computers , so we can run faster .
so it &apos;s self @-@ feedback .
it &apos;s getting faster , and that &apos;s why I think computers seem to be pretty annoying .
all of these technologies give back to themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and we &apos;re just at one point in time , which is kind of like a single cell organism that is turning into multiple cells .
we &apos;re kind of like amoeba <unk> . there &apos;s something we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re at the tipping point .
but I think there must be something with us .
I think it &apos;s a cult of our ultimate invention of evolution .
I think all of us are part of a <unk> , whatever next .
it &apos;s going to happen , and I &apos;m not picked up , I think I &apos;m going to end up here .
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
I was mostly in prison , in prison , on death row .
I spent most of my time in low @-@ income communities working in a place of desperation , working on projects that came out of nowhere .
and I &apos;ve been to TED today to see these fascinating talks that I &apos;ve given .
and in that moment , I noticed that TED has its own place .
you can see what &apos;s happening here .
sometimes when things happened on the TED stage , there &apos;s a lot more to it than anywhere else .
and I mention this because I think the position is important .
we &apos;ve heard some fantastic talks .
we &apos;ve learned that as a teacher , you &apos;ve got influence , and if you &apos;re a very charitable teacher , you &apos;re willing to teach them in an act .
as a doctor , you can help people , if you &apos;re a medical doctor , you can help more .
so I want to talk about the importance of finding .
I don &apos;t learn from being a lawyer or a lawyer or anything else .
I actually learned it from my grandmother .
my family was a traditional black family , and there was only one <unk> , my grandmother .
she was tough . she was tough .
she has a fight , she has an opinion .
but a lot of things happened to her .
her parents were the real <unk> .
in the 1980s , her parents were very upset .
my grandmother was a born @-@ in @-@ the @-@ 1980s and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ Canadian experience in the world .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also very strong .
when I was a little boy , every time I saw her , she hugged me .
so she &apos;s holding it , and I &apos;m just going to let it go .
a couple of hours later , when I was bye , she would come and ask me , &quot; Can I feel my hug ? &quot;
and if I say , &quot; I can &apos;t feel anything , she &apos;ll just let go . &quot;
she was the ability to get close to her .
the only challenge was she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of 10 .
it &apos;s very hard to notice when I go to the grandmother and to the grandmother .
my family was everywhere .
and I remember , one of the things I remember when I woke up in the morning , I was running into the living room .
my grandmother was sitting on the opposite side of my room .
at first I thought we were playing games .
I went back , and I smiled , but my grandmother was serious .
about 15 or so later , she stood up and she walked across the room and she said to me , &quot; Here , Brian , we have to talk about it . &quot;
it &apos;s like it happened yesterday .
I &apos;ll never stop .
and she took me to the side and she said , &quot; I want to say something to you , you can &apos;t tell anyone . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Yes , my grandmother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; <unk> &apos;t say anything . &quot; and I said , &quot; promise . &quot;
and we sat down , and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to see me for a while . &quot;
and she said , &quot; You &apos;re a special child . &quot;
she said , &quot; I &apos;m sure you do anything . &quot;
I &apos;ll never forget that .
and she said , &quot; I want you to guarantee three things . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK , my grandmother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; First , I want you to ensure that you will always love your mother . &quot;
she said , &quot; You &apos;re my mom , you &apos;ve got to make sure you &apos;re going to love her forever . &quot;
I love my mom , and I said , &quot; OK , my grandmother , I will . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; The second thing you have to agree to me is that you &apos;re going to always go for a walk , even if it &apos;s a difficult choice . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; OK , my grandmother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; The third thing , I want you to keep breathing . &quot;
I was nine years old , and I said , &quot; OK , my grandmother , I promise . &quot;
I grew up in the countryside in the south , and I had a brother , and I had a one @-@ year @-@ old sister .
and one day my brother took me back to the <unk> beer -- and I didn &apos;t know what he was -- he took me and my sister , and he went to the trees .
he went mad .
he drank a beer . he handed my sister , and she drank it , and they hands me .
I said , &quot; I don &apos;t want it . you drink . I don &apos;t drink . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; Come to us that we have drunk most of our time today .
I drank a little bit , and my sister drank a little bit , and you were freezing . &quot;
and I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want to drink . you drink it . &quot;
my brother <unk> me .
ask , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? drink a little bit . &quot;
and then he looked at me for a moment , and he said , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re not thinking about raising my grandmother . &quot;
and I said , &quot; What are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; <unk> and every <unk> said he was special . &quot;
I &apos;m sad .
now I want to make a confession to you .
maybe not .
because it &apos;s going to be everywhere .
I took a break this year , and I &apos;m going to admit to you that I never had a drop of wine .
it &apos;s not about exposing myself to the power of defining self @-@ awareness .
and when we decided to identify the right thing , we could get the world around them .
we can make the world do what they couldn &apos;t do .
and when I came to my grandmother , she certainly felt that every single <unk> was special .
my grandfather was banned from prison .
I wasn &apos;t just a uncle who died and drunk disease .
all of these principles were my grandmother &apos;s belief that we should be .
what I want to talk to you about is our criminal law system .
and the country changed in 40 years .
in 1972 , only 300,000 people in prison .
today , there &apos;s <unk> .
today America is the highest proportion of people in the world .
we have seven million people , seven million people , seven million people in a time period of time .
and it seemed to me that a lot of these crimes have completely transformed our world .
in poor communities , in color communities , in color communities , despair has been transformed .
a third of all black men between 18 and 30 percent of black men are not in jail or in prison .
in urban communities all over the country -- Los Angeles , Baltimore , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of young people who are not in jail , are in short @-@ term situations .
our judicial system , not only changed , but <unk> around race , has twisted up around poverty .
the justice system in this country will respond to you if you &apos;re a convicted person , not an innocent person .
wealth , not failure , determines the end result .
and yet , we were quite comfortable with that .
playing with fear and anger , the wrist convinced us to do it .
and there was nothing left .
I was interested in this .
we see a little bit of a revolution in everyday work .
I &apos;m in Alabama , like a lot of other states , if you &apos;re sentenced to a life where you &apos;re convicted of political power .
now , 30 percent of all the black men in Alabama were never allowed to vote .
we &apos;re going to see 10 years from now , and this is going to be the same as the political rights bill .
and no one asked half .
I represent children .
many of my <unk> were young .
the United States is the only country in the world that can live in life where 13 years .
the life of my children , the life of their children , was still not very helpful .
we &apos;re actually just appeal to these people .
the world is full of products .
I was also a death row .
the death penalty was alarming .
the fundamental problem that we learn from all sorts of sources is that people tend to write their own crimes .
that &apos;s a perfectly reasonable question .
but the problem is our self @-@ portrait .
the other way to think about it is not that people tend to kill crimes , but that we don &apos;t deserve to kill them .
I mean , it &apos;s pretty shocking .
death penalty in the United States is always the result .
one out of nine people killed a death penalty would later be proven to have a death sentence .
this is a sign -- one in nine people were innocent .
I mean , it &apos;s pretty shocking .
the people who learned from aviation knew that if there was an accident in an airplane , we would certainly not let that go .
but it &apos;s too strange that we can avoid the death penalty problem .
because that &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our own problems .
it &apos;s not our own struggle .
I talked a lot about it .
race , and we don &apos;t deserve to be executed .
it &apos;s alarming . when I teach African @-@ American history , I talk to students about slavery .
and they talked to them about terrorism , which was the beginning of a great renaissance and World War II .
we don &apos;t really understand that history .
but for the black people in this country , that &apos;s a golden age .
in many communities , people were terrified of <unk> .
people worry about being attacked by bombs .
it changed their lives .
the man was now old , and he said to me , &quot; Mr. <unk> , you &apos;ve got to talk to you about , let alone 9 / 11 . &quot;
they let me say , &quot; We are born in horror . &quot;
that was the period of terrorism , of course , that ended up in the <unk> of decades of racism and apartheid .
however , our country doesn &apos;t like to talk about problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what we &apos;ve done .
we are constantly creating conflict .
we make intense atmosphere .
we can &apos;t talk about race , and I believe it &apos;s because we don &apos;t want to face a whole series of facts , we don &apos;t want to survive .
in South Africa , people know that we can &apos;t forget about apartheid unless we &apos;re honest with it .
in Rwanda , even after the genocide , people have faced it , but we don &apos;t want to .
I also talked about the death penalty problem in Germany .
and as a result of that , there &apos;s a fellow science standing up and saying , &quot; You know what , it &apos;s dreadful . &quot;
she said , &quot; We don &apos;t have a death penalty .
of course , our Germany could never have a death penalty . &quot;
and the woman said , &quot; Because of our history , we would never have decided to be systematically killing .
we were <unk> and <unk> execution , <unk> death , on our conscience .
and I thought about that .
what would I feel if I &apos;d been looking at the German <unk> all day ?
I couldn &apos;t believe .
that &apos;s a ridiculous thing .
but in our country , in the South , we were really killing -- when you were a white person , not a black person , when you were a death sentence , you were 10 times more likely to be a black person than a white person , not a white death penalty likely to be executed - - during those states , 100,000 people were killed .
but we haven &apos;t heard yet .
I believe this suggests that we have a camp .
and when we &apos;re really good at these issues , we &apos;re still good at things that are good for all of us .
we love innovation .
we love technology , we love to create .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , all of these good things were suffering , suffering , suffering , <unk> human rights , and <unk> .
for me , it &apos;s necessary for both of them .
because ultimately , we want to talk about how we want to be more secure , we want to be able to deal with the challenges that live in this complex society .
and for me , it takes time to think about the poor and to talk about the poor , who are the ones who never would ever come to TED .
but they &apos;re thinking that they &apos;re actually sort of <unk> them into our lives .
you know , ultimately , we have to believe in what we don &apos;t see .
we have to . we have to be smart , smart .
innovation , building development , not just in our mind .
these are the products of our brains , combined with our beliefs .
and this is a group of people that I believe will inspire us , not just for the light , but for the sake of the dark and the <unk> of the shadows .
it &apos;s a brilliant leader , <unk> <unk> .
he said , &quot; When we solve problems in Eastern Europe , we want to do a lot of things , but most importantly , we want to have a tendency to have a sense of soul and a willingness to feel despair . &quot;
and the point of the mind is that my core beliefs , our TED society , we need to participate .
there &apos;s nothing to do , to bridge the gap between technology and the perfect design and the human nature , as long as we can yet see it , to reach out to the poor , to the poor , to the <unk> , to the table .
and I want to remind you that this was a very challenging position than people who hadn &apos;t paid attention to .
it affects you .
when I was a young lawyer , I was lucky enough to meet the lady .
Mrs. Alisch would go to school , and every time she would meet two good friends , <unk> <unk> <unk> , she was a bus driver of the <unk> -- a very brilliant black woman -- and a black woman named Virginia <unk> , a white woman named Martin .
these women get together and talk about issues .
and sometimes the <unk> would call me up and say , &quot; Mrs. Penn . we &apos;re going to do it .
would you like to hear us ? &quot;
and I would say , &quot; Yes , ma &apos;am , I would love that . &quot;
and she said , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
and I would say , &quot; I want to hear that . &quot;
and then I used to listening .
these parties were very excited and inspiring .
and one time I was listening to them , and the lady asked me a few hours later , &quot; Brian and I talked to you about the equality initiative .
tell me what you &apos;re going to do . &quot;
and I started <unk> .
and I said , &quot; We want to challenge inequality .
we wanted to help people who were convicted of <unk> .
we want to fight against prejudice and discrimination in institutional institutions .
they gave them a life @-@ saving system to end .
we wanted to do something about the death penalty system .
we want to reduce the population .
we also want to keep the <unk> of our <unk> . &quot;
I made a four @-@ <unk> presentation , and when I finished , she looked at me and she said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; These things make you tired , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
and the <unk> came along , and she put her hand in my hand and she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;re brave . &quot;
I &apos;m sure the TED community needs to be more competent .
we need to find our way to confront these challenges , these suffering .
because ultimately , our whole humanity depends on everybody &apos;s humanity .
in my work .
I learned a very simple principle .
and I began to understand that each of us would not be defined by our worst .
I believe , for everyone on this planet .
if he lied , he was a liar .
if he didn &apos;t belong to what he was , he was a <unk> .
and even if you &apos;ve killed anyone , it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a killer .
because I believe that human beings have fundamental dignity , law has to respect it .
I also believe that in many parts of our country , of course , even the opposite of the poorest of the world , is not wealth .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I think the opposite of poverty in many , many places , is justice .
and finally , I believe that although it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , it &apos;s a lot of <unk> , it &apos;s not going to be looked at by technology , it &apos;s not going to be measured , we &apos;re not going to be judged by wisdom and philosophy .
ultimately , people say that our society is not based on how we respond to the rich , how we are privileged , but based on how we treat the poor , the people who are being <unk> .
because that &apos;s where we really started to understand who we were .
I always wanted to get there . I wanted to get there .
I work a lot .
it &apos;s like everybody .
sometimes these ideas are too large , and they can &apos;t figure it out .
I used to justify those kids with a lot of money .
I went to see my <unk> , and I watched my research as adults .
and I started thinking , what was it about ?
a judge , how do you define a person as a different person ?
the judge says he &apos;s adults , but I only see one child .
and one night , I didn &apos;t think so much about it , and I was thinking , &quot; Oh my God , if the judge can write you another person , there &apos;s a magic judge . &quot;
by Brian , this judge has magic .
you can &apos;t afford it .
because I was too late to sleep , my mind wasn &apos;t clear that I started a bill .
I was a sophomore , and I was a black kid .
and I started doing his defense , and he said , &quot; <unk> : I &apos;m going to take my 14 @-@ year @-@ olds and turn them into a little white <unk> . &quot;
in this initiative , I would say the <unk> , the police station , the court .
there was no <unk> court , no <unk> , no <unk> whatsoever , on purpose .
the next morning I woke up and I thought , did I do a dream , or did I really write this proposal ?
and the fear is , not only did I send me to the court .
and after a couple of months , I forgot that .
and I decided , oh my gosh , I had to do this .
I jumped in and felt nervous -- very nervous .
I went to court .
I &apos;m thinking , it &apos;s going to be a game @-@ changer .
and I finally got to the court .
and when I got on the stairs , there was a black <unk> , the courts .
and he saw me running , and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; I &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; and he said , &quot; You , you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
and this <unk> came to me as a hug .
and he whispered it to my ear .
he said , &quot; I &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
and I have to admit to you , this is something that I can &apos;t do .
and he reminded me that I was deep in my self @-@ consciousness that I was reminded that everybody should contribute to society , on a better way .
so I went to court .
I walked in , and the judge saw me .
&quot; Mr. Dickens , is you writing this ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; Mr. , that &apos;s what I wrote . &quot; we started arguing .
people came in , because they were all upset .
I did write a lot of stuff .
the police came in , and the prosecution came in .
and I hadn &apos;t come back , and the whole court room was full of anger , because we &apos;re talking about race , we &apos;re talking about poverty .
and I was walking around the corner of the shed .
and he kept <unk> , and he was able to hear people complain .
and he walked like this .
in the end , the black minister comes in and they &apos;re worried about sitting behind me and almost immediately after that .
ten minutes later , the judge offered a rest .
during the break , a <unk> cleaner felt that they were in the court .
this is a <unk> jump , and this is a <unk> .
&quot; Jimmy , what are you going to the court ? &quot;
this old black guy stood up and looked at this <unk> , and he said , &quot; I come in and I want to tell this young man to go ahead and see it better . &quot;
I &apos;ve come to TED today because I believe a lot of people here understand the moral <unk> of the world , although it &apos;s long , it &apos;s sideways .
before we start caring about human rights and dignity , we can &apos;t really accomplish evolution .
our survival and our everybody &apos;s survival has nothing to do with it .
our vision of technology and design has to do with the vision of entertainment and creativity , with the vision , with philanthropy .
and most of all , I just want to tell you , go ahead and see it better .
thank you .
you have to hear the audience , the community wants to help you , the willingness to make a difference .
what can we do with this check ?
Brian : there are many opportunities .
for example , if you live in California this spring , there &apos;s a poll that will be a huge market for all of our money to do it .
for example , in California , we &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars in the next five years -- 100 million .
and at the same time , forty @-@ six percent of our homicide fell into account .
fifty @-@ six percent <unk> , <unk> .
this was an opportunity to change .
and this was a poll that gave the money spent on law enforcement and security guards .
and I think that &apos;s an opportunity we can help .
in the last three decades , there &apos;s a drop in crime .
and some people say that part of the reason for this is because of a tremendous rise of incarceration .
what would you like to say that ?
Brian actually did not change anything .
the rate of incarceration in this country is not in a form of violence .
it &apos;s the abuse of drugs .
that &apos;s the main reason why our prison population is rising .
we were too far off <unk> .
at the same time , we had three <unk> , and we had the tools to lock someone up forever , just because we stole a bicycle , or we didn &apos;t give them a shot of the victim .
I believe we need to give more people to crimes than to deprive them .
I think the current day @-@ to @-@ day philosophy is not for anybody .
and I think that &apos;s something that should change .
Brian , you &apos;re ready to give you one .
you &apos;re really excited by this guy .
thank you very much for coming to TED . thank you .
<unk> : after Bin Laden was killed , there was a lot of danger .
form 2 : Somalia famine . <unk> 3 : police use pepper spray .
forty @-@ four : four bridges . <unk> Channel Five : <unk> .
<unk> 6 : <unk> . <unk> 7 : 65 .
<unk> <unk> : the tsunami . <unk> 9 : cyberattacks .
the second section of the drug war , the massive destruction , the hurricane , the hurricane .
there was a recession , a recession , a crisis , an Egyptian , Syria .
crisis , death , disasters .
Oh my God !
Peter <unk> : this is some video I &apos;ve collected in the last six months , if it &apos;s six days , or perhaps in the last six years .
the point is that news media tend to teach us negative information , because our brains are very easy to care about this .
and of course , the brain does this very important reason .
and all the time , our sensors &quot; collect a lot of information , so that our brains don &apos;t do it .
and none of this information is even more important than living , and the first line of all information is a very primitive part of the temporal map of the temporal lobes .
the brain <unk> is our early warnings , our peril .
it <unk> all of the information and examine it , any threat in the environment .
so whenever we open the newspaper , we automatically read the negative information .
the old one said about the newspaper : &quot; the <unk> headline , &quot; which was a very good idea .
and now we have all kinds of digital devices , all the way around to us , all the time , all the way around . no wonder .
no wonder people think the world is backwards .
but it may be true .
not so , the information that we receive was <unk> .
our society is making a huge improvement in what has happened in the centuries .
and I don &apos;t mean that these problems don &apos;t exist -- climate crisis , species disappearing , water and energy shortage .
as humans , we &apos;re very good at making predictions about the crisis , but we end up <unk> them .
let &apos;s look at what happened in the last century , to see where we &apos;re going .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has increased by two times , inflation has adjusted , income per person in the world has tripled .
the child mortality goes down 10 times .
food , electricity , transportation , communication costs reduced by 10 to 1,000 times less .
Steve <unk> pointed out that we are living in the most peaceful period of human history .
and Charles <unk> said that the world &apos;s penis went up from 25 to 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a great age .
and a lot of people forget that .
we kept pushing our expectations around .
in fact , we changed the concept of poverty .
if you think about it , most of the people in the United States today in poverty still have electricity , drinking water , toilets , telephone calls , air conditioning and cars .
the richest <unk> <unk> of the century , the <unk> <unk> on this planet , will never be imagined .
and the basis of all this is technology , and the technology of the recent exponential growth .
my good friend Ray Van <unk> showed that any information technology has doubled , and that is Moore &apos;s Law , 12 to 24 months @-@ hour price performance .
and that &apos;s why your mobile phone calls are 10,000 times cheaper than a 1960 computer in the 1970s .
look at this curve .
this is Moore &apos;s Law from the last hundred years .
I want you to notice two things about this curve .
first of all , it &apos;s very smooth -- whether it &apos;s good or bad , whether it &apos;s war or peace , recession or growth .
and that &apos;s because the faster computers are used to create ever faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow down because of the enormous challenges we face .
even on the left @-@ hand side , it &apos;s still a curve upward .
technology accelerated pace itself .
on this Moore &apos;s Law curve , it &apos;s a set of technologies that are open to everybody .
cloud computing , a friend of mine at Autodesk called an infinite amount of computing ; sensors and networks ; 3D printing , allows us to get the capacity of mass @-@ produced and personalized manufacturing worldwide ; a new generation of fuels , vaccine and food , synthetic medicine , synthetic medicine .
how many people in the audience saw the IBM James Watson &apos;s victory when the computer failed ?
that &apos;s great .
I looked at newspaper headlines , and I found the best way .
and I like this : &quot; Watson <unk> the human race . &quot;
it &apos;s not an easy game .
the key thing is to understand the subtle detail of the human language .
you can imagine the kind of artificial intelligence where all the people who have the action calls can be used .
four years ago at TED , Ray <unk> and I founded a new university called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
we teach students all sorts of technologies , especially how to use these technologies to address the enormous challenges of humankind .
every year we ask students to create a company or make a product or provide a service to create a meaningful impact on a billion people &apos;s lives .
imagine a group of students could affect a billion people &apos;s lives today .
that sounds ridiculous , 30 years ago .
today we can list the companies that make this happen .
when I think about creating a rich society , it &apos;s not about creating a luxury for everybody on the planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
it was a way of getting resources out there .
technology is relative , and technology is an instrument of liberation .
let me give you an example .
this is a story of Napoleon &apos;s fish in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the one on the left .
they invited them all to dinner .
all the soldiers in Napoleon were using gold plates .
but the king of Thailand uses aluminum <unk> .
aluminum used to be the most precious metal in the world , much more expensive than gold and <unk> .
that &apos;s why the top of the aluminum foil is aluminum .
the aluminum foil represents the shadow of the earth , but it &apos;s not a form of metal .
it &apos;s a combination of oxygen and oxygen .
but then the technology came along and made the shipping price so low that we could see it as one @-@ time <unk> .
let &apos;s apply that to other things .
let &apos;s think about energy shortage .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that contains about 5,000 pounds of energy per year .
each of those 16 minutes has 16 kilowatt @-@ hours of energy on the surface of the Earth .
the problem is not just power . it &apos;s accessible .
there &apos;s a couple of good news .
this year , for the first time in India , the cost of solar energy reduced to half the cost of fossil fuels -- <unk> , 17 rupees .
the cost of solar power in the last year has halved .
and last month , MIT announced a research report showing that by 2020 , the cost of solar power is between six and six cents per kilowatt @-@ hour , and the average standard is 15 cents .
if we have enough energy , we have plenty of water .
let &apos;s go into the wars .
remember , 1990 , the <unk> of the <unk> going through Saturn , facing its direction .
took a famous photo , what was the name ?
&quot; dot com . &quot;
because we live on a planet .
70 percent of the Earth &apos;s surface is covered with water .
yes , two percent of the water that we have in the ocean is the iceberg , and we &apos;re fighting over the world , and we still have hope .
there &apos;s a technology that &apos;s being committed to application , not the next 10 years , but now .
there &apos;s a nano @-@ technology .
I talked to you this morning with a great DIY fellow Dean Kamen , and I want to share with you -- and I got him -- who &apos;s allowed to develop technology called <unk> -- some of you may have heard about it as a small refrigerator .
you can grow 1,000 liters of water from any stream of water -- water , pollution , water , water , water , water @-@ making -- a thousand @-@ liter liquid drinking water .
the president of Coke &apos;s recent meeting is <unk> in many developing countries , and they have a large test .
if it &apos;s successful , I &apos;m confident that Coke will be deployed , and Coke will be deployed around the world to do it .
and that &apos;s the innovation that &apos;s being driven by technology .
we see this on the mobile phone .
my gosh , at the end of 2013 , the mobile phone in the developing world will be 70 percent .
think about it . one of the <unk> in the middle of Kenya has better motion than Reagan &apos;s about 25 years ago .
if they visit Google with their smartphone , they get more knowledge and information about 15 years ago than the President of Bill Clinton .
they live in a world of information and communications , and this has not been predicted in the past .
and better yet , we &apos;ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars -- GPS , TV and <unk> , and medical diagnostic technology -- not pharmaceutical companies getting involved in your mobile phone .
perhaps the best part of this is probably medicine .
I had the privilege of meeting this last month with the <unk> Foundation to get 1,000 million dollars in mobile hands .
we challenged our team around the world to combine these technologies into mobile devices , and you can talk to it , because it has artificial intelligence , and it has <unk> , or <unk> .
to win the competition , this device needs to give you a better diagnostic than a group of physicians who have been approved .
imagine a facility where a hundred percent of the disease burden of just 1.3 percent of the medical researchers .
and if this device was able to sequence the RNA of the virus or DNA , it would actually call the control center , the first time it would prevent a pandemic .
we also have the power to create the most rich world .
I call it the One billion people .
that white line is the population .
more than seven billion people on Earth today .
and by the way , the best way to prevent the explosion of population growth is to get more education around the world .
in 2010 , we had about two billion people connected to the Internet .
by 2020 , the Internet will grow from two billion to five billion .
three billion people never would have noticed , will be involved in this conversation .
what do they want ?
what would they consume ? what would their wish be ?
what we &apos;re going to see is the largest , energy @-@ saving , not a recession .
these are the people who represent hundreds of millions of dollars , and they &apos;re going to put into a global economy .
they &apos;re going to get better , because they &apos;re going to get better , they &apos;re going to get better , and they &apos;re going to get more productive than they &apos;ve ever had in the past .
three billion dollars of health , education , productive people in our society could bring us ?
a series of <unk> that we never had before .
and people who are <unk> , or other difficult , have the opportunity to pay attention and help .
what does that leave us with ?
maybe it &apos;s something we haven &apos;t seen yet .
and one of the things that I &apos;ve learned in the course of winning X @-@ ray is the importance of goals , the passionate team that can accomplish extraordinary things in the past .
let me share with you a story as a end , and the story is very exciting .
some of you may have heard about this project .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it came from the University of Washington in Seattle .
it &apos;s an individual that can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the proteins are folding .
and the way it folds is the structure and function of the amino acids .
this is a very important medical study .
until now , this is a problem solved by super @-@ computer .
this was a game that was originally called professors .
and then hundreds of people went online and started playing this game .
it also shows that the pattern of human recognition is still better than the best computer .
when you synthesize the best folding experts , it &apos;s not a professor at MIT , it &apos;s not a student at Caltech , it &apos;s a British woman from Manchester University , who came to work during a healing treatment during the day , but also the best proteins in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what has given me a huge faith in the future , is that each of us has been challenged to challenge the challenges of the world .
we have technology and tools to grow fast .
it &apos;s a passion for the DIY inventors .
everybody has the power to be a technological , philanthropists .
at the same time , there &apos;s 30 million people coming to the line , working with us on a huge challenge , doing what we have to do .
we &apos;re on the verge of a decade or two .
thank you .
I think there &apos;s a cultural role in medicine today that I think has to start changing .
and this change can start with a doctor , which is me .
maybe it &apos;s because I &apos;ve been in medicine for many years , and I can take on some of these things and start changing them .
let &apos;s start by talking about baseball .
why not ?
and the routine was over , and the world &apos;s professions are about to start .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
there are hundreds of thousands of deaf people in the world .
let &apos;s look at the data .
the movie &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is about data , and how to build a great team based on the data .
I want to talk about a data that I want you to hear about .
it &apos;s called a bat .
when we say a ball hits , it &apos;s when we talk about a bat .
we mean the players &apos; fight was very stable , and each 10 times you get three <unk> .
and the <unk> meant that the <unk> was hit and put into the tent , and it wasn &apos;t going to be killed immediately , and the ball wasn &apos;t going to be successful until the <unk> arrived .
three out of 10 are <unk> .
do you know what the baseball <unk> do and what they do ?
great , great , stars .
you know how they called a bat for a ball .
that &apos;s the four players who hit each 10 .
it &apos;s a legacy -- like Ted Williams -- who &apos;s the great baseball team in baseball -- and the last player in <unk> has more than four chapters in the <unk> .
now let &apos;s go back to my world -- medical field , which I &apos;m familiar with , but what I &apos;m going to talk about is something that bothers me .
if you had a <unk> , and you were recommend that you had a four @-@ pound surgeon in a <unk> surgery .
it sounds strange , right ?
and if you live in a very remote area , and the two coronary artery that you love is blocked . you recommended her <unk> to a specialized unit in which a blood vessel forming has a <unk> measure .
but wait , wait , you know what ?
she had a big increase in her performance this year , and her level was recovered .
her &quot; hit the ball . &quot;
but it &apos;s not acceptable .
and I want to ask you a question .
what do you think , a medical doctor , a career doctor , a professional nursing doctor or an emergency surgeon ?
<unk> ? very good .
in fact , no one in the medical community knows what a good surgeon or an emergency manager should have .
we tell each of them , including myself , when I come to a professional class , they tell themselves to be perfect .
absolutely , there &apos;s no way to make false diagnosis -- but we make them think about detail , about how to do that .
that &apos;s what I got when I went to medical school .
I &apos;m a student who has become self @-@ reliant .
at school , a student once said that Brian <unk> will review it as a blood test .
and I did .
I was out in a van outside Toronto , and I was in a small <unk> in my house , and finished my studies .
I had everything .
and I got to the point where every piece of muscle that I mentioned in the <unk> and the way that you stretch out , each branch of the aorta , and all of the unseen , and the usual suspects .
I even knew how to judge different <unk> .
during that time , I was accumulating more knowledge .
I did a good job , and I graduated from <unk> .
when I got out of medical school , I felt like I had to just guess all the things I knew -- or take a step closer -- almost everything I &apos;d made out of medical errors very , very little .
and I didn &apos;t make any mistakes in a matter of time , until I met seven women .
when Ms. <unk> was brought into a teaching hospital in Toronto , I was working as an emergency room .
I was appointed as a cardiac cardiac wireless clinic .
my job was that when the emergency staff had to have a full @-@ spectrum of people who were looking at the heart , they were being diagnosed with <unk> .
and I was responsible for my reporting back then .
and when I met a woman named <unk> , her breath was pretty faint .
I heard her breath when I spoke to her .
and when I heard her in the stethoscope , on both sides of the boat came to me , this is <unk> heart failure .
that &apos;s because of the heart failure , you can &apos;t get all the blood intact , and that part of the blood goes into the lung , it &apos;s filled with blood , it &apos;s breathing .
it &apos;s not a difficult diagnostic .
and then I started working with her .
I gave her the toaster aspirin , and gave her medicine some medicine that would <unk> her heart .
and I gave her some <unk> , <unk> , to help her to take the extra water out .
in the next two or three hours , she started getting better .
and I was happy .
and at this point I made the first mistake : I brought her home .
and I made two mistakes .
and I was reporting back to her home before my family and my family members .
I didn &apos;t do what I was supposed to do , pick up the phone call and give him a look at this example , give him an opportunity to meet his patient .
my family knew her , so I could give her more detailed data .
maybe there &apos;s a reason for that .
maybe I don &apos;t want to be the kind of rules that require always .
maybe a patient can communicate with me without having to communicate with my patient .
the second error I made was even more serious .
and when I got her home , I ignored a little voice in my heart , and the voice tried to tell me , &quot; Don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , I was so confident that I didn &apos;t have any sense at the time that I even looked at the nurses of the woman who said , &quot; Do you think she &apos;s home ? &quot;
the nurse thought , and the nurse said , &quot; Hmm , I don &apos;t think so . &quot;
all of this , for me , also happened yesterday .
I signed up for the hospital , an ambulance company sent her home .
and I went back to work in my clinic .
and on the next day , that afternoon , my gut had a sense of <unk> .
but I kept working .
and at the end of my work , I left the hospital , and as I walked into the parking lot , I did something that I didn &apos;t normally do .
I borrowed from the emergency room .
and there was another nurse , not the other woman who took care of a woman , who told me that most of them were afraid to hear three words .
the other two doctors were also frightened of the three words , but because of the fact that patients who looked at each other had a specific meaning , they had a lot of sense .
these three words : remember ?
&quot; remember that guy you sent home ? &quot;
the nurse asked .
&quot; she comes back . &quot; she used that regular tone .
she did come back .
and it &apos;s been very sudden death .
and after I got her home about an hour later , she was on the ground , her family hit 9 / 11 , the emergency woman brought her back to the emergency room , and at this point she had severe shock , blood pressure .
her breathing was extremely mild , <unk> .
and the crowd was shocked .
they gave her increased blood pressure .
and she connected her <unk> .
I was shocked , and I was terrified .
and then I was like doing a <unk> reaction , because when they <unk> her situation , she would send her in a <unk> ward , and I would wake up in despair .
but in the next two or three days , she never woke up again .
her brain had been torn apart .
her family came together .
and in the course of the next session , they slowly accepted it .
at the end of the season , they chose her to leave the person -- the lady , the wife and the grandmother .
some people say you never forget the names of the dead people that you &apos;ve died .
and that was the first time I realized that .
in the next couple of weeks , I was incredibly depressed , and for the first time , I had this incredible sense of dangers in the medical culture -- I felt lonely . it wasn &apos;t a feeling of being healthy , because you couldn &apos;t talk about it .
it &apos;s that , when you <unk> your commitment to your best friends , to say that you should be conservative , and you know that , after you know , your best friends look at you , even though you &apos;re having a fight , but that feeling is still dominant , and I will tell you , I won &apos;t be the same problem .
and all of that , you do the right promise , and then you will never do that .
it &apos;s a sense of shame .
and the kind of non @-@ toxic shame that I &apos;m talking about makes you feel fat .
it would tell you , it &apos;s not your fault ; it &apos;s your bad guys .
that was my feeling .
and that &apos;s not because of my <unk> ; others are pretty good .
he talked to that family , and I &apos;m sure he didn &apos;t hit me by the law .
but I kept asking myself questions .
why didn &apos;t I touch my <unk> ? why did I get her home ?
and even more frustrating , I would ask : why do I commit such dumb errors ?
why would I choose access to medicine ?
slowly but slowly and steady , it began to <unk> .
I started to feel <unk> .
and then in a sunny day , when I saw a flash of light in the sun , I thought , maybe I can feel better again .
and then I did an appointment with myself : if I could do perfect , I could not make mistakes , and I would let that go .
that voice did stop .
I went back to work .
but it happened .
two years later , when I was in a hospital in Northern Toronto , I saw a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man on my throat .
and the clinic was busy , so I was getting started .
and he kept on pointed here .
and I looked at his throat a little bit of <unk> .
I left him with a prescription for penicillin .
even when he stepped out of the gate of the clinic , he seemed to be pointing at his throat .
two days later , I was on the emergency room , and my director was going to go and talk about her in private .
she said those three words : remember ?
&quot; remember that one of the people you saw in your throat ? &quot;
he didn &apos;t have the <unk> .
it &apos;s a condition that might be threatened to live , called <unk> .
you can look at Google , but it &apos;s not the throat , it &apos;s the <unk> infection , and it could cause respiratory failure .
luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
and after a couple of days of <unk> , he was cured .
and I went back to that moment of guilt and regret , and then I took a step back to work , and then went back to work , and then it happened again .
I didn &apos;t see any patients on the same page .
it &apos;s very difficult to imagine what happens , especially when you work in a hospital where you have hospitals at night .
I didn &apos;t even get them home , and I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the process of taking care of .
one of them I diagnosed is <unk> .
he set up kidney x @-@ ray , but it turned out to be normal . my colleagues were <unk> on the patient &apos;s condition , and he noticed that the patient &apos;s right @-@ hand parts had a soft association with the surgeons .
another patient has severe diarrhea .
I gave him some liquid to help him replace the water , and brought it back to my colleagues .
he did it . and when he noticed that the patient &apos;s right @-@ hand , he connected the surgeons .
both of these patients did surgery and recovered .
but when I think about those two cases , it hurts me .
and I also hope that I can tell you that the worst mistake I &apos;ve ever made is only five years ago when I started practicing medicine , like many of my colleagues described it , but it &apos;s completely <unk> .
in the last five years , I &apos;ve made some mistakes .
I still felt lonely , humiliated .
but the crux of the problem is , if I can &apos;t explain and talk about the wrong things that I &apos;ve made , if I can &apos;t find the answer to that question , how can I share my experiences with my colleagues ?
how do I teach them not to repeat my mistakes ?
and when I got to a place -- like now , I don &apos;t know how you think about me .
when did you hear somebody talk about their failure once and time again ?
yes , if you go to a party , you might hear something about other doctors &apos;s mistakes , but you don &apos;t hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
if I walked into a room of my colleagues right now , looking for help and starting to tell them what I told you about , maybe even before I even told them about two stories , they were starting to get very uncomfortable . somebody had a joke , and then they would change the topic .
in fact , if I were , or my colleagues , I knew that one of the senior staff in the hospital was able to help patients with their legs , and believe me , when I met him , I couldn &apos;t mix them with normal eyes .
this is the system that we have .
a system that is completely <unk> .
there are only two people in this system -- mistakes of being wrong , can suffer from sleep loss and inadequate , and the results of those terrible outcomes .
it &apos;s almost like the self @-@ organizing response of a immune system , like the antibodies normally start attacking that different person .
we have an idea that when we take all the mistakes we make , we get a safe system .
but that idea raises two questions .
in my first paper on <unk> radio and news , from my first article in Toronto , I wrote in &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and I found myself studying everything I could relate to and mistakes I could deal with .
and what I &apos;ve learned is that mistakes are everywhere .
we work in a system where every day we have errors , and hospitals have a 10 percent chance of getting a dose to a <unk> or giving a wrong dose of errors , and in hospitals , the cases where they get infected , rather than dying .
in this country , nearly 20,000 Canadian children died from preventable medical mistakes .
in the United States , according to the Institute of Medicine , there were 10 million people .
and even so , both of these pieces have vastly underestimated the reality , because we &apos;ve never looked at the problem as we should .
the point is that .
in a healthcare system , in two or three years of the year @-@ olds , we can &apos;t measure the growth of that knowledge .
sleep deprivation is a very common situation .
and we couldn &apos;t get away from that .
our own intuition biases our own intuition , our own conclusions , like , that I can record perfectly for a patient with a patient .
but if the same patient with a naked eye , with a little bit of <unk> , I would write down a bit of <unk> .
and that &apos;s a completely different record .
I &apos;m not a robot . I don &apos;t do the same thing every time .
my patients aren &apos;t cars , they &apos;re not going to describe their symptoms every time .
so mistakes are inevitable .
if I were to teach the system that I was able to identify all the patients that went wrong , then there wouldn &apos;t be anyone left behind .
and it &apos;s about the worst mistakes people don &apos;t want to talk about .
in my show , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which I &apos;ve said , &quot; That &apos;s my worst mistake . &quot; and I would say to anyone who has gone from emergency emergency school to heart @-@ to @-@ heart doctors , &quot; This is my worst mistake , and I will hand them , &quot; Why don &apos;t you ? &quot;
their pupils dilate , they <unk> , and then they look at the floor , <unk> and start telling me their stories .
they want to tell their stories , and they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; Listen , <unk> is the same as I am . &quot;
they just need a moment to tell .
what they need is a re @-@ defined medical culture .
start with a specific doctor .
the doctors who define it as humans , understand that she &apos;s man , and accept it , and she doesn &apos;t seem to be glorious , but can learn from it and learn from it .
she will share her experience with others .
and they were backed by people talking about their sin .
she doesn &apos;t have a sense of <unk> , but it &apos;s only a way to get everyone out of this , a way of figuring out what other people are wrong .
and the medical culture of her work acknowledged that the whole system was run by people , and when someone was running a system , sometimes it wasn &apos;t a problem .
and the system can evolve over and over and over again , to make it easier for us to detect things that we can &apos;t avoid , and at the same time , we can grow a job of caring for a person who speaks to our health care system , particularly encouragement of time .
I &apos;m Brian <unk> .
I &apos;m a physician who <unk> .
I &apos;m a human , and I make mistakes .
I was sorry for that , but I would try to learn from it and learn from others .
I still don &apos;t know how you think about me , but I think I can .
so let me end up with three words of myself : I remember .
in the 1980s , if you had a typewriter , you had to sign up to the government .
you had to be registered by that phrase .
and in this case , the government is tracking where the text comes from .
if they found a single page on the wrong point , they could track who generated that idea .
and in the West , we can &apos;t understand how someone can do this , how freedom of speech can be .
we will never do that in our own country .
but today , 2011 , if you buy a page from any of the biggest <unk> site , print out a page , and then you end up having a little bit of paper on every page of the page that makes it unique to you and your printer .
this is what happens to us today .
no one seemed to be doing it .
this is an example of how our government uses technology to deal with our citizens .
this is one of the three major sources of the Internet .
if we look at what is happening online , we identify with the attacker of the world .
we have three major groups .
we have online criminals .
and here we have Mr. <unk> from Ukraine .
online criminals are easy to understand .
these guys were making money .
they make a lot of money online attacks , lots of money .
we actually had several cases of <unk> , <unk> , all made by <unk> attacks .
there &apos;s <unk> from Estonia .
this is Alfred Hitchcock .
this is Stephen <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> .
this is Matthew Anderson , a brass pen , etc .
these people were making a lot of money online , but they were making illegal money , using similar banking services -- from our accounts , when we were on the Internet , or from <unk> , to gather our credit card information when we were infected with an infected computer .
the United States , two months ago , froze Mr. <unk> &apos;s bank accounts at the Swiss bank account , and there were <unk> million dollars in the frozen pit .
Mr. <unk> himself remained alone ; nobody knew where he was .
today , I would argue that any of us in this room could be a victim of online crime , a victim of the world .
and it &apos;s obviously getting worse .
in the future , most crime will happen online .
the second group of attacks that we &apos;ve seen today are not due to money .
their motivation came from somewhere else -- from protest , from <unk> , from being ridiculed .
these anonymous groups were actively active in the last 12 months , and they became the key participants in the online attack .
these are the three main <unk> of the world : for the crimes , the anonymous attacks , the international gangs , the government attacks .
let &apos;s take a look at what happens to companies like <unk> .
this is a typical example of government attacking it .
<unk> was a authority in the Netherlands , or it was .
it was broke last fall because they were hacked .
some people completely destroyed it .
I asked a meeting in the last week in a meeting with the minister of the meeting , and I asked a leader whether or not someone could have died from an attack .
his answer was yes .
so , how do people die for such an attack ?
<unk> is an authority certificate .
they sell certificate .
what do you do with your certificate ?
you need a certificate , which is that you have a website that has four million tons of secret services , similar services .
now all of us , or most of us , use <unk> or any of its competitors , are services that are particularly popular in the state of Iran , Iran @-@ state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art services , because they know that these are more reliable than local services , so they can &apos;t discuss their discussion .
they could also , if they attacked a foreign authority .
<unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of <unk> .
what happens in the Arab region , like in Egypt ?
in Egypt , the riots had <unk> the headquarters for the Egyptian government , in April of 2011 , they found a lot of documents .
in these documents , there was a sign called <unk> .
there are some notes from a German company that sells tools for the Egyptian government to take the -- a lot of the country &apos;s communication .
they sold it to the Egyptian government for their 28 Euros .
the headquarters for the company are right there .
so the Western government is bringing power to governments to fight their own citizens .
but the Western government also did it for themselves .
for example , in Germany , it was discovered a few weeks ago by the German government of Germany called the German government of Germany to investigate their own citizens .
if you &apos;re a <unk> to vote , it &apos;s clear that your eye has been hacked .
but today , things have gone .
they will watch your Internet .
they &apos;re going to be able to use tools like <unk> to infect your computer so that they can monitor all of your communications , listen to your online discussion , gather your password .
and when we think about these things , it &apos;s obvious that the reaction is , &quot; Yeah , it sounds bad , but because I &apos;m a legitimate citizen , I don &apos;t really have a effect on me .
why should I worry ?
I didn &apos;t hide . &quot;
that &apos;s where the argument is , there &apos;s no reason .
privacy is <unk> .
privacy doesn &apos;t have to talk .
it &apos;s not a privacy @-@ against @-@ security issue .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against policing .
we will trust our government in 2011 , and we will lose it forever .
will we trust the future government , blindly trusting , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old government ?
these are the questions we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
it may sound a little bit strange . I &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
the first stone axe was invented in <unk> by a very simple idea of putting cement into a fixed @-@ scale bricks .
and soon it became the most dominant building in the world .
it allows us to build things that are more than self @-@ reliant , buildings , bridges , and that way .
the actual Lego blocks have become essentially the Lego blocks of our age .
and in about 100 years , in 1947 , the Lego brought in .
it was called the Self @-@ Assembly .
and within just a few years , the Lego community occupied every family .
it &apos;s been estimated that the Lego blocks have made more than four billion dollars -- or 75 dollars per person on the planet .
you don &apos;t need to be an engineer , you can build beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
the Lego is possible .
the Lego essentially is to take the Lego blocks , the Lego in the real world , to the building blocks that we imagine .
in the same year , in <unk> , a new revolution is going to launch , next @-@ generation building blocks .
transistors are a little plastic component that will take us from a static building to a new world where everything can interact .
you can use it as a transistor transistors , and you can create larger , more complicated circuits .
but there &apos;s a major difference : only experts can play transistors .
I personally couldn &apos;t believe that the Lego blocks of our generation were the only experts in play , so I decided to change it .
eight years ago , when I was at the Media Lab , I started thinking about how I could empower the engineers and the designers .
I started developing <unk> a few years ago .
I &apos;ll show you how it works .
the camera is a module that has a specific function in every single piece .
they were pre @-@ programmed for lighting , motors , sensors .
and best of all , they &apos;re magnets , they &apos;re mixed together .
so it &apos;s impossible to assemble .
the bits are separated by color .
green is output , blue is power , and pink is input , and the orange one is the <unk> .
so what you need to do is take the blue , and immediately you can start making bigger circuits .
you take the blue and you get a green light .
you can put a dial in the middle and you can make a little <unk> .
and when you remove a pulse module , you create a little pattern here .
add the pressure to the point where you create a noise machine .
I had to go .
in addition to that , it &apos;s actually very robust , very powerful .
there &apos;s no programming , there &apos;s a <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> that allows you to program it with simple intuition .
so for example , if you &apos;re going to shine a little bit , you just have to turn the button and actually make it faster or slower .
the idea behind the scenes is that this is a database of growth .
we wanted to take every single one of the world &apos;s individual interactions and make them available everywhere .
light , solar panels , motors -- everything should be <unk> .
we used to teach our kids to play with them .
that was an incredible experience .
and the great thing about this is that they start to understand that the appliances that they have on their daily basis are <unk> .
for example , how <unk> work or why the <unk> can keep on , or how the iPod feels .
we also used to bring design schools .
for example , we had designers who had no experience at all , and we started playing with materials .
as you can see , it &apos;s created in <unk> and paper .
a few weeks ago , we went to Rhode Island School of Design to give it to designers who were completely out of engineering experience , cardboard , wood and paper -- and tell them , &quot; Do something . &quot;
this is a project they &apos;ve done , and it &apos;s a feedback loop on the feedback loop .
and so on , this is actually one of my favorites .
it &apos;s a lobster @-@ play ; it &apos;s a <unk> .
for those of you who are a tech researcher , electronic is a different kind of material , and electrons are a material .
and we wanted to make this material available for everybody .
so open source is open source .
you can go to the website , download all of the design files , make it yourself .
we want to encourage a world where people are the inventors , the inventors , the <unk> world , because the world we live in , the world of interaction , belongs to each of us .
don &apos;t panic , start your invention .
thank you .
when I was 11 years old , I remember one morning waking up , hearing pleasure in my family .
my father was listening to the BBC in his little radio .
and he didn &apos;t see it , because most of the news was letting him down .
&quot; the Taliban went ! &quot; the father was screaming .
I don &apos;t know what that means , but I can see the father is very happy .
&quot; you can now go to a real school . &quot; he said .
I &apos;ll never forget that morning .
a real school .
when I was six years old , the Taliban took over Afghanistan and said that girls were illegal .
so in the next five years , I went with my sister to a secret school where my sister was no longer allowed to go .
this is the only education we had .
we &apos;re going to walk every day so that no one will wonder where we are .
we put the books on the food chain so people think we &apos;re just shopping .
we had 100 people locked in a small living room .
it was very comfortable in the winter , but it was very hot .
we all know that we &apos;re at risk of life -- teachers , students , parents .
and sometimes the school is suspended from the Taliban to a week .
we always worry about being discovered by the Taliban .
are we tracking ?
do they know our place ?
we were terrified , but we still wanted to go to school .
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that valued and loved daughter .
my grandfather was a remarkable man in his age .
he was born into Afghanistan , and he had different ideas , and he insisted on making his daughter , my mother , to school , and therefore was forced to cut off from his father .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
that &apos;s her .
she retired two years ago , and she turned my house into a school , a girl and a woman in an education community .
my father -- that &apos;s him -- he &apos;s the first person in his family .
so there was no doubt that his child should be educated , including his daughter , who had the Taliban , had a risk .
for him , the child doesn &apos;t receive education is a greater risk .
in the Taliban , for the years of the Taliban , I remember that sometimes I was frustrated by my own life , I was afraid to see the future .
I thought I &apos;d give up , but my father would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you may lose anything in your life .
your money could be stolen , you could be <unk> by the war .
and the only thing that you can live with is that , if we have to pay the tuition , we &apos;re going to save the school .
do you even want to continue ? &quot;
now I &apos;m 22 .
the country I grew up surrounded by decades of war .
there were less than six percent of my women at high school , and if not my family , I would be like most people .
and I &apos;m now a proud college student .
one of the top songs of the United States is one of the great <unk> of the United States , and it was ranked in 2012 where I went back to Afghanistan when I went back to Afghanistan , and my grandfather was purchased by my daughter , and first to me <unk> .
he was proud of not only my university education , but also because in women , I was the first , in women , and I was the first person to drive him around the streets of Kabul .
my family was very confident .
my dreams were big , but they were more expecting me to be more .
that &apos;s why I became the president of Global <unk> , a global organization for women &apos;s education .
and that &apos;s why I got involved in a new initiative , the first , probably the only boarding in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , girls are still very dangerous .
what excites me is that I see students in my school can take chances and aspirations .
I saw their parents &apos; parents , and especially their fathers , like my father , who supported them , although they saw fear from their faces .
for example , he wasn &apos;t a real name , and I couldn &apos;t let you see his face , he was my father .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter , on the way back to his school village , killed the bombs .
he got to his house , and the phone rang , and the voice rang , and he said , if he got his daughter to school , it would happen again .
&quot; if you want to kill me now , &quot; he said , &quot; But I &apos;m not going to ruin my daughter &apos;s future for you . &quot;
and for Afghanistan , I realized -- and this is something that no longer has ever realized -- that behind our success , it &apos;s a father -- who can recognize the value of his daughter , the success of his daughter , the success of his own daughter .
it &apos;s not that mothers aren &apos;t important for our success .
in fact , for the future of daughter &apos;s daughter , they &apos;re often the first and most compelling <unk> , but in a society like Afghanistan , we have to have male support .
in the Taliban controlled , there were only a couple of hundred of girls -- please don &apos;t forget , that was illegal .
but today , girls in Afghanistan have over 300 million .
Afghanistan is very different from the United States .
and I realized that Americans can see the fragility of our change .
I was worried how long it would last for the U.S. military .
but when I went back to Afghanistan and saw my students and my them supportive and encouraged their parents , I saw hope for the future , and I saw that change .
for me , Afghanistan is full of hope and infinite possibilities , and girls who read them every single day are reminded of me .
like me , they have great dreams .
thank you .
everything I do , whether it &apos;s my whole life or work , my whole life -- was profoundly influenced by the impact of the seven years of working in Africa .
from 1971 , I looked very young , but I was actually -- I was in Zambia , Kenya , Algeria , Somalia , Somalia , developing a partnership with Africa .
I was working in an Italian non @-@ governmental organization , and every project we set up in Africa failed .
I was panic .
when I was 21 , I think we were Italian and we were doing good for Africa .
and yet , what are we doing ?
our first project gave me the inspiration of the first book , the title of &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; and in this case , we said , &quot; <unk> <unk> Project , &quot; which is the project .
so we took the seeds from Italy to the south , a spectacular valley to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the <unk> , to plants and <unk> and so on .
and of course , the local people were not interested in this , so we paid their paycheck to work , and they were coming for a moment .
we were thrilled about this .
but we didn &apos;t ask them why , and just the <unk> said , &quot; Gene <unk> us . &quot;
&quot; help out in the front lines of hunger in the dead people . &quot;
and of course , everything in Africa looks pretty good .
our own <unk> @-@ like tomato , which is very big in Italy , a single @-@ fiber plant . and in Zambia , that &apos;s so big .
it was incredible . we said to the organisms , &quot; Look , it &apos;s easier to farm . &quot;
and when the tomatoes were growing up , the <unk> looks pretty good , and all the <unk> from the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and we said , &quot; Oh my gosh , these damn <unk> ! &quot;
and Zambia said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we &apos;re not here . &quot;
&quot; why don &apos;t you ever say anything ? &quot; you haven &apos;t asked . &quot;
I thought we were only <unk> in Africa , but when I knew what Americans were , the British were , the French were doing what they did , I was very proud of our project in Zambia .
because we at least fed the <unk> .
you should look at the trash -- you should see how many trash we put in Africa .
you can read this book , &quot; <unk> aid , &quot; and it &apos;s a picture of Dan <unk> , an orthopedic surgeon .
this book was published in 2009 .
we &apos;ve put two trillion dollars into Africa in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to talk to you about the damage that money has made .
you read it yourself .
if you look at the perspective of a woman in Africa , you can see how much damage we have .
we are Western <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and there are only two ways that we deal with : one , two , three parents .
these two words come from a Latin word , &quot; meaning &quot; father . &quot;
but two words mean different .
parents love to say that I treat people in different cultures as my child . &quot;
and what <unk> meant was that I looked at other cultures as my servant .
that &apos;s why white people in Africa are called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is the boss .
when I read a book , I read a book called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and the author was &quot; <unk> , &quot; and he said , &quot; The most important thing about economic development is that if people don &apos;t want help , just follow them .
this should be the primary principles of aid .
the primary principle of aid is respect .
this morning , Mr. <unk> , put a stick on the floor of the conference , and said , &quot; Could we -- can you imagine a city that &apos;s not invaded ? &quot;
when I was 27 years old , I made a decision that was based on the need for people , and I started a work system called <unk> , and we didn &apos;t do the founder , we didn &apos;t motivate anyone , but the passion for local entrepreneurs to find better places .
so what we &apos;re going to do -- just shut up .
we walked into a community and we weren &apos;t allowed to treat each other , but we were sitting there with the locals .
our work wasn &apos;t in the office .
we met with our clients in restaurants and at bars .
we don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
what we do is we make friends with them , and we discover their interest and purpose .
the most important thing is passion .
you can ask your ideas to your clients .
but if they &apos;re not interested , what do you do ?
the passion for self @-@ improvement is the most important .
the passion for each other is to build on the basis of self @-@ improvement , which is the most important .
and then we help them collect the knowledge and the information , because it &apos;s the world , the <unk> , the <unk> .
people who have ideas don &apos;t necessarily know anything , but we can support them .
so many years ago , I had an idea that we couldn &apos;t do it at least once , not to attach our ideas to them , but that can &apos;t be done in the community meeting .
I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
the community meetings have a problem .
the entrepreneurs never went to show you , they would never tell you in the public sector , where they were going to spend it , what they were going to spend .
so there &apos;s a proposal for this .
you don &apos;t even have the smartest of those people in your community because they &apos;re not part of your public gathering .
what we did was , we had to build a social infrastructure for one @-@ to @-@ one .
we have to create a whole new career .
this is the equivalent of the corporate laboratory , the company <unk> , facing face @-@ to @-@ face with your household , your kitchen table , your dining room , your shop , your cafe , your window , and your entrepreneurial passion to transform your business into a living skill .
I did an experiment in <unk> , Iowa .
and I was in a Ph.D. , and I was trying to get away from that , and it was only going to be very difficult .
my first year at <unk> , just to take a walk out of the street , and in those days , I had the first client , and I helped this first person . he was a <unk> , and he was a garage , and I was able to sell the fish for him , and the local fishermen , they said , &quot; Can you come to me ? &quot;
and I had these five fishermen work , not to get a nice tuna to sell it at 60 cents per square inch , but to sell it to Japan at a high level , and then a farmer to tell me , &quot; Hey , can you help them ? &quot;
within a year , I did 27 projects , and the government ran to me and said , &quot; What do you do ?
how can you -- &quot; I said , &quot; I did something difficult .
that &apos;s <unk> , listen to them . &quot;
so -- So the government said , &quot; That &apos;s it . &quot;
we started this project in 300 communities around the world .
we have helped build 40,000 companies .
the next generation of entrepreneurs suffer from nothing .
Peter Gabriel , one of the greatest <unk> of all time , died a few years ago , and 96 .
Peter <unk> said before he went to business as a philosophy professor , Peter <unk> once said , &quot; The plan is essentially incompatible with entrepreneurship &apos;s economy . &quot;
the plan was to give entrepreneurship a lot of money .
now , we rebuild the <unk> , but we don &apos;t know what the most brilliant and innovative people want to do with their own lives .
we have to learn how to give these people their opinions .
we have to give them permission , and respect their privacy , and we have to be good at providing them so that they come to the door and they come to the table .
in a community of 100,000 people , we have 200 of them .
can you imagine a community of about 4,000 human beings , <unk> of all intelligence and passion ?
who &apos;s the biggest talk I &apos;ve ever given ?
it &apos;s an incredibly passionate local community . you applaud them .
so what I want to talk about is , pioneering spirit is the tendency of today .
when we were at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we were able to use <unk> fuel , manufacturing -- but we suddenly realized that this was sustainable .
the internal combustion engine would be one day .
it &apos;s not uncommon for <unk> .
what we &apos;re going to care about now is how we can meet the food , health , education , transportation , communications .
there &apos;s no technology at all .
who could invent this technology for a green revolution ? university ?
governments ? don &apos;t you ?
entrepreneurs are people who are struggling with it .
many years ago , I saw an interesting article in a magazine called <unk> .
there were a group of experts invited to talk about what the future of New York was .
that &apos;s when you think about it , when you think about it , you know , 100 years later , New York City has figured out its place .
why ? because they looked at the chart and said , if the population continues to grow at this rate , the people in New York will need six million horses , and six million <unk> will fail to handle .
and people will be flooded .
so they think , you know , these dirty technologies are going to stifle life in New York .
so what happened ? 40 years later , in 1900 , there was one , two million automobile companies in the United States -- one , four million cars .
finding a new technology is not only sustainable , but flat @-@ lined plants and a lot more .
the Ford Motor Company , among other things , was the Ford Motor Company in Michigan .
however , there &apos;s a secret to the entrepreneurs .
first of all , you have to <unk> their commitment .
they &apos;re not going to come to you .
and then you have to offer them a passion for commitment .
you have to tell them what entrepreneurship is .
whether it &apos;s a large company or a small company , there are three things that you can do : you have to work hard , you have to be smart , you have to be smart .
what &apos;s the problem ?
no one in the world has ever been able to do it at the same time and sell and finance .
this person doesn &apos;t exist .
people like this haven &apos;t yet been born .
we did a survey where we studied 100 workers in the world -- Carnegie training companies , Edison , of the Ford Motor Company , and all of these companies , <unk> , Yahoo .
all successful businesses in the world have only one thing in common : no business is created by one .
now we have students at the age of 16 in <unk> , and we started <unk> Richard Branson with us about how many times we could use this word &quot; Richard Branson . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t do it once . &quot; we did it 32 times .
he wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
nobody could start a business alone . nobody .
so we can build a community , and in this community , we have the expertise from the local community , from the <unk> in the cafe , from the pub , from the pub , where we can offer you , what do you want ?
what can you do ? can you make it ?
can you sell it ? can you run the money ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , this one I can &apos;t afford . &quot; does it mean I have some help for you ? &quot;
we inspire local communities to do business .
we have volunteers who help to pool the resources and the resources to pool our businesses , and what we find is that local people can create miracles that can change the culture and the economy , as long as you can use that passion , this energy .
thank you .
five years ago , I had this experience of <unk> Alice &apos;s bust .
the State University of Pennsylvania gave me a way to teach the teachers to communicate with each other .
I was terrified .
and I was really frightened . the heads of the students , the <unk> of the brain , and the <unk> words that they read , and the long , long @-@ term , were all <unk> .
but as the dialogue began , my experience was as if Alice had fallen through that rabbit hole , and saw that <unk> across into a completely new world .
that &apos;s how I felt when I was talking to the students , and I was surprised by their ideas , and I wanted others to experience it in their heads .
and I believe the key to opening that door is to have excellent communication .
in order to change the world , we really need to learn from our scientists and our engineers that have a great conversation .
our scientists and engineers solve the biggest problem we face , from energy to environment to health care , and so on . if we don &apos;t understand anything , they don &apos;t have a meaning for us , and I believe we have a responsibility for interacting with them as scientists .
but if our scientists and engineers aren &apos;t going to take our <unk> and look at their <unk> , there &apos;s no way we can communicate well .
so scientists and engineers , please tell us what high @-@ tech is .
I want to share with you a few powerful ways to tell you how to make sure that we also think of your science as sexy and sexy .
the first question is , what about high @-@ tech ?
tell us why your science is relevant to us .
and I want to tell you about <unk> , which is to tell you that this skeleton is important to understand and treat people .
and the other thing that you want to look at is the usage of the term .
the term is that we understand a obstacle to your ideas .
and of course , you can say , &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; but why not space and time ? that &apos;s a lot easier for us .
let your ideas be easy to understand and to simplify it .
instead , as Einstein said , let &apos;s make everything as simple as possible , rather than simplify .
you don &apos;t have to change your perspective to convey your scientific theories .
you can think of it with examples and stories and analogies . these are the ones that excite you about what we &apos;re excited about .
and when I showed you the research , don &apos;t just use points .
have you ever thought about why a bullet might be called a bullet ?
what are the bullets doing ? the bullet kills people , and it can kill you .
these are not just boring slides , but largely dependent on the language of our brains , making us know what to do .
and this is an example made by Gordon Brown , which was much better . it showed us the extraordinary structure of the <unk> , even the unique design of the Eiffel Tower .
the trick here is to use simple , flat @-@ lined sentences to allow the viewer to take a little bit of an opinion , and then to give some images that can inspire our senses , and give us a deeper understanding of what &apos;s described .
these are the key tools that I think help us to open up the gate , to experience science and engineering .
so because the engineers I worked with and taught me about the academic wounds of my heart , I want to conclude with a equations .
with the science that you &apos;ve studied , you &apos;ve got your <unk> and your jargon , divided by the content , by sharing the content with the audience , and then multiply and multiplying the passion of what you &apos;re doing , it &apos;s going to mean , fully understanding , incredible interaction .
so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved the equation , everything is done , say high @-@ tech .
thank you .
one of my favorite words is &quot; <unk> &quot; in the Oxford <unk> .
not just because it sounds good .
and what it means is , &quot; A <unk> politicians . &quot;
and even though this was a great definition by a 19 @-@ century newspaper editor , he said , &quot; Your name is a guy like this , and he would not care for any party or theater , or any principle , he could have his words to win . &quot;
I don &apos;t know what the meaning of the word &quot; tell . &quot;
it &apos;s about the words that are associated with speech , I suppose .
but speech is important for the political center , and all politicians understand that they have to try to control their movements .
so for example , it &apos;s been a decade or two that allows the news to report the actual words of politicians on the ground .
and it &apos;s actually all because of a brave man , the great name of <unk> <unk> , which was proposed in Parliament .
he was incarcerated in London , but he was brave enough to have the courage to have enough courage to suggest in the parliament , and to the end that he had a lot of support in London .
and just a few years later , we had the first recorded word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
a lot of people think that phrases come from metal .
no , it comes from an E @-@ terrorist act .
but in order to really demonstrate how words and politics affect each other , I want to take you back to the United States , when it &apos;s just sitting there .
there was a question about how the George Washington , D.C. , their leaders .
they don &apos;t know .
why should we be the leaders of a republic ?
and that was a long time ago in Congress .
and there &apos;s a lot of advice , which seems to work .
I mean , some people want to call him the chief George Washington , and others call him George Washington , and others call him the <unk> of <unk> , the freedom of <unk> .
there &apos;s no <unk> &apos;s name .
some people just want to call him king .
they think it &apos;s a term that used and tested .
they didn &apos;t even stick to the monarchy , and their idea was that you could be the king of the election with a fixed master .
you know , it probably works .
and everyone was feeling sick and tired of it , in fact , because it lasted for three weeks .
I read a diary that was carried on in that moment , and it was , &quot; Yes , it &apos;s the issue . &quot;
and the reason that <unk> and <unk> is because of the Senate .
the Rio de Janeiro state government does not want to let Washington D.C.
they didn &apos;t want to call him the king just in case he or the <unk> of his or her .
so they gave him a name they could think of , the worst , the worst , the worst , the worst possible title .
and this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
they didn &apos;t make this title . I mean , this was a title before , but it was a conference .
same thing with the president of the jury .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be very physical at all .
there were a few smaller meetings , and there was a sense of government governance , but it was a title for nothing .
and that &apos;s why the Senate is not against this .
they said it was ridiculous , you couldn &apos;t call him a meeting host .
and this guy had to sign the Harris and then see the <unk> .
who &apos;s going to take it seriously , if he had a little nonsense like this , like the federal government host the United Nations ?
and after three weeks of argument , there was no <unk> at all .
instead , they agree with &quot; <unk> , &quot; but they also want to be absolutely certain that they &apos;re not comfortable with the respect and the respect of the civilization @-@ state , whether it &apos;s the Republicans or the Republicans or the Republicans or the Republicans or the <unk> , that they &apos;re going to get to the point where we don &apos;t want to be , quote , &quot; We don &apos;t want to be <unk> . &quot;
now you can see three interesting things in this story .
first of all , it &apos;s my favorite place , and so far I &apos;ve been able to find the case of the Senate , where the Senate has never been properly recognized .
Barack Obama , the title of &quot; President Obama , &quot; came to the point where we &apos;re still waiting for the Senate , just appointed .
the second thing you can see is that when the U.S. government says this is a ad @-@ hoc act -- it &apos;s going to last a long time .
but the third thing you can see , and it &apos;s a very important thing , and I want you to remember the point , which is the name of the federal government , the president of the United States , doesn &apos;t it ever matter , doesn &apos;t it ?
more than 5,000 weapons were controlled by him , and the largest economy in the world , and a huge army of <unk> and military forces .
reality and history gave this exclusive meaning .
so the Senate won .
they got a great title for their honor .
and the other thing about the Senate , which is somewhat bizarre -- oh , it sounds strange in those days .
but now , do you know how many countries now have a president ?
<unk> .
and that &apos;s because they wanted their title to sound like the guy with 5,000 weapons , etc .
so at the end of the Senate , the Senate , winning the House of the House , because no one &apos;s ever heard that they are now President of the federal government .
and it &apos;s a very important lesson , and I think what you can learn , and that &apos;s the point I want to leave you with .
politicians <unk> very hard to define and use vocabulary to shape reality , but in fact , reality is far more than words .
thank you very much .
I was on the battles of 50 to the battle in <unk> , on a truck that I was 19 years old , a vegetable dealer .
I took my black <unk> , I changed my black <unk> , and I directed the tank of a brown pair of <unk> , and I looked at the <unk> government .
this was the first time I went to Afghanistan .
early on in the war , I grew up on weekends , watching a football game on Saturday , watching a boy with a racism and a group of religions shouting , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , Afghanistan ! &quot; and then , in fact , it doesn &apos;t even know what it means when it burns .
but that &apos;s how self @-@ formed .
so I &apos;m standing here today with the blood of Afghanistan , and the God @-@ given @-@ the @-@ art approach , an atheist and a radical political artist who has spent the last nine years in Afghanistan , working and writing .
in Afghanistan , you can create a lot of wonderful things with art , but I don &apos;t want to portray them in a lot of them , and I want to create the work of identity , the instruments of the challenge , the kinds of behavioral challenges , the kinds of behavioral challenges , and even using a kind of moral clarity to understand the world that we live in .
I want to live with a <unk> who lives in a <unk> <unk> <unk> , just like the <unk> <unk> of pop , and use the religious threats and the <unk> of himself to be rich .
these were the <unk> , except for the public , <unk> : &quot; choose me , choose me ! I &apos;m a <unk> . I &apos;m a <unk> ! &quot;
I was trying to use elections to justify the <unk> of the <unk> , to become the heroes of the nation .
I wanted to use a work called &quot; <unk> , &quot; to look at corruption in Afghanistan , and to simulate a policeman in Kabul , in the streets of Kabul , to stop those cars , not a bribe , but to the name of the police station in Kabul , to the name of Afghanistan .
I wanted to know what to do with my point of view , to channel the conflict of Afghanistan , to the art of conflict .
the war and the <unk> of the war created a kind of a style @-@ style and fashion that was designed specifically to create a fashion for the soldiers and the suicide bomber , and I added a local <unk> hairs on the <unk> with the brand of Afghanistan .
and I also wanted to put together a simple <unk> of Kabul and <unk> , to see how modern art can come from the old days of the <unk> of the <unk> of contemporary art , the so @-@ called &quot; white &quot; to save the naked skin , even a little bit of a civilization .
but to do that , you might be in prison , and they would be accused of being <unk> .
but I had to do what I had to do , because my ego asked me to do .
that &apos;s my burden . what about yours ?
thank you .
Hi . I mean , Cameron Russell . I used to be a model model .
well , 10 years .
now , I felt a kind of <unk> in this room because I wasn &apos;t supposed to wear a dress .
and Gene took another set .
this is the first live stage at TED , so I think there &apos;s been a lot of lucky people here .
if some of the women were terrified of me , I didn &apos;t have to tell me , but I was going to Twitter right now .
and I want to tell you that I &apos;m fortunate enough to be able to change my image in 10 seconds .
it &apos;s not something everyone can do .
and the high @-@ density is uncomfortable , and the good news is I &apos;m not going to wear them .
the worst news is I &apos;m going to take this sweater off the head , because you &apos;re going to laugh at me , so when I wear my glasses , I don &apos;t do anything .
there it is .
so why do I do this ?
it &apos;s a strange thing .
I don &apos;t want to be that way .
the imagery is powerful , but it &apos;s also powerful .
I just changed my mind in six seconds .
in this photo , I actually don &apos;t have a boyfriend in real life .
when the photographer had to relax my back , I was very ill at the hair of that guy .
and sure enough , besides surgery or like two days ago , the brown brown brown thing that I did for my job , we basically couldn &apos;t change our appearance , even though it was <unk> , and it had a huge impact on our lives .
so today , for me , the president of the change means honesty .
I stand here today because I &apos;m a model .
I &apos;m on this stage because I &apos;m a beautiful , white woman who we call &quot; sexy girl . &quot;
and I want to answer that question that people often ask me in a very honest way .
the first question is , how do you become a model ?
and I always say , &quot; I &apos;m discovered , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t really mean anything .
the real reason I became a model model model was because I had great genes , and I was a <unk> receiver , and you might be asking what the legacy is .
well , in the last couple of centuries , we &apos;ve defined beauty , not only in wellness , but in young and small bodies , because of the nature of our biological instincts , but also in <unk> , in color , in color , in color , in the skin .
this is my legacy . this is my legacy .
I know some of you may have a kind of a cult of this idea that you might have some fashion @-@ oriented , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
first of all , I &apos;d like to give you credit for what you know about models .
but unfortunately , I have to tell you , in 2007 , a Ph.D. from NYU , was inspired by the number of people who were models in the workforce , and only 27 of them were actually paid up , less than four percent .
the next question people ask me was , &quot; Can I be a model ? &quot;
my first answer was , &quot; I don &apos;t know , because they didn &apos;t let me take care of it . &quot;
but the second answer , which I want to ask , is , &quot; Why ? &quot;
you know what ? you can choose any profession .
you can be the president of the United States , or the inventor of the Internet , or the next generation of ninja , which is great , because you &apos;re the first .
if you listen to this , they say , &quot; No , no , no , I want to be a model , &quot; and I say , &quot; When my boss . &quot;
because I can &apos;t define anything , you can be the editor of the pilot of the United States , or the next president of <unk> magazine , or Steven Johnson .
when you grow up , you want to be a model , like when you say you &apos;re growing up , you want to win a lottery .
you can &apos;t be a model . it &apos;s not within your grasp . it &apos;s a great model .
I &apos;m going to show you some of my models for a decade , because it &apos;s not like a super @-@ modern French poet , but it &apos;s a real , real inspiration .
so if the photographer is here , the camera is going to be -- like a beautiful <unk> client , &quot; I want to walk , &quot; I want to take a shot of the shutter while you walk , &quot; this long , long @-@ round arm , put it back in front of the arm , and it looks three @-@ quarters , and it looks like this , and then you look at 400 .
it looks like this .
I hope not like that one .
I didn &apos;t know what it was .
the reality is , when you graduate , you have your résumé , and you have your <unk> job , you can &apos;t say anything else , so if you say you want to be the president of the United States , but you put it on your résumé , where you smile for 10 years .
the next question people ask is , &quot; Are they looking for pictures ? &quot;
and yes , they almost took photographs , but this was a small part of the work .
this was the first prototype I ever had , a graphic model photograph , and I had my first hospitalization .
I knew it was a little private , but I was also young .
this was a photo I photographed with the grandmother a few months ago .
this is the picture of the day .
I was with my friends .
this is a picture I took from a few days ago in my pajamas at <unk> .
this is a picture of my team and <unk> magazine .
this is me right now .
I want you to understand that these are not my photographs .
it &apos;s based on a group of professionals , <unk> , photographers and <unk> and their <unk> and their <unk> , and then they create these imagery , and they make these images , not me .
the next question is , &quot; Can you get free ? &quot;
I really had no opportunity to wear eight inches high heels , but free was something that I got in the real world , and that &apos;s exactly what we didn &apos;t want to talk about .
when I was the mayor of Cambridge , I was walking into a shop and I forgot to take money and send me a dress .
when I was a teenager , I was driving with my friends , and she was a terrible driver , and we had a red light on it , and I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir . we &apos;re on the road .
I got this because my appearance wasn &apos;t me . some people pay for their appearance instead of identity .
I live in New York , and last year there were 14 million young boys who were parking in parking spaces , 86 percent of them were black and Latino , mostly young boys .
and in New York , young black and Latino men , there are only 17 million of them , so the question is , &quot; Am I going to be parking ? &quot;
it was , &quot; I &apos;m going to stop a few times ? when do I stop ? &quot;
and when I did this research , I found that in the 13 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , 53 percent of them didn &apos;t like their bodies to 17 , and that ratio went up to 78 percent .
so the last question is , &quot; What does a model feel like ? &quot;
and I guess the answer that they &apos;re looking forward to is , &quot; If you &apos;re a bit thinner , you have a little bit more <unk> of your hair , you &apos;re happier , it &apos;s unbelievable . &quot;
when we come back , we give an answer like this .
and we said , &quot; Look , it &apos;s great to be able to travel around and be creative .
and that &apos;s only half the truth , because what we &apos;re never going to say before is , I &apos;m never going to say , &quot; I &apos;m not safe . &quot;
because I had to worry about what I looked like every day .
and if you ever thought about it , if my thigh was ever smaller , my hair was better , would I be happier ?
you just have to go and look at models because they have the most thin coat of their legs , the most beautiful hair , the coolest clothes , and they &apos;re probably the most insecure woman in the world .
so when I was preparing for this talk , it was hard to find a sense of honesty , because on the one hand , I said , &quot; Look , I &apos;ve got so much pleasure out of nature &apos;s advantage , &quot; in my mind , it &apos;s uncomfortable to say , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t make me happy . &quot;
but the hardest part of all is to show you the tradition of gender and racism , because I am the most <unk> .
but at the same time , I was very happy and respected , standing there with respect , and I was young , not working for 10 , 20 , 30 years and model , and I couldn &apos;t get the most direct sense , because maybe I wasn &apos;t going to talk about how my first job was , and I &apos;m going to show you how important these things are .
and if this talk gives you a bit of benefits , I hope that we all embrace the power of imagery , the success of the image and the failure that we understand .
thank you .
I just want one thing to do today .
don &apos;t say I &apos;m sane .
I want to introduce you to my two brothers .
he was 22 years old .
he wasn &apos;t speaking , but he was able to convey a sense of pleasure in a very particular way , and the best of his talk is to speak .
he knows what love is .
he was <unk> , sharing that love .
he doesn &apos;t care what other people are .
he didn &apos;t care about religion , and he said , &quot; He never did . &quot;
and when he was singing out of our childhood <unk> , he even forgotten the lyrics that we don &apos;t know so much about , it was so fascinating .
that year &apos;s 16 , and that &apos;s the hot .
he had extraordinary memory .
but the memory is selective .
he didn &apos;t remember stealing my chocolate , but remember when I was released in the iPod , when I was four years old , we were talking about <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on my arm , and also the <unk> of the Lady of <unk> .
sounds pretty incredible .
but a lot of people don &apos;t think that .
the truth is , because they don &apos;t match the definition of normal people , they &apos;re often isolated , <unk> .
but what blew my mind was that even though they were not seen as normal , it was just one thing that was remarkable , even though they were having autism , that was remarkable .
some of you may not know too much about it , but it &apos;s a term called &quot; autism , &quot; and it &apos;s caused by complex brain disorders , and it &apos;s sometimes a form of social disorders .
every single case is different , so it &apos;s different from Sam .
in the world , every 20 minutes , there &apos;s a new diagnosis of autism , and yet this is one of the fastest @-@ growing diseases of the world , but we don &apos;t know the reason why it &apos;s so potent .
and I knew for the first time that &quot; autism &quot; had occurred to me that one day I knew nothing about autism .
when I was three , my brother was born , and I was so excited that I had a new family .
and just a few months later , I realized he was different .
he was screaming .
he didn &apos;t want to play like any other baby , but it was like he wasn &apos;t interested in me .
and when he was in his own world , he was using his own principles , and he was looking for fun , like <unk> around the room , looking at all the washing machines and the washing machines .
as he grew up , he became more unique in these special places .
apart from the fact that the <unk> of the usual world , the depression and the <unk> of the face of his face , he was a man who never would ever lie .
it &apos;s too simple .
I couldn &apos;t deny the family that there was a tough time , and I thought they were like me .
but then I moved to what they taught me about my identity and communication and love and love , and I realized that these things I didn &apos;t want to be normal .
the differences between the five and the other side of the equation are not true .
it &apos;s just that there are different kinds of facts .
I just want to say a word , for Sam , for those of you who don &apos;t necessarily have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
whether it &apos;s autism or not , there &apos;s a difference between us -- every one of us has a gift to be fair , to be honest , to seek &quot; normal &quot; is to kill the potential .
the possibility of transcendence , progress and change is that we want to disappear from others .
don &apos;t say I &apos;m normal . &quot;
thank you .
Dr. <unk> took this photo of the courage and curiosity , and this is a photograph of only a million seconds .
but now , 50 years later , we can get a million times faster , a million times faster , not only in a million seconds , but in a billion seconds , to capture the world .
now I &apos;m going to show you a new kind of camera technology called the <unk> imaging , which is a technology that has gotten so quickly that it captures light .
so with this technology , we can make cameras out of the corners of the light , and we can see beyond the horizon , or we can &apos;t see the camera in our bodies , the camera challenges our definition of the camera .
now , if I use a laser pen , and within one trillion seconds a turn -- that &apos;s a couple of times -- I &apos;m going to create some photons , and these photons are just <unk> across , and those photons , like bullet points , are going to a million times slower .
now , what if you put the bullet in this bottle , these photons pouring in ?
what &apos;s the slow speed of light ?
now , the whole thing ...
now , remember , this whole thing was happening inside a single plate -- the <unk> time -- but now I &apos;m going to slow this video down a million times .
but Coke has not funded this .
now , there &apos;s a lot of things going on here , so let me give you a demonstration .
now , the beam is entering the bottle , which is our bullet , crossing the bottle , and pushing it inside .
some got out and went to the table , so you started seeing these patterns .
many photons eventually got to the caps and went all around .
as you can see , here &apos;s an air bubble , it <unk> inside .
and at the same time , the waves went to the table , and because of the reflection at the top , you can see that at the bottom of the bottle , the reflected connections .
now , if you walk the same amount of miles as a normal bullet , you slow down video , and you know how long you need to wait for this process ?
one day , one ? actually , a year .
this is , of course , boring , regular bullet points .
but what about some of these ?
you can see the pattern over and over again , the background is the tomato and the wall .
it &apos;s like throwing a rock in a shower .
and I think that &apos;s how nature builds tomatoes , a <unk> , but of course our eyes are integrated .
but if you look at this tomatoes , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> is on the tomato , it &apos;s all <unk> . it &apos;s not dim .
why ? because tomatoes know , and the inside of the <unk> , comes out in one second after the thousands of seconds .
so in the future , when imaging cameras are in your cell phone , you can go to the mall and you can check your fruit .
so how did my team at MIT get this camera ?
now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to wear light , you only have a little bit of light , but we need a million times faster , so you don &apos;t get any light .
so what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re taking all these photons and we &apos;re going to do it all the time , and we &apos;re going to do it all over again , and we &apos;re going to make a picture , and this is what you saw .
and we take all of that data and add it to it , and it &apos;s fun to do it .
now , Superman can fly .
some other heroes could disappear , but imagine a future hero : he could see things underneath .
and that &apos;s how we can put some of the door to the door .
these lights reflect into the room , and some of them go back to the door and go into the camera , so we can use those reflection .
that &apos;s not true . we did .
on the left you see our intensified camera .
in the back of the wall , we had a <unk> .
so in our paper , we published it in &quot; Nature , &quot; which was recommend the <unk> online , and they created this animation .
we &apos;re going to launch these bullets , and they &apos;re going to hit the wall , and because the light &apos;s going to come in all directions , some of them will end up beating into our hidden <unk> , and it will continue to know that the gate will bounce back into some of light , but some of them will come back to the camera , and they will be playful .
and because we have a camera that can run so fast , that &apos;s our camera camera , and that camera has a specific capability .
it &apos;s got a good time resolution , and it can capture the world at the speed of light .
so , not only do we know where the camera gate is , but we know where the distance is , but we don &apos;t know which distance is .
by using a laser , we can record an original photo , which you see here on the screen , which is kind of meaningless , but then we &apos;ll take a lot of pictures , put them together , put them together , and we &apos;ll see that hidden object .
can we look at the <unk> ?
that &apos;s our model .
now we &apos;ve used them to take a few of them to live , but in the future , we can put this technology into the car , so they can prevent collisions , because we can see the <unk> , or we can look at the reflection of the body , or we can see the device in the window .
but of course , because of the kinds of distractions of tissues and blood , it &apos;s quite difficult , so we &apos;re asking scientists to really value <unk> , to take this technology as a new model for the next generation .
now , like Dr. Love <unk> , a scientist , science has become art , a high @-@ speed wave , and I realize that every time we collect a lot of data , not just science imaging , but a new kind of computational photography , this technique contains and color code , and we just remember that pattern of pattern .
but something interesting is happening .
when you see the pattern of the lid , they &apos;re moving away from us .
but the pattern should move us .
what happened ?
and it turns out , because we &apos;re doing these things at the speed of light , we have these strange things , and Einstein will be pretty happy to see them .
the sequence of events occurred in the camera is sometimes turned upside down , so by <unk> of time and space , we can actually alter the trajectory of this .
so whether we see the corner , whether it &apos;s for the next generation or for the next generation , or for the next generation , we &apos;ve put all of the data and all the details online , and we want to , this new , creative research group , to tell us that we shouldn &apos;t get into the next big picture -- the technology begins to be more interesting .
it &apos;s about time . thank you .
this is where I live , Kenya , in the southern part of Nairobi National Park .
behind me , my father &apos;s cows in the back of the cow was the National Park in Kenya .
the southern part of the National Park has not been gathered around the fence , which means that in zebras , they can move freely off the park .
so predators like lions follow their behavior .
they killed our livestock .
this is one of the cows that was killed at night , and I found it dead in the morning , and my feeling has so much in it , because it &apos;s the only thing that I have at home .
our <unk> believed that we were bringing our animals and our home to make our grazing , to save our lives , and that &apos;s why we value them .
so I became very interested in lions .
the mangroves were the ones that protected our families and their livestock , but they were also depressed about this , and they were frustrated .
so they decided to killed the lions .
this is one of six lions killed by the National Park in Nairobi .
and I think that &apos;s the reason why this is so small in Nairobi .
in our family , where six to nine percent of boys have the responsibility to protect their father , the same cause happens to me .
so I had to find a solution .
the first way I thought about it was using fire , because I knew that lions were terrified of fire .
but I realized that it didn &apos;t work , it didn &apos;t help the lion to see our face .
but I didn &apos;t give up . I was staying .
so there &apos;s a second way : use the grass .
I wanted to deceive lions to get them right next to me .
but lions are very clever .
and the first day they came , and they went back , but the next day , they would come back and say , &quot; This thing has never happened , and he stayed here . &quot;
so they &apos;re killing animals .
one night , I was walking around with my flashlight , and the lions didn &apos;t come .
I started to realize that lions tend to fear the light of moving .
so I had an idea .
because I was a kid , and I could just spend a couple of days in my own room , and one day and a half , I even killed my mom &apos;s radio star , and that day she almost killed me , and I learned a lot about electronics .
so I found an old <unk> , an old <unk> , an assessment . this is a small piece of equipment that was found in a motorcycle that was able to control the <unk> of a motorcycle .
and at the same time , I found a switch that I was able to control the light of the lights .
the light bulb came from a broken flashlight .
everything was ready .
as you can see , the solar cell picks up a battery , gives it a battery , gives it an indication of the energy , and I call it the <unk> .
and this particular pointer actually <unk> the light .
and as you can see , the light bulb was pretty hot , because lions come from there .
and what you see when the lion comes up at night is this .
the light would actually cause a lion to get a request as if I was walking around a lion &apos;s room , but in fact , I was doing my own big dreams on the bed .
thank you .
I had put this in my home two years ago , and since then , we had no <unk> of lions .
my neighbors had heard about it .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a whole bunch of <unk> fed @-@ up with lions , and she asked if I could help her with a light at home .
I couldn &apos;t believe .
I have these lights , and as you can see behind , these are the <unk> .
so far , I &apos;ve been able to put this in our family &apos;s home system , and they &apos;re very useful .
now , my approach has been used by anyone in Kenya to avoid other species of predatory animals , like hyena , and the leopard was also used to avoid the human farm .
and I was also very lucky , because this was the one that was the best school in Kenya -- the international school -- I was excited about this .
my new school now comes in and helps me raise more money .
I even brought my friends back to my community , helping them to install this in people without <unk> .
a year ago , I was just a normal kid in a savanna to help his dad , and I used to look at the plane , and tell myself , one day , I &apos;ll be inside .
today , I did .
I got an opportunity to go to TED . this is my first time .
so my great dream was : when I grew up , I became an airplane engineer and a pilot .
I used to hate lions , but now , because of my invention , I saved my father &apos;s cattle and we were able to get lions alive .
thank you very much . in my language , it means very much .
you can &apos;t believe how inspiring your story is .
so you &apos;ve got this scholarship . Richard Wurman : yes .
are you doing another electron inventing ?
what &apos;s your next project ?
next invention : my next invention was , I wanted to do an electric fence .
LM : I know , the electricity booms are already there , but I just want to do my own one .
you &apos;ve tried it one time , right , but -- You know , I &apos;ve tried it before , but I stopped , because it <unk> me .
it &apos;s going to be a blessing . Richard <unk> , you &apos;re different .
we &apos;re going to do it for every step you grew up , friends .
thank you very much . <unk> : thank you .
I live in Los Angeles .
this is L.A. <unk> : hotel , fast food restaurants .
so the planners of the city , they sat around and talked about what it means to take Los Angeles , and so they changed it to South Los Angeles , as though it &apos;s going to be the problem .
this is Los Angeles .
<unk> hotels , soon enough food .
I live in a desert where I live , like other 200 million people in the United States .
and the interesting thing is that there were more people killed by cars .
in Los Angeles , people were dying to cure disease .
for example , one of the neighborhoods in my neighborhood was five times the size of our neighborhood , maybe eight times bigger than the rest of us .
I was tired of the reality .
and at the same time , if there &apos;s no way to get healthy food , what do you feel if you come out of your home and see the food systems that are available in your community , what do you feel ?
I saw the wheelchair as a bought @-@ <unk> car .
I see the <unk> center like Starbucks .
I don &apos;t want to get there anymore .
I think the answer is already in the question .
food is the problem , and food is the solution .
and with that , I was tired of taking a 45 @-@ minute trip and buying an apple that wasn &apos;t calling .
so what I did was I put food in my house .
it &apos;s in what we call a <unk> .
150 feet by 10 feet .
<unk> all over the government .
but someone always needs to maintain it .
so I thought , &quot; Great ! this is my responsibility , I have to maintain it , so I want to do anything . &quot;
that &apos;s why I maintain it .
so my team and I , &quot; L.A. &quot; came together and we started growing our own food forests , and we had a whole variety of vegetable dishes .
we &apos;re a free @-@ institutional construction , a collection of different architects , all volunteers , all of which we do .
the garden was beautiful .
but very quickly somebody complained .
the government accused me , gave me a break , and I had to take away my garden and turn it into a warning .
and I was like , &quot; What , really ?
and it wasn &apos;t enough to do it in a small patch of land and nobody was interested in it .
and I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s it . &quot;
because it didn &apos;t happen .
so the Los Angeles Times article reported , Steven Pinker wrote a story about it and talked to the legislators and a <unk> community , and they brought it to <unk> and <unk> , and took over 900 signed , we succeeded .
we succeeded with our hands .
and even the legislators came to visit , and it was an admiration for him to be so admired and to love what we were doing .
I mean , of course , how can they do it ?
the number of empty spaces in Los Angeles had in the upper quarter .
it had 26 square kilometers .
that &apos;s 20 Central Park .
there &apos;s enough room to grow 250 million tomato species .
why do they feel so bad ?
a single tree can be received by a thousand , a handful of seeds .
a dollar <unk> can produce 75 dollars for you .
this is my motto , and I tell people , grow your own food .
it &apos;s like its own <unk> .
see , I had the legacy in Los Angeles .
I grew up there , and I was raising my son there .
I refused to be part of the reality that someone else built for me .
see , I &apos;m an artist .
the work of the garden was my graffiti , creating my own art .
it &apos;s like the graffiti artist , <unk> the wall , and I , <unk> the lawns , <unk> .
I see the garden and the land as canvas , and plants and trees are the decoration of my canvas .
you may be shocked to see what land would be like if you saw it as your canvas .
you can &apos;t imagine how amazing it was , and what it would do to people .
what happens ?
I watched my garden become the tools of education , became the tool of my community reform .
to change the community , you have to change the components of the soil .
we are soil .
you &apos;d be shocked by how children affected .
the gardening movement is the most healthy and challenging activity , especially in the inner city .
add that to your partner .
and I remember one day when a mom and daughter came out of nowhere at about 10 o &apos;clock in the morning , and when I came out , they were embarrassed .
their presence made me feel bad , and I told them , you don &apos;t have to take food like this .
this is the reason why it &apos;s on the street .
and when I saw people standing around me , it made me feel incredibly valuable . and that made me do my job . people ask me , &quot; Why don &apos;t you steal your food ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; Yes , of course , I &apos;m sure people will steal it .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
that &apos;s what I wanted .
I want people to take it , but at the same time , I want people to be healthy . &quot;
and one of the other things that happened to me when I was in the middle of Los Angeles was a homeless garden .
these guys helped me figure out what was possible .
it &apos;s cool . they shared stories about how the garden affects them and how they shared with their own mother and their grandmother , seeing that the garden can change the way they &apos;re really cool , just for this moment .
green spaces started to place , maybe 20 gardens .
we &apos;ve got about 50 people involved in our team ; they &apos;re all volunteers .
if the kids grow food , the kids eat it .
if they plant the tomato , they eat the tomato .
but when these kids are not present in front of their eyes , if they don &apos;t realize how food affects people &apos;s thoughts and bodies , they &apos;re just <unk> eating food in front of them .
I saw young people who wanted to work , but they were happy to spend time with this , and I saw children with different skin color , and they were always <unk> on the way they were designing for them , and there was a road .
and as the gardening campaign , I found an opportunity to train these kids to take over their communities , to live a sustainable life .
when we did that , who knew whether we were going to be there .
next George Washington .
but if we don &apos;t change the soil , we will never .
this led to one of my current plans . this is what I want to do .
I wanted a whole neighborhood garden of gardens where people could share food .
I wanted to turn the shipping container into a healthy ship .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
I didn &apos;t think about free , because free is not sustainable .
and the beauty of sustainability is that you must keep it .
what I &apos;m talking about is getting people to work , to get kids out of the street , to get their joy , their honor , their pride , the pride , the open farmers .
so what I wanted to do was to make this project more appealing .
I wanted us to be the president of the environmental revolution , the rogue , the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to bend rogue .
if you &apos;re not a choreographer , you &apos;re not a rogue .
<unk> &apos;s rogue with a <unk> ?
let alone become the weapons you choose .
basically , if you want to meet me , if you want to meet me , if you want to be in a comfortable seat , don &apos;t even call me .
and if you want me , just take the garden and come to the garden , then we can just fill it up .
thank you .
thank you .
three months before 2011 , I was a photographer for photography , New York .
we &apos;re going to do it all together .
we are in a room of pitch , <unk> , no windows , mostly for the sun .
we were able to take a model that was thinner , to make the skin <unk> perfectly translucent , to make the impossible possible , and we were criticized by the media , but we were actually artists , experienced , to see images and photographs .
on March 11th , 2011 , as others around the world , I saw the tragedy of Japan at home .
soon after that , I was part of a volunteer organization called &quot; volunteer , &quot; and teams got together , and within a few days , there was a local disaster relief .
and I knew a lot about everybody else : we couldn &apos;t sit at home . so I decided to join them for three weeks and volunteer .
on May 13 , I went to Japan .
it was a small fishing village in Japan , and it was about 50,000 people , and it was about 70 million people .
the tsunami was at a time of about 24 meters , a shock about two miles .
and as you can imagine , this little town must have suffered .
we came out of this rubble and into the <unk> .
we &apos;re helping schools and the lost homes to clean , cleaning up , to rebuild , to rebuild .
we cleaned up a lot of <unk> , <unk> fish , which were all local factories and processed fish .
we also became very smelly and <unk> , but we were very upset .
and within weeks , all the volunteers , like the local people , found something like this .
and they kept finding photos , photographers and <unk> .
everybody &apos;s reaction to that .
they took all of these photographs and collected them to <unk> them .
and until now , I realized that these photographs must be a big part of the loss .
and when they were attacked by the tsunami , you know , they were always <unk> , they were looking for other things , and everything was left behind .
I was staying in Japan for the last couple of days , and I found myself in a place where I was working for a <unk> .
help a <unk> clean ground .
there was a photo that was lost in the area of the <unk> .
people were taking pictures of it to that location , and I was very privileged to get their trust , to start clean , to get back to the photos .
and the moments of shock , and it &apos;s very inspiring , and I &apos;ve been listening to people and saying , &quot; I &apos;ve got ideas , &quot; until I got the pictures out of them , and I really did what I call &quot; innovation . &quot;
and when I look at those pictures , there are perhaps more than a hundred years of history , some of which are still saved in the lab , and I think from a single point of view , perhaps I can help them repair the photos of the <unk> and the <unk> , and I also know that a lot of people will help them recover .
so on that evening , I went to Facebook and I asked some friends , and I was in the morning , and there was a lot of news , and there was a lot of news , and I knew that we should do it .
so we started <unk> .
this is the first shot .
it wasn &apos;t a hell of a lot of damage , but it was caused by a very ugly face to a little girl &apos;s face , and we had to repair it very carefully .
otherwise , the face of a little girl doesn &apos;t look like her face -- a tragedy or a tragedy , just like a picture .
and over time , more and more photos were brought to the repair , and we also needed more money to deal with these pictures , and then I went back to the Facebook web and the professional links , and just five days , there were eight people who came from 12 different countries .
within two weeks , I got 150 volunteers and they were willing to join us .
and by the time of July , just in Japan , we set up a small tree of <unk> , a kind of south @-@ branch of the north .
every week , we create devices in the form of ad @-@ hoc form , where people come and play with photographs of them .
sometimes , some of the older women have never seen a scanner , and they &apos;ve found their own picture , and within 10 minutes , they can scan it to us , upload it to the cloud , upload it to the cloud , uploading it to maybe a Japanese or strangers , maybe some photos from the other side of the Earth .
and for that time , they took all the time back to the pictures , and , of course , it depends on damage .
it could be fixed for an hour , probably for a few weeks .
it was even months .
the beauty of this picture has to be processed by hand , or by inch , or by bit , to get rid of the color of the dead where there &apos;s no water left .
the whole process is very much time .
all of these photographs that were affected by the tsunami , in the brine , in the trash , in the trash , are lost in the trash , sometimes in the presence of oil , and all of these photographs that have been taken over for a period of time , so it &apos;s a big part of this project .
and if these pictures don &apos;t clean first , we can &apos;t do anything , repair them , and they have to dry and dry them .
our hand @-@ washing activities were pretty good .
there &apos;s a lady in the local who <unk> us .
these pictures are very easy to damage again .
as the captain of my team once said , it &apos;s like doing tattoos on people .
you can &apos;t make a mess with it , otherwise it will make a mess .
the woman who gave us the photo was very lucky , in this case .
she also started washing her pictures , until she realized that she had more damage to the photo .
and she had a copy of that picture .
otherwise , in this photograph , she and her face was completely <unk> , and we were able to pull all of those parts into a good photo and then re @-@ create this photo .
and when she took the picture here , she shared some stories with us .
her photo was actually found by her husband &apos;s colleague , and after the local fire brigade , the place was actually very far away from her family , they recognized him .
the day of the tsunami , he was making sure that the tsunami was closed .
an alarm goes on , and he has to rush to the front lines .
her two sons , though , were too big , and they were in two different schools .
one of the kids was shocked by the tsunami .
she took a whole week to find her family back , and they were both dead .
and the day after that came back , we were on the 14th birthday of her son .
and for her , despite the extraordinary tragedy of the catastrophe and the hard work , the pictures were the best gift to his son , the pictures that allowed him to <unk> , to remember , to remember , that it was no longer a <unk> of a day when he left his life , when all of his life changed , or destroyed .
in Japan , after six months in Japan , there &apos;s a group of 100 volunteers to join in Japan , working together to help us to clean up more than 15 million photos , most of which -- most of them .
and most of those ended up in the back pocket , and it &apos;s important .
more than 500 volunteers around the world have given us a photo of 90 families , and they &apos;re all reconstructed and <unk> .
during this time , we didn &apos;t spend tens of millions of dollars of equipment or materials , and most of it was done with a printer .
we take pictures .
it &apos;s a photo of a remind and a reminder that some of us , some things , some place , a place of affection and a loved ones .
they were given us recording , remembering recall and our past , and the photo was the most easy time to ever be looked at , but sometimes the first thing we wanted to get back .
and that &apos;s all of the little pieces of this project , and it &apos;s going to take care of people &apos;s lives in the past .
and when a photo came back to its owner , it would bring a huge difference , a very different life , a huge difference .
and this has really changed our lives .
and for some of the <unk> , this experience set up some connections to them , to some bigger things , such as back @-@ to @-@ society , to exercise their talents , not only for the model , for the perfect skin .
I &apos;d like to end by giving you an email , and I get an email from <unk> , six months later , from Japan .
&quot; when I was working on those photographs , I was reminded of the stories that each of them and the photographs that came from .
and in particular , a woman who took photographs of a woman , went to a grandmother , went down to a little baby , and it was a lot of shock , because I had a picture of my grandmother , my mother , my mother , my daughter , my daughter , in my house .
across the globe , over age boundaries , we have some of the most fundamental needs to continue , right ? &quot;
thank you .
today , I want to talk to you about a disconcerting , and the answer to that question also <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk about the secret of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; Why is she leaving behind ? &quot;
&quot; why would somebody want to live with her men ? &quot;
I &apos;m not a psychopath , a social worker , a social worker .
I &apos;m just a woman with a personal story .
I was 22 years old , just graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York , and I started my first job as a magazine magazine and a <unk> .
the first time I had my house , I had the first credit card . I had a very big secret .
and the secret was that I was once identified as a man of my soul , using this thing as a gun @-@ filled gun @-@ pressed gun @-@ pressed against my head as many times .
this man that I always loved was pointing at my head and threatening to kill me , and I couldn &apos;t remember how many times I had done .
now the story that I &apos;ve told you about this &quot; crazy love &quot; is a psychological trap , a woman who has millions of women every year , including some men who fall into this trap .
maybe it &apos;s happening to you .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic victim .
I had a college degree of English education and an MBA at Harvard Business School .
most of the time was working for the Fortune 500 companies , including Johnson , and Washington Post .
I married my husband for almost 20 years with three children .
I had a black <unk> , a <unk> van .
and that &apos;s the first thing I want to tell you about : that domestic violence may not happen to everyone ; it &apos;s not about your ethnicity , faith , income and education .
it &apos;s everywhere .
the second thing I want to talk about is that many people think that if domestic violence occurs to women , it should be women .
no .
over 85 percent of boys are men , and domestic violence only happens in intimacy , in a long @-@ term relationship , in other words , in families , it &apos;s a place where we don &apos;t want to , or what we don &apos;t want to see , and that &apos;s one of the reasons why we call domestic violence .
I used to think that only one person in the world would continue to stay with my men , but it was actually very common in my age .
I was 22 years old . whereas in the United States , 16 to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds were more likely to be killed by more women than any other woman , or husband .
I was a very typical victim , because I had no idea what the <unk> and development of domestic violence was .
I met <unk> at a time when it was January , and it was cold .
we sat around on the subway in New York , and he talked to me first .
he told me two things .
the first one was that he graduated from Connecticut school , and worked in a very good Wall Street .
but the first thing that really impressed me was his wisdom and humor , and his <unk> seemed like a farm boy .
his face looked like a giant apple orchard , like a giant apple , looked very glamorous .
one of the most brilliant things that happened to me in the first few days was to convince me that I was a strong side .
and at the beginning , he made me feel that I was an icon of his worship .
we started getting involved , and he liked everything I was about , like my brilliant , I was at Harvard University , and I was giving my teenage girls a career .
he wanted to know my family , my childhood , my wish and my dreams .
as a woman and a <unk> , I had never been there before .
and through his unknown secrets , he creates this incredible emotional environment between us , and he told me that he begins his four @-@ year @-@ olds , and he began his whole body abuse , so that he had to drop out in eighth grade , even though he had been a pretty smart life .
and that &apos;s why the degrees of return to university , the work of Wall Street , the bright future , is significant to him .
if somebody said to me at that time that this smart , humor , <unk> and love my man will have one day to tell me whether I wear makeup , my dress will be short , what I &apos;m doing , what I &apos;m doing , what I &apos;m going to be able to tell you , which Christmas , because I &apos;m going to laugh at you , because I don &apos;t know if I don &apos;t have any violence or control one .
and I didn &apos;t know that , <unk> and <unk> were the first step in terms of domestic violence .
I didn &apos;t know , the second stage was isolated .
he didn &apos;t come home . he said to me , &quot; Hey , you know , it &apos;s a great thing to do , but we &apos;re going to take you to the next phase of this , and I &apos;m going to abuse you , so I &apos;m going to leave your own apartment , prevent your neighbor , and I &apos;m going to leave you with your friends and family . &quot;
and the truth is , he came home at a Friday night and told me he quit his job , and he always wanted to do his job , and he said he quit his job because I quit my job as a New England , and he didn &apos;t have to prove that he didn &apos;t have to go to Wall Street . and now he wants to go to a place of his normal , because he left his family .
what I didn &apos;t want to do at the time was to leave New York and leave my passion , but for my own soul , I thought I needed to make a sacrifice . so I agreed to quit my job and leave Manhattan with my wife .
I thought I &apos;d come into this crazy romantic love and I didn &apos;t know I &apos;d walked into a elaborate <unk> control of your body , your heart and your economy .
the second phase of domestic violence is starting to look at her response to violence .
that &apos;s what the gun used .
we just moved to the New England town -- and I think the <unk> should be feeling safe here -- he bought the gun .
and one of them was put in a van .
a pillow underneath the bed , the window is still in your pocket .
he said the post @-@ traumatic event that he needed was a gun .
to keep him safe .
the gun was a obvious signal to me , although he didn &apos;t pick up the dot to me , I was on the verge of no danger .
I was on my wedding night .
that was in the morning <unk> , and I was wearing <unk> .
I &apos;m working with a computer , and I &apos;m trying to get through the task of <unk> , and I was <unk> , and I was <unk> , and I was using my hands , my neck , my neck , my lungs , my <unk> , my breathing , crying out .
and then five days later , 10 fingers on my neck came back , and I was wearing my mom &apos;s <unk> and married him .
and despite all of that , I still believe that we can live in a very happy life , because we love it .
and he expressed his deep inner self .
he just got too much stress , and the wedding meet came and knocked him off .
this is an accident , and he will not hurt me later .
I was struck twice as much as I could .
for the first time , I was going to look for the secret beach , and I was lost , and he was beaten up by my head , and it was so heavy that my head would hit the glass on the wheel .
on the way home , on the way to the <unk> , he was so annoying , he threw a cold Mac in my face .
in my two and a half years of <unk> , I was beaten twice a week .
I had always had this accident .
in fact , one in three American women has been a victim of domestic violence or a potential target , and according to a report that said there were 1,500 million child abuse every year .
so in fact , I &apos;m not alone .
back to my question : why am I staying ?
the answer is simple .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
and even though he pointed to my head with a gun @-@ <unk> , he pushed me to the chase , killing our dog , <unk> the keys on the freeway , and when I was preparing for the interview , I never thought of myself as a abuse of my own wife .
instead , I &apos;m a very strong woman in love with somebody who &apos;s suffering , and I am the only person in the world who can help to face the circumstances of my own pain .
the other question you all want to ask is , why didn &apos;t she leave ?
why didn &apos;t I flee ? I had a lot of opportunities .
for me , it &apos;s the most fatal questions that people have asked me about heartbreak and suffering , you can &apos;t understand , but only our own victims know how dangerous it is .
because the last step in domestic abuse was killing her .
over 70 percent of domestic violence , 70 percent of the domestic violence , after the victim ended , was dying because the victim was killed .
other possible results include long @-@ term tracking , or even <unk> , or even <unk> , or legal support , family court to threaten treating victims and her children .
now we still ask , why don &apos;t she flee ?
and the reason I decided to leave was because of the last brutal beating that I could afford .
and I realized that if I didn &apos;t resist , this young man that I loved would kill me .
so I broke my silence .
and I asked everybody : police , neighbors , my friends and family , totally strange people , and I can stand here today because each of you has helped me .
we tend to think of the victims as <unk> , <unk> , as the horrible title of the news .
why is she leaving ? &quot;
some people were actually saying , &quot; This is her own mistake , &quot; as if the victim was an intentional and <unk> of intent .
but after the book came out , a lot of men and women told me their stories , and they also wanted to tell people that they learned from what was going on , they started living their lives -- happy lives , mothers , mothers , mothers , mothers and mothers , as I now live in violent situations .
in fact , I &apos;m a typical domestic victim , a typical domestic warrior .
I got married with a very soft man , three children .
he built a black <unk> , he <unk> the van .
and I &apos;ll never have that again , always a mouth that says love has a gun in my body , pointed to my head .
you &apos;re probably thinking right now , wow , this is amazing , or , &quot; Wow , she &apos;s amazing , &quot; but in the process , I &apos;m actually talking about you .
I can assure you , there are now people who are listening to me who are suffering from abuse or being abused when you were a child .
torture could happen to your daughter , your best friends .
and I was able to end up with this crazy love story about breaking silence .
I &apos;m still losing my silence today .
this is how I help other victims , and my final request for you .
tell someone you &apos;ve heard today .
torture was only in silence .
you have the ability to stop domestic violence and just light @-@ up .
our victims need everyone .
we want each of you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
with your children , your colleagues , your friends and family , talk about this topic , taking over light .
help survivors reclaim this wonderful , cute self , and re @-@ invent myself .
finding the cure for domestic violence , the potential for victims , the path of security .
let &apos;s face it , make our beds , our dining room , our dining room and our family into the safe , peaceful oasis .
thank you .
when I was a child , I thought my country was the best in the world . and after a while , I learned a song called <unk> .
I felt proud .
in schools , we spend a lot of time learning history , but we never knew anything about the world outside , except for American , Korea and Japan .
and although I always wanted to think about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , all of a sudden .
when I was seven years old , I first witnessed public execution , but I thought I was living in North Korea .
my family was not poor . and for myself , I had no experience of hunger .
but one day in 1995 , my mom took a letter home from her colleagues .
it says , &quot; When you read this letter , all five of my family would leave behind because we hadn &apos;t eaten for two weeks .
we &apos;re lying on the floor , and our bodies are so robust , ready to die . &quot;
and I was shocked .
that was the first time when I heard what people were in my country .
and shortly after this , when I was walking through a train station , I saw something very painful and very painful .
a dying woman was lying on the ground , holding a sick child , and the child was desperate to hold his mother &apos;s face .
but nobody helped them , because you couldn &apos;t afford to hang their families .
North Korea had a terrible famine .
unfortunately , over a million North Koreans died in famine , and many of the survivors were eating grass , <unk> and <unk> .
the power was going to get more and more and more frequently , at night , everything around me was going to be pitch black , except in China , and just through my own river .
I often wonder why they have <unk> and we don &apos;t .
this is a satellite photograph of North Korea and <unk> at night .
this is <unk> , part of the border as China and North Korea .
as you can see , the river is very , very narrow , and then , in some places , it &apos;s very narrow , it &apos;s accessible to the south .
but a lot of people died .
sometimes I see the body in the water .
I couldn &apos;t disclose all the details that I had left North Korea , but I could only say that was the most difficult years in famine , I was brought to China and my cousins .
and I thought , I was just separated from my family for a very short time .
but I hadn &apos;t thought about it , and we were there for 14 years .
in China , I was struggling as a little girl .
I had no idea what it would be like to be a refugee camp for the future of North Korea , but I quickly realized that it was a very difficult life , not only because North Korea , where they were perceived as illegal immigrants .
so I was always living in fear , and I was afraid that my identity was going to be discovered , and I would send it back to North Korea , and I would suffer the melancholic destiny .
one day , my worst nightmare came true , and I was grabbed by the Chinese police and taken them to the police station .
I was an officer of North Koreans , and so the cop tested my Mandarin skills , and asked me a lot of questions .
I was very afraid , and I felt that my heart was going berserk by the fear .
if I had any <unk> , I would go to prison and send it back .
I thought I &apos;d finished my life , but still trying to hide my own fear and anxiety and answering their questions .
after this , a cop says to another person , &quot; paper is wrong .
she &apos;s not North Koreans . &quot;
and they let me go . it &apos;s a miracle .
some North Koreans were seeking asylum in China to the foreign embassy , but many of them were arrested by the Chinese police , sent back to North Korea .
these girls were lucky .
and despite the fact that they were caught , there were huge international <unk> that they were ultimately released .
but a few North Koreans did not have that lucky .
every year , hundreds of thousands of North Koreans were arrested in China and sent them back to Korea , and they were incarcerated or executed .
although I was lucky enough to leave North Korea , a lot of my people didn &apos;t have that good luck .
it &apos;s a very tragic fact , and that &apos;s that North Koreans have to bear on the ground in order to survive .
even though they &apos;ve learned to do it , they &apos;ve found jobs , and the whole world is <unk> .
that &apos;s why , after 10 years of age , I decided to take risks to Korea , and that &apos;s why I started a new life .
it was a lot more difficult than I could think of it .
English is so important in Korea , so I had to start learning the third door -- English .
moreover , I realized there was a huge difference between Korea and North Korea .
even though we were all alone , our internal injuries became very different , because of the <unk> divided .
I even experienced a self @-@ questioning .
are I Korea or North Koreans ?
where do I come from ? who am I ?
and all of a sudden , I didn &apos;t seem to be able to call any country for myself .
I still decided that I was not comfortable with South Korea .
go to university .
and shortly after I started getting used to this new life , I got an incredible telephone .
the family stopped collecting parts of my life , as punishment , my family was forced to move , to a remote place .
they had to run away , so I started planning to get them out .
North Koreans have gone to freedom .
it &apos;s almost impossible to go across Korea and to a border in Korea , so , ironically , I flew to China and then to the border .
because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , so I had to help them go through the <unk> , into Southeast Asia .
we had a week on the bus , and a few of them were caught .
and again , the bus that we sat in was replaced by a Chinese officer .
he looked at everybody &apos;s ID card , and he started asking questions .
because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , I feared they would be caught .
so when the Chinese officer quickly went to my house , my instincts came to tell him that this was a <unk> , and I was their <unk> .
he looked at me , but fortunately , he believed me .
so we went all the way to <unk> , but I was going to spend almost all of my light savings on foreign border police .
and even though we had <unk> , my family and I was arrested in prison .
after spending my life on the fine and the bribe , my family was released after a month , but very soon , they were caught in the capital capital capital of Ontario .
that was one of the lowest moments in my life .
I wanted my family to be free , and I was able to get the best I could get out of prison when I was almost successful , and my family had to go to jail and not far from North Korea .
I was in the <unk> and the police department , busy <unk> a lot , desperately trying to save them , and I hadn &apos;t had enough money to pay for the bribe or the fine .
I couldn &apos;t believe .
and at this point , I heard a guy asking me , &quot; What ? &quot;
and I was shocked by this idea of a completely strangers asking .
I have a really bad English with a dictionary , and I have a little bit of an explanation for that person , and that guy goes to the ATM machine , and she buys all the rest of the country .
and I really appreciate him , and I said , &quot; Why would you help me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m the people in North Korea . &quot;
and I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life .
that good stranger was a symbol of mine and North Koreans , and he made me realize that strangers , kindness and international support , really our hope for North Koreans .
and eventually , after a long trip , I and my family were there in Korea , but only half of the freedom was not allowed to be there .
many North Koreans have separated from their families , and when they come to new countries , they usually have very little money , or sometimes very little homes .
so we can train education , English training , job training , and so on .
we can also bridge the gap between the people living in North Korea , because a lot of us are living in touch with families in North Korea , and the information and the money that we have moved to North Korea .
and I was so lucky that in my life , I was able to help and help , so I wanted to help in North Koreans , in an international aid , an opportunity to dream a dream .
I &apos;m confident that you will see more and more North Koreans in the world &apos;s stage , including TED .
thank you .
you might agree that that &apos;s a pretty good way .
it &apos;s the asphalt , the tar sands are a great material , driving on top of it , but not always , especially when it &apos;s the weather today , the rain .
a lot of water was spilled on <unk> .
in particular , if you &apos;re riding a bicycle with the car , it &apos;s not very nice .
and at the same time , the wind will generate a lot of noise .
it &apos;s a little bit noisy , and if we &apos;re going to build our roads , like the Dutch road , we &apos;re going to want a little bit of noise .
the solution is to use tar sands .
it &apos;s porous , and it uses most of the highways of the Dutch , and it has little pores to the water , and it goes to the road , and it &apos;s easy , it has no <unk> .
noise disappears into these pores .
because it has a lot of empty , and it <unk> the noise , so the road is silent .
and of course , there &apos;s <unk> , and the downside of this road is that the tar sands might be <unk> .
what &apos;s called the <unk> ? look at the rock off the road .
and then I started off , and then I got more and more , and then -- I couldn &apos;t demonstrate .
but they damage your windshield otherwise , you &apos;re not happy .
and in the end , there &apos;s a growing increase of damage .
sometimes the road is available .
ah , he was ready .
and it &apos;s going to be a problem , but we have a solution .
what you see here is the damage of this material .
this is the tar sands , as I said , and there are a few hairs in the middle .
and the reason that <unk> , ultraviolet , or <unk> , is this glue , this tar @-@ like , is shrinking , and the <unk> between the sugar , and if it contract , then you start to see the <unk> .
if you &apos;re driving along this way , you &apos;re going to see these <unk> -- that &apos;s what we see .
to address that , we looked at self @-@ cleaning materials .
if we can make this material self @-@ repair , there might be a solution .
and what we did was , we used the steel workers , the steel workers , the steel workers , the steel workers , the steel towers , the little bits , and we <unk> those .
so now the tar sands have some <unk> inside .
you need a machine like this , a reflection motor -- that can be used to cook .
sensing dexterity can heat things up , especially hot steel .
so what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to heat it up , melt the asphalt , melt it , and then exposing the little bits of the asphalt , and then off the bottom of the hill , and then get stuck .
because of the sensing that the motors got too high , I showed it in the <unk> .
and the same principle of <unk> .
I put it in there , and now I can take it and see what happens .
this is what it looks like today .
we have four billion machines in our lab to heat them .
we tested lots of samples , and the government saw our results , and they decided , &quot; This is interesting , we should try . &quot;
the government licensed a highway for us , 400 meters on <unk> , and we did the material testing there .
and this is what we did . what you see here is the city of the city , of course , it &apos;s not going to be bad for years . we identified that .
we took a lot of samples in the lab .
so we did this aging experiment , and we added a lot of these <unk> , using our sensors to heat them up , heating and test them .
we can do that .
in fact , the conclusion of this experiment was that if we had our heating machine every four years on this freeway -- the <unk> , we had to move this machine to the side of the road -- we had twice as much as the road , of course , on the road .
so , the conclusion is that we &apos;ve created a kind of material , we &apos;ve added a little bit of energy , we &apos;ve added a lot of road rage , we &apos;ve doubled the longevity of the road , and we &apos;ve got a lot of money using this simple technique .
you wonder if it works .
we looked at this prototype . it &apos;s a little hot .
in fact , I &apos;m going to let it cool off to show you if heated works .
but try .
see , actually , fix it .
thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
four million birds on Earth .
<unk> is one of their most endangered species .
and when you see that the grass is like this , the first thing that comes to mind is that it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> , it &apos;s a terrible creature that <unk> and it &apos;s a great way of talking to politicians .
I want to change that . I want to change the way you think about it , because they need our compassion . they really need it .
let me tell you why .
first of all , why do they leave us alone with this ?
Charles Darwin , in the flight of the Atlantic Ocean , discovered over the course of January , when he said , &quot; These small boats , the birds of the hairs on the expedition , the birds of the <unk> , were always filled with <unk> from the <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s hard to find more harmful than this one , which Charles Darwin said .
you know , Darwin went back to England and changed his perspective , and I &apos;m going to tell you why .
and Walt Whitman also had been seen from Walt Whitman -- <unk> , personality @-@ like dogs , personality @-@ style , <unk> .
and lately , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to the news of Kenya -- Kenya , members of Kenya are blessed to be <unk> and <unk> .
I want to question it . you know why ?
because legislators can &apos;t keep the environment clean .
you can &apos;t stop transmission of disease .
almost no one &apos;s been following a day .
they &apos;re very far from extinction .
and that &apos;s my favorite , that better than the legislators have .
there are four billion people in the world .
the New World Trade Center grew primarily in the Americas , in the Americas , in the Americas , in Venezuela , and in the entire continent there were 16 species of trees , and they had the risk of dying .
so why is this important ? well , first of all , the ecological cycles are important for the living . they &apos;re very poor .
<unk> is our natural waste .
they would have leaf @-@ eating properties .
they were able to eliminate all the bacteria on the body , and they were able to absorb the transmission of the virus from the virus to the spread of the virus and the animals that were far away from death and disease .
the recent study also showed that in places that hadn &apos;t been reclaimed from the river to three to four times , the spread of the disease and spread more opportunities .
there &apos;s a lot of historical information .
they had a deep connection with the ancient Egypt .
the culture of the <unk> civilization is a symbol of <unk> and <unk> , usually along with the <unk> rings , with the <unk> of Egypt and Egypt .
in the Islamic myth , <unk> <unk> , he risked his life from 10 evil spirits <unk> out in his hand .
and in Tibet , the culture of <unk> is particularly important , in places like Tibet , where there are no <unk> , there are no trees , there are no trees , there are no wood to be transported to the indigenous people .
so what &apos;s the problem with all of this ?
Kenya grows in eight <unk> , and six of them are dying .
many of the reasons why conservation has been displaced , toxins are because in Kenya , humans and wildlife are fighting poison and they use poison to treat animals , and then they become the next victim .
in South Asia , there are countries like India and Pakistan , and there are four species that have become endangered , and that means that within 10 to 15 years or 15 years , the reason why they &apos;re completely extinct is because of the <unk> acid , which has been fed into genetically engineered by <unk> acid , which means <unk> .
now , there &apos;s been a ban on <unk> acid in India , and the government of India has done a positive job .
and because of the <unk> of the <unk> , the wild cats that started <unk> around the animal , the wild cats that <unk> in the wild , and they &apos;re going to explode every single time , and the number of cases that happened in India is staggering .
Kenya is going to have the largest wind farm in Africa : wind farms that are going to be installed in <unk> .
I &apos;m not against developing wind , but we should invite the government to rethink the decision , because wind will pose a threat to birds , and high doses of the birds in half .
they &apos;re just birds .
in West Africa , there are people who have no sense of compassion and <unk> to meet the needs of <unk> and <unk> .
what are we doing ? we &apos;re looking at these markers . we &apos;re putting them on top of them .
we &apos;re trying to figure out what the relationship is and what &apos;s going on .
we found that they travel between different countries , so if you &apos;re just looking at an area , you &apos;re really hard to make progress .
we need to work with governments around the world .
we &apos;re trying to communicate with local people .
we &apos;re trying to get them to the benefits of good quality , and to appreciate the amazing creatures and their contribution to nature .
what can you do ? you can do it , make an <unk> , you can write your government and tell them , we need to focus on those organisms that are <unk> , and just take a moment to tell you who you are .
and when you walk out of this room , you &apos;re <unk> , not only to tell your family , but to tell your neighbor about their neighbors .
they were so elegant . and Charles Darwin once said that he had changed his mind , and he saw that both the peoples in the air were <unk> and beginning to rest .
Kenya , all over the world , there &apos;s going to be a big loss if you lose all these wonderful species .
thank you very much .
people around us can help us to make our lives a better place .
we don &apos;t necessarily have to meet our neighbors all the time , so even though we live in a public space , we don &apos;t have the wisdom of our neighbors .
so in the last few years , I &apos;ve been trying to give stickers , different ones , different ones , different pieces , and these simple tools , to share more of them in public spaces .
and these projects came from some of my own questions , like , how much does my neighbor rent ?
how are we going to be able to take something from the neighborhood and avoid <unk> off the door ?
how can we share our own memories of being destroyed and understand the land that we live in ?
how do we express our expectations and our dreams of what we have here ?
I live in New Orleans and fell in love with the city .
the great tar sands have always touched my soul for hundreds of years , couples and <unk> , and people always believe that this is a city full of music .
I felt like a New Orleans when someone was thinking of well @-@ attended .
New Orleans had the most beautiful buildings in the world , but at the same time , she was the most abandoned city in America .
and I live in this neighborhood , and I wanted to see how I could make it a better place in this community and think about something else , and it changed my life completely .
in 2009 , I lost one of my loved ones .
her name was <unk> , and to me , she was like my mother , and she was dead so suddenly that no one had ever anticipated .
and then I thought about a lot of things about death , and then -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this is what makes me feel real about my time , with the woman , with the woman , with the woman , with the woman who has it .
but I was hard to maintain this mentality in my daily life .
I think people are so easy to forget what &apos;s really important .
and I was able to take this part of the wall out of some of the neighborhoods and turn it into a giant blackboard , and I put them on the same line , and before they die , I thought , &quot; Well , everybody who by the way would pick up a piece of chalk and leave their life in a public .
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , the whole wall was filled with , and there was a new answer .
I want to share with you some of the things that people have on the wall .
before I die , I want to take a trial for my release .
before I die , I want to cross .
before I die , I want to sing in front of a million people . &quot;
before we die , we have a tree .
before I die , I wanted to live a <unk> .
before I die , I want to hold her again . &quot;
before I die , I wanted to be a man .
before I die , I want to be fully true .
this was a place where the unexpected architecture of the building had become a very constructive place , where the hopes and dreams made me smile and laughing and <unk> and gave me comfort .
it makes us believe that we are not alone .
let &apos;s take a new paradigm of inspiration for our neighbors .
and this opens up a space of reflection and thought , and it also reminds us that what is important in the process of changing .
this is what I did last year , and I was getting this message from people who were passionate about me , and I wanted to put a wall in their community , and so my colleagues and I made a small toolbox , and now this wall is all over the world , so Australia , and so on .
and the signs are that , if we have an ability to express our will and share it with others , then public spaces play a huge role .
the most precious and most precious of all , the two things that we have , the time and the connection to each other .
in the midst of this incredible period of time , trying to maintain the self , to remember the life of life , to make it more important than ever before .
we always talk about dying and about dying and about dying , but I realized that being one of the most powerful things we could do to death .
think about death , making you more conscious of your own life .
public spaces can be much more important for us , both for individuals , for the community , for the community , to share our hopes , our fears , our experiences , our experiences , to help us create a better place for us .
thank you .
thank you .
I was in a coal mine in 50 meters deep in Ghana .
the air is hot , filled with dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I could feel the warmth of a <unk> from people around me , but I couldn &apos;t see anything else .
I heard people talking to each other , but more of them were silent rocks with soft tools .
like everyone else , I had a <unk> knife on my head with a beat @-@ up @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ bag truck tied to my neck , <unk> through the branches of the wall , and they held this meter @-@ long <unk> suit .
and my hand got over , and immediately came to a miner who I met in a miner who had fallen off his hand and knocked on the door .
when I stand here today with you today , the miners who are still in mine like this , there &apos;s no pay , there &apos;s no subsidies .
and I ended up walking out of mines and going home to the miners who never came home .
I &apos;ve spent the last 28 years photographing domestic cultural films in the last 28 continents , and in 2009 , I &apos;ve been very privileged to be able to go to a place called <unk> at the Vancouver Summit .
there were a lot of people I met , a lot of them , and I met this guy who was one of the <unk> <unk> , an organization that was founded to eradicate the modern world .
we talked about slavery , and this is where I really started to understand the reality of slavery , even though I &apos;ve always known about the world of slavery , but I don &apos;t know what it is .
after we had a conversation , I felt really bad , and I felt ashamed of this <unk> thing , and I didn &apos;t know , how many people did it ?
and this led me to a couple of weeks later , I flew to Los Angeles to see the head of &quot; <unk> , &quot; to make a difference .
and that led me to the journey of slavery .
oddly enough , I &apos;ve been there .
and I also think of them as my second home .
but this time , I was going to find the secret to see if I could not .
according to the fact that there are more than 27 million people around the world today .
this number is twice the number of trade @-@ off trade @-@ off trade in the Atlantic slave trade in Africa .
150 years ago , the price of a department store was three times as much an American business as a whole .
that &apos;s 50,000 dollars today .
but today , the price of life @-@ saving slavery could be something like 18 dollars .
and what was striking was that the revenue of the global commons was over 130 billion dollars a year .
many of them have been given a false commitment to what &apos;s called an education opportunity , a good job , for free to work against violence , without getting away .
today , it &apos;s a market @-@ based product of slavery , and it &apos;s a value @-@ based product , but it &apos;s a combination of people who are released by the individuals .
it exists in virtually every corner of the world , even though it &apos;s illegal everywhere .
in India and Nepal , I was brought to <unk> .
it was a very strange sight , like walking into the ancient Egypt or the <unk> .
men , women , children , in the heat of 50 years , are literally hundreds of thousands of tons of dust , put bricks on their own heads , beating 18 blocks to a few hundred meters away .
<unk> and <unk> were hanging , and they were quiet , they were doing the same thing over and over again , 16 to 17 hours a day .
you can &apos;t take a break , you can &apos;t eat , you can &apos;t drink it because of extreme water , and they don &apos;t need a toilet .
and because of that heat and dust , my camera <unk> couldn &apos;t work .
every 20 minutes , I had to go back to the vehicle and clean up my equipment and make it pause under the air conditioning and give it a pause for me to sit on the vehicle , and the camera is much better than the human being .
and I went back to <unk> , and I wanted to cry , but the <unk> that came next to me quickly settled , and he said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t cry here . &quot;
and then he explained to me that when I was in this place , it was very dangerous , not only for me , but for the workers .
I couldn &apos;t give them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money . I couldn &apos;t give them anything .
I &apos;m not the citizen of that country .
my behavior might make them worse than now .
I was expecting the Free <unk> to be able to work within the system , to show them that they can .
and for me , I had to wait for my family to taste that painful .
in the meantime , I &apos;ve seen kids doing these rocks for a couple of miles , right next to a truck waiting for trucks .
the kids who beat up the plates , they carry the kids with the sticks , with the toys , with the dishes .
it &apos;s a terrible thing to see .
how can we intervene in these hidden arguments , but what are the ingredients that are universal ?
some people don &apos;t even think that they &apos;re on a daily basis for <unk> , and that &apos;s because they &apos;re born with these things .
no comparison .
if those people were to fight for their own people , they would burn all the houses .
these people had nothing to do , they were scared , they wanted to give up , but in the middle of the photo , the women shared a lot of money , working with the local <unk> , and now they were doing it for themselves , and they were free .
and the reason why I remember this is that most of us , when we hear about slavery , is because you know , around the world , I was warn you , if I insisted on this , the industry is not going to be safe .
in Ontario , I was struck by some women who had been there .
they took me down the narrow stairs and they went into a filthy basement .
this is not a <unk> .
it &apos;s more like a restaurant .
the balconies have to be used to be used to be used to force prostitution .
in little cubicle , sexuality women and children are only seven years old to please their clients .
each chamber is very dirty , and the walls are filled with numbers from curtains or curtains .
people who work in this room tend to abuse their own cruel sexual abuse .
remember , I was standing in the middle of a dark , and I was immediately terrified of the fear that I was trying to get stuck in this hell .
there &apos;s only one <unk> : the staircase .
there was no answered .
no one &apos;s window .
these people were completely unable to escape , and when we were confronted with this difficult topic , it &apos;s important to know about slavery , including <unk> in our backyard .
there are literally thousands of restaurants , and there are hundreds of thousands of these .
recently , the New York Times has reported that every year between 100,000 and 200,000 children have been bought and traded .
and we just don &apos;t know that .
and that &apos;s when we hear about slavery .
I visited a village <unk> in India .
this is the portrait of a family .
the hands of those blue and red were held by two sons .
and they &apos;re deposited in a stained glass , and they &apos;re putting the silk through it , and then they &apos;re putting it in an arm that &apos;s poisonous .
and the translator told me their stories .
we don &apos;t have freedom . they say .
but we still hope , God forbid , from this room to elsewhere , to get paid .
it &apos;s been estimated that more than 4,000 children in the peel of Walt Whitman , were the largest fish in the world .
we were there , and I went to see this .
I see it as if it was a family with two brothers and a couple of little dots , like ?
wrong . they &apos;re slave slaves .
kids are sold out from their homes , and they &apos;re placed on boats that don &apos;t work , and they don &apos;t even swim .
this little boy is eight years old .
and as our boat approached him , he was shaking on the island of <unk> his canoe .
he was afraid to fall in the water .
and the branches of the trees that run around , often , are packed in the net , and the ones that are tired , the ones that get thrown in the water , tend to check the net .
a lot of people are drowning .
and it was forced to start a job as a child .
he was very afraid to run away , because he was treated as a child , and he was treated with the same kind of slavery .
I saw boys at 5 o &apos;clock in the morning working in a net , and they started working in the morning .
it was so cold , it was so cold .
you know , when the nets fill in the fish , they weigh it .
I want to introduce you to the <unk> .
he got out of a fishing village .
he saw him in a safe house , and the World Trade Center for <unk> victims .
he was in a pool of shelter , and the good news is that right now , the quality of the family is more than the family , and one of them is ready to make a living and make sure that the child is safe .
there &apos;s a possibility .
because somebody shows up a position , it can change his future .
driving on a pathway in Ghana , with a partner with the <unk> , a steel ring with a steel ring on the <unk> of Ghana , blowing up our vehicle .
and he asked us to take a <unk> and change it .
at the end of the road , he urged us to quit driving .
and then he pointed to a series of distinct footprints that said , &quot; Here , this is the road . walk ! &quot;
and we were dragging around all the fresh fruit for about an hour , and a very recent amount of rain stopped , and I was dragging around my chest and drinking water from my chest .
and after two hours of <unk> <unk> , we had a huge <unk> in the parking lot in front of us .
a lot of women are still carrying their own children , and they &apos;re walking in a coal @-@ fired dirty water .
mercury is for extracting gold .
these people were slavery in another mine in Ghana .
when they got out of the mines , they were full of water .
I remember that they were full of tired eyes , and a lot of them were working in 72 hours .
these rocks are about 90 feet deep , and they &apos;re packed with bags full of rocks , and these rocks are transported to another area , and they &apos;re grabbing .
and the man who ran it against it was robust , but we found that there were teams of people on the edges , and there were children .
they were victims of nasty violence .
in fact , the men of these muscles , for the next couple of years , were probably as likely to suffer from this guy as a <unk> and tuberculosis .
this is <unk> . when his father died , his uncle sold him to the mining of his work .
and when his uncle dies , he continues to carry on with his uncle &apos;s <unk> , and he is forced to work on mining .
and I met him who had been working on the mining industry for 14 years , and this photograph was actually caused by an accident , and the doctors said , &quot; There &apos;s an arm . &quot;
apart from this injury , he had tuberculosis , and he had to do it every day .
and even so , he dreamed of <unk> , and then he was able to educate himself on the Red Sea , which is an example of an incredible amount of suffering .
I want us to give these people the slaves .
when I was photographing this , I took a lot of candles , I gave them my photographs , and I wanted to be able to light their stories and their failures , and when we were all safe , I took this series of photographs .
they know these images will be seen by people outside .
I want them to know that we &apos;re going to change their lives in the Senate .
and I do believe that when we think of them as people , it &apos;s very difficult to <unk> the atrocities of slavery .
these images aren &apos;t about issues , they &apos;re about people , and they &apos;re about people , like me , deserve the same rights , dignity and respect for life .
I didn &apos;t want these beautiful , but I was treated by people who were not violent .
I want these images to be able to evoke a powerful force in the eye of the eye , and I hope that the <unk> of this force will be the light of slavery , because without the light , this light will continue to live in a shadow .
thank you .
I &apos;m a very special problem for everyone who studies mathematics , and there &apos;s a special problem for math , which is that we have a lot like management consultants .
nobody knows what we are .
so I &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we &apos;re doing today .
well , dance is one of the many activities of mankind .
we &apos;re a dancer , a <unk> , and you &apos;ll know later .
now ballet needs extraordinary expertise and incredible expertise and even some level @-@ level <unk> .
but sadly , the nervous system disease , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease , destroyed this extraordinary ability for his friends , <unk> , was a great mentor for him .
and for those years , he had a lot of therapy and a lot of progress .
and yet , there are <unk> million people in the world who suffer from this disease , and they have to endure , <unk> , <unk> and so on , and so we need objective tools to test them before we get to the test .
we need objective measurements , and finally , we want to know when , the only way to get a cure is when we have an objective answer to those questions .
but it &apos;s annoying . it &apos;s Parkinson &apos;s disease , and it &apos;s not biologically cancer , so you can &apos;t do simple blood tests , and the best thing we can do is , like , a 20 @-@ minute neuroscience .
you &apos;ve got to get clinics , and it costs a lot of money , which means no one &apos;s ever done this before .
but what if the patient could do it at home ?
what if the patient was able to do this test for the patient ?
it doesn &apos;t take a lot of money to hire people .
by the way , if you go to a neurologist , it costs about 300 dollars .
so I &apos;d like to propose an alternative approach to you , an approach that we can try to achieve , because you know , in a sense , at least we &apos;re all like my friend <unk> .
I have a video about <unk> <unk> .
this is someone in a healthy state , and we think of ourselves as the voice of the voice , because when we make these sounds , we have to deal with those <unk> , which are , indeed , born with genes , like <unk> .
and like ballet , it needs to be trained in particular .
think about it . how long would it take ?
in sound , we can follow the positions of <unk> , as in the Parkinson &apos;s , and it can affect our feet .
you can see that the <unk> on the bottom is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we saw the same symptoms .
voices , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
the talk will become loud , and there will be more sound , and these are examples of symptoms .
in fact , the sound of most of the sound is elusive , but as long as you have a digital microphone , you have a sophisticated voice analysis of the software , you combine it with a very modern machine learning , and now we can get to the point where people are healthy and disease , which is just a signal .
so what do they do with speech @-@ based testing , and what do they do with specialized clinical trials , actually ?
the neurological testing is <unk> , and they use existing infrastructure .
you don &apos;t have to design a series of new hospitals to test it .
they &apos;re all <unk> . they &apos;re all based on speech tests , but they &apos;re not experts at all .
that means you can do it yourself .
and it &apos;s going fast , and it &apos;s going to be 30 seconds .
the price was low , and we knew how to do it .
and once it &apos;s released , it can be scaled up massively .
I &apos;ve got some great goals out here .
we can reduce the number of questions with patients .
there &apos;s no need to go to the clinic and do routine tests .
we can monitor objective data by simply discovering .
we can organize the clinical trials with a lot of radiation , and we can also show the scale of the people .
we also had the opportunity to start looking for this disease in the early days of <unk> .
so , starting from this point of view , the very first step , we started <unk> &apos;s <unk> project .
and with <unk> and <unk> , we would like to record a lot of data from all over the world to get to these four goals .
our total number connected to seven million people on the planet .
anyone who has a health or a Parkinson &apos;s disease can come in , it &apos;s cheap , it &apos;s cheap to leave the record , and I &apos;m glad to say that we &apos;re only at eight hours , we &apos;re at six percent .
thank you .
Max , based on these samples , let &apos;s say , who is the case of the person who is healthy , who is the disease ?
what do you want to take from those specimens ?
yes , yes . so this is what you have to tell us if you have this disease .
you know , some people might not be calling us or connected .
but we still get samples from lots of different environments , and the point is that different environments , because then we can eliminate the causes of these kinds of <unk> to really try to get this disease .
so you &apos;ve got about 86 percent accuracy right now ?
it &apos;s gone .
as a matter of fact , my student <unk> , I have to mention that he &apos;s doing some pretty good work , and now he &apos;s proven that the mobile phone will be able to do this project online , so we &apos;re now approaching 99 percent of the precision .
okay , that &apos;s great .
so it also means that people can -- -- people can use your mobile phone to call you in your phone , and then do this test , and then they can get on the phone , and then they can record the voice , and then they can check out what they &apos;re doing in the phase of the disease .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much , Max and all of us .
thank you .
I &apos;ve been very interested in filming photography since I &apos;ve been working with enough cameras , but I &apos;d like to share with you 15 pictures of what I really like to do today .
there &apos;s no artistic director , there &apos;s no open space , there &apos;s no opportunity , let &apos;s forget .
in fact , most of them were taken by random visitors .
one of my stories was written in New York at a time when I was offered a prize in New York City , and my wife took a picture , and I was on her third birthday , and we were on the cusp of 57 Boulevard and <unk> .
and a year later , we went back to New York City , so we decided to take a picture of the same .
you can guess what happened .
and when my daughter was three , her wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you ever call back in New York ? do you want to continue this little tradition ? &quot;
and that &apos;s when we started taking pictures of people on our way .
you know , taking the camera and hands it to a total stranger is common and unusual .
no one &apos;s going to refuse , and fortunately no one &apos;s going to take our cameras out .
at that time , we didn &apos;t know it would change our lives deeply .
it became sacred to us .
this was taken just a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and I was trying to explain what was going on that day 9 / 11 trying to figure out the way that this five @-@ year @-@ olds understood .
so these pictures are far more than just documenting a moment , or a very specific journey .
they &apos;re one of the ways we can remember the 10 @-@ month @-@ olds , and let &apos;s think about what we &apos;ve been spending years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years .
because I photographed the same photographs every year , our views were different , and my daughter got to a new milestone , and I watched through her eyes and see how she reacted , and how she saw everything .
it &apos;s the time we spent our time with it , the most anticipated time in a year .
recently , we were walking along the way , and she stopped , and she pointed to the red shoe store and she said she loved her baby .
she told me when she was five years old , and she stood on that photo .
she said she remembers the first time she saw her heart emerging , and that was nine years ago .
now she went to New York to look at college campuses , because she decided to go to New York .
and I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is our memories .
so I want to share with you this idea of actively creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but I personally , I personally , I don &apos;t have the usual suspects in my family .
I always took the photo .
I would like to encourage all of you in this room to go out into the photo , don &apos;t you know , go up to the front lines , go , &quot; Can you take pictures ? &quot;
thank you .
