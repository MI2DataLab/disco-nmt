one day , Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez was walking along the streets of downtown Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an African @-@ American man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
and I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because Steve &apos;s columns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez , and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers , the Juilliard @-@ trained double bassist whose promising career was cut short by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia .
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and 30 years later he was living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to read Steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instrumental -- if you &apos;ll pardon the pun -- in helping Nathaniel get off the streets .
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008 , two years ago , at Walt Disney Concert Hall .
he had just heard a performance of Beethoven &apos;s First and Fourth symphonies , and came backstage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way about Yo @-@ Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series , all because of the treacherous first violin passage work in the last movement of Beethoven &apos;s Fourth Symphony .
and we got talking about music , and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is prone to these schizophrenic episodes , the worst of which can manifest themselves as him exploding and then disappearing for days , wandering the streets of Skid Row , exposed to its horrors , with the torment of his own mind unleashed upon him .
and Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall -- he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
and I was afraid , not for myself , but I was afraid that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sink into one of his states , and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin if I started talking about scales and arpeggios and other exciting forms of didactic violin pedagogy .
so , I just started playing .
and I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto .
and as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occurring in Nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst .
and Nathaniel &apos;s manic rage was transformed into understanding , a quiet curiosity and grace .
and in a miracle , he lifted his own violin and he started playing , by ear , certain snippets of violin concertos which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn , Tchaikovsky , Sibelius .
and we started talking about music , from Bach to Beethoven and Brahms , Bruckner , all the B &apos;s , from Bart√≥k , all the way up to Esa @-@ Pekka Salonen .
and I understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man had transformed from the paranoid , disturbed man that had just come from walking the streets of downtown Los Angeles to the charming , erudite , brilliant , Juilliard @-@ trained musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for Nathaniel , music is sanity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an escape from his tormented state .
and I understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
and for Nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the redemptive power of music brought him back into a family of musicians that understood him , that recognized his talents and respected him .
and I will always make music with Nathaniel , whether we &apos;re at Walt Disney Concert Hall or on Skid Row , because he reminds me why I became a musician .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : thank you . thanks .
Robert Gupta .
Robert Gupta : I &apos;m going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists .
so , please forgive me .
so , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
it was a beautiful fish : flavorful , textured , meaty , a bestseller on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , it was farm @-@ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustainability .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; I said .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this unimaginable problem for us chefs : how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the seas like we clear @-@ cut forests .
it &apos;s hard to overstate the destruction .
ninety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tunas , the halibuts , the salmons , swordfish -- they &apos;ve collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aquaculture , fish farming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of arguments against it : fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re inefficient . take tuna , a major drawback .
it &apos;s got a feed conversion ratio of 15 to one .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
the day before the event , I called the head of P.R. for the company .
let &apos;s call him Don .
&quot; don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world unto ourselves .
that feed conversion ratio ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; I said . got off the phone .
and that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , I got on the phone with the head biologist .
let &apos;s call him Don too .
&quot; don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algaes and some fish meals , and then he said chicken pellets .
I said , &quot; Chicken pellets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Yeah , feathers , skin , bone meal , scraps , dried and processed into feed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
I fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because I &apos;m some self @-@ righteous , goody @-@ two shoes foodie .
I actually am .
no , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I swear to God , after that conversation , the fish tasted like chicken .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a restaurant in southern Spain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
the chef had overcooked it .
like twice over .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been overcooked ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him Miguel -- actually his name is Miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and I understand it .
he &apos;s a biologist at Veta La Palma .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain .
it &apos;s at the tip of the Guadalquivir river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians .
they raised beef cattle on what was essentially wetlands .
they did it by draining the land .
they built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not economically .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land .
what did they do ?
they reversed the flow of water .
they literally flipped the switch .
instead of pushing water out , they used the channels to pull water back in .
they flooded the canals .
they created a 27,000 @-@ acre fish farm -- bass , mullet , shrimp , eel -- and in the process , Miguel and this company completely reversed the ecological destruction .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
you stare out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are flooded canals and this thick , rich marshland .
I was there not long ago with Miguel .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee .
okay ? there we are slogging through the wetlands , and I &apos;m panting and sweating , got mud up to my knees , and Miguel &apos;s calmly conducting a biology lecture .
here , he &apos;s pointing out a rare Black @-@ shouldered Kite .
now , he &apos;s mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the Tanzanian giraffe .
it turns out , Miguel spent the better part of his career in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
he said , &quot; Fish ? I didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then he &apos;s off , launching into more talk about rare birds and algaes and strange aquatic plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the biotic community unplugged , kind of thing .
it &apos;s great , but I was in love .
and my head was swooning over that overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before .
so I interrupted him . I said , &quot; Miguel , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
he pointed at the algae .
&quot; I know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what &apos;s the feed conversion ratio ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it &apos;s what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self @-@ renewing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
later that day , I was driving around this property with Miguel , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm I &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at their bellies , pink .
they &apos;re feasting . &quot;
Feasting ? I was totally confused .
I said , &quot; Miguel , aren &apos;t they feasting on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to birds .
well , last year , this property had 600,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; Miguel , isn &apos;t a thriving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; We farm extensively , not intensively .
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the Pinker the belly , the better the system . &quot;
okay , so let &apos;s review : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
a fish farm , but also a bird sanctuary .
Oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
they brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of highway A92 .
no kidding .
I was imagining a &quot; March of the Penguins &quot; thing , so I looked at Miguel .
I said , &quot; Miguel , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song .
he said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious -- and I don &apos;t like fish skin ; I don &apos;t like it seared , I don &apos;t like it crispy .
it &apos;s that acrid , tar @-@ like flavor .
I almost never cook with it .
yet , when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain , it tasted not at all like fish skin .
it tasted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
I mentioned that to Miguel , and he nodded .
he said , &quot; The skin acts like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before anything enters the body .
it evolved to soak up impurities . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; But our water has no impurities . &quot;
OK . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
and then I realized when he says , &quot; A farm that has no impurities , &quot; he made a big understatement , because the water that flows through that farm comes in from the Guadalquivir River .
it &apos;s a river that carries with it all the things that rivers tend to carry these days : chemical contaminants , pesticide runoff .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water purification plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water leaves , it dumps out into the Atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however romantic , is also instructive .
you might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bass or beef cattle .
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
we &apos;re not realists , us foodies ; we &apos;re lovers .
we love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family farms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ?
can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gross inequalities in distribution , not tonnage .
now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed grain to herbivores , pesticides to monocultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agribusiness has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re feeding more people more cheaply , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justification : it &apos;s been the business plan of American agriculture .
we should call it what it is : a business in liquidation , a business that &apos;s quickly eroding ecological capital that makes that very production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
our breadbasket is threatened today , not because of diminishing supply , but because of diminishing resources .
not by the latest combine and tractor invention , but by fertile land ; not by pumps , but by fresh water ; not by chainsaws , but by forests ; and not by fishing boats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better : how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agribusiness model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s tired .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look to the ecological model .
that &apos;s the one that relies on two billion years of on @-@ the @-@ job experience .
look to Miguel , farmers like Miguel .
farms that aren &apos;t worlds unto themselves ; farms that restore instead of deplete ; farms that farm extensively instead of just intensively ; farmers that are not just producers , but experts in relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
and if I &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than I &apos;ll ever be .
you know , I &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if I can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consume is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information overload , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality chart organized by age .
this tool that I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pivot , and with pivot what I can do is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say , accidents .
and , right away , I see there &apos;s a different pattern that emerges .
this is because , in the mid @-@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most frail .
we can step back out again and then reorganize the data by cause of death , seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we filter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you drill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that viewing information , viewing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information info @-@ graphic .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated ever produced .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with pivot , you can drill into a decade .
you can drill into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
so I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
I &apos;m a Lance Armstrong fan , so I &apos;ll go ahead and I &apos;ll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which Lance Armstrong &apos;s been a part of .
now , if I want to just kind of take a peek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cycling ? &quot;
so I can step back , and expand on that .
and I see Greg LeMond now .
and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way -- going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out -- you &apos;re not searching , you &apos;re not browsing .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single Wikipedia page and we reduced it down to a little summary .
so the summary consists of just a little synopsis and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from .
I &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to go ahead and select government .
now , having selected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categories that most frequently correspond to that are Time magazine People of the Year .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular summaries , I can then drill into the concept of Time magazine Person of the Year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , I can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sciences ; some , fewer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my boss -- and one has come from music .
and interestingly enough , Bono is also a TED Prize winner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the TED Prize winners .
so you see , we &apos;re navigating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from page @-@ to @-@ page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
and so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
I &apos;m just showing the New York Times website here .
so pivot , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoomable technology to every single web page like this .
so I can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , I can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way .
so I can drill into what I &apos;ve done over specific time frames .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that I just gave .
and I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today .
and , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can slice and dice my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , I was doing some nepotistic searching , looking for Bing , over here for Live Labs pivot .
and from these , I can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
it &apos;s one metaphor repurposed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
we talk about the curse of information overload .
we talk about drowning in data .
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being trapped in data , we might actually extract information .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
so with that , I thank you .
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
in high school , I took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and I was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had .
and you know , that curiosity also manifested itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woods , hiking and taking &quot; samples &quot; -- frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
you know , I was a real science geek .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
so , that seemed to resonate with the whole science fiction part of it .
and I was an artist .
I could draw . I could paint .
and I found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this saturation of CG movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author &apos;s description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
I was endlessly getting busted in math class doodling behind the textbook .
that was -- the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
and an interesting thing happened : the Jacques Cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday -- that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
but that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as rich and exotic as anything that I had imagined from reading these books .
so , I decided I was going to become a scuba diver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
but I didn &apos;t let that daunt me .
I pestered my father until he finally found a scuba class in Buffalo , New York , right across the border from where we live .
and I actually got certified in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter in Buffalo , New York .
and I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
since then , in the intervening 40 years , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in submersibles .
and I &apos;ve learned that that deep @-@ ocean environment , and even the shallow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination .
I still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what I see when I make these dives .
and my love affair with the ocean is ongoing , and just as strong as it ever was .
but when I chose a career as an adult , it was filmmaking .
and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge I had to tell stories with my urges to create images .
and I was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
so , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; Terminator , &quot; &quot; Aliens &quot; and &quot; The Abyss . &quot;
and with &quot; The Abyss , &quot; I was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking .
so , you know , merging the two passions .
something interesting came out of &quot; The Abyss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embraced computer generated animation , CG .
and this resulted in the first soft @-@ surface character , CG animation that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- barely broke even , I should say -- I witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic .
you know , it &apos;s Arthur Clarke &apos;s law that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .
they were seeing something magical .
and so that got me very excited .
and I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art . &quot;
so , with &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much farther .
working with ILM , we created the liquid metal dude in that film . the success hung in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , I started a company with Stan Winston , my good friend Stan Winston , who is the premier make @-@ up and creature designer at that time , and it was called Digital domain .
and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
but we found ourselves lagging in the mid &apos; 90s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually founded the company to do .
so , I wrote this piece called &quot; Avatar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelope of visual effects , of CG effects , beyond , with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG , and the main characters would all be in CG , and the world would be in CG .
and the envelope pushed back , and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so , I shelved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks .
you know , I went and pitched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; Romeo and Juliet &apos; on a ship : &quot; it &apos;s going to be this epic romance , passionate film . &quot;
secretly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to dive to the real wreck of &quot; Titanic . &quot;
and that &apos;s why I made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to dive to the wreck . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing hook . &quot;
and I talked them into funding an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Russian submersible two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic through a view port .
not a movie , not HD -- for real .
now , that blew my mind .
and it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it struck me how much this dive , these deep dives , was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
you get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
and I thought like , &quot; Wow . I &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
this is really cool . &quot;
and so , I really got bitten by the bug of deep @-@ ocean exploration .
of course , the curiosity , the science component of it -- it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
and it was an experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , I could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our subsequent expeditions , I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them .
so , I was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
and so , I actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of &quot; Titanic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie maker , and I &apos;m going to go be a full @-@ time explorer for a while . &quot;
and so , we started planning these expeditions .
and we wound up going to the Bismark , and exploring it with robotic vehicles .
we went back to the Titanic wreck .
we took little bots that we had created that spooled a fiber optic .
and the idea was to go in and do an interior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here I am now , on the deck of Titanic , sitting in a submersible , and looking out at planks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had played .
and I &apos;m flying a little robotic vehicle through the corridor of the ship .
when I say , &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
I felt like I was physically present inside the shipwreck of Titanic .
and it was the most surreal kind of deja vu experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually revealed it , because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the telepresence experience -- that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really , really quite profound .
and it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cyborg bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post @-@ human futures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
so , having done these expeditions , and really beginning to appreciate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean vents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically aliens right here on Earth .
they live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
they don &apos;t survive on sunlight @-@ based system the way we do .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 500 @-@ degree @-@ Centigrade water plumes .
you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
at the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fiction influence , as a kid .
and I wound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA advisory board , planning actual space missions , going to Russia , going through the pre @-@ cosmonaut biomedical protocols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the vents , and letting them see , and take samples and test instruments , and so on .
so , here we were making documentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
I &apos;d completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . but I also learned a lot about leadership .
now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , captain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions .
because I had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
why am I doing this ? what do I get out of it ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money at these damn shows .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
people sort of think I went away between &quot; Titanic &quot; and &quot; Avatar &quot; and was buffing my nails someplace , sitting at the beach .
made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience .
no fame , no glory , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is -- for the thrill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a tightly knit team .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
when you come back to the shore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fiber optic , and the attentuation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficulty , the human @-@ performance aspects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cops have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
so , when I came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; Avatar , &quot; I tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here I was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing &quot; Avatar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremendously exciting .
tremendously challenging .
and we became a family , over a four @-@ and @-@ half year period .
and it completely changed how I do movies .
so , people have commented on how , &quot; Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of Pandora . &quot;
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , I think number one is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
I have young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; Give me some advice for doing this . &quot;
and I say , &quot; Don &apos;t put limitations on yourself .
other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot;
NASA has this phrase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my full @-@ time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poorest two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their crops won &apos;t grow : there will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can &apos;t support .
and that leads to starvation , it leads to uncertainty , it leads to unrest .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy .
the coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution , and , even in the 1900s we &apos;ve seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , air @-@ conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it cheaper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new constraint , and that constraint has to do with CO2 .
CO2 is warming the planet , and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one .
if you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indirect effects , in that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and so you get ecosystem collapses .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feedbacks are , there &apos;s some uncertainty there , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
I asked the top scientists on this several times : do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; We &apos;re a twelve @-@ foot @-@ high truck trying to get under a ten @-@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squeeze under . &quot;
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
for each American , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all , so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
this equation has four factors , a little bit of multiplication : so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that &apos;s back from high school algebra , but let &apos;s take a look .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
the world today has 6.8 billion people .
that &apos;s headed up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vaccines , health care , reproductive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this encompasses everything : the food we eat , clothing , TV , heating .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means providing these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
here we have a very basic service : do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lamps .
now , efficiency , E , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite substantially .
some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make fertilizer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for improvement are far , far less .
and so , overall here , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three factors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewables and nuclear , puts out CO2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy miracles .
now , when I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the Internet and its services are a miracle .
so , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
usually , we don &apos;t have a deadline , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline .
now , I thought , &quot; How could I really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos , and somehow people enjoyed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
so , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I decided that releasing fireflies would be my contribution to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
I &apos;m told they don &apos;t bite ; in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
now , there &apos;s all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability , and , although there &apos;s many directions people are seeking , I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
I &apos;ve left out tide , geothermal , fusion , biofuels .
those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve burned it , going out the flue , pressurize it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it stays there .
now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tricky , and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard , but the toughest one here is this long @-@ term issue .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who &apos;s going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
next would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems : cost , particularly in highly regulated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human operators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
people need to feel good about it .
so three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , I &apos;ve grouped together .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
this is energy farming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are intermittent sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and , likewise , the wind doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it &apos;s not available .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have transmission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere .
and , finally , this storage problem .
and , to dimensionalize this , I went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what I found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches we have now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re counting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
is it a Manhattan Project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
and , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .
Bill Gross has several companies , including one called eSolar that has some great solar thermal technologies .
Vinod Khosla &apos;s investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
the idea of TerraPower is that , instead of burning a part of uranium -- the one percent , which is the U235 -- we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the U238 . &quot;
it is kind of a crazy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the advent of modern supercomputers that now you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have greatly improved cost profile .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the leftover waste from today &apos;s reactors .
so , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
it breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a candle .
you can see it &apos;s a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
in terms of fuel , this really solves the problem .
I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in Kentucky .
this is the leftover , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called depleted uranium .
that would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .
and , simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry , cement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether .
so , the other grade is : are we deploying this zero @-@ emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
that &apos;s super important .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
so , backing up from there , what should the 2020 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions : the less we emit , the less that sum will be of CO2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
these breakthroughs , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pilot projects , regulatory things that have been changed .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the Al Gore book , &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the David McKay book , &quot; Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly , because we need broad backing for this .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who &apos;s president , I could pick a vaccine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am I appealing to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research funding .
when countries get together in places like Copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just discuss the CO2 .
they should discuss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending on these innovative approaches .
we do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax , cap and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more understandable dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one I think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . so to understand more about TerraPower , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
Bil Gates : to actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the tough thing is building the pilot reactor ; finding the several billion , finding the regulator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as advertised , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and so , to understand it right , this involves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent uranium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
BG : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always refueling the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complexities .
and it just sits there and burns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
BG : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those reactors is actually what gets fed into ours , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically as you &apos;re going through this process .
I mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
BG : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Russia , India , China -- I &apos;ve been back seeing the secretary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy agenda .
so I &apos;m optimistic . you know , the French and Japanese have done some work .
this is a variant on something that has been done .
it &apos;s an important advance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built .
so , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
BG : well , we need -- for one of these high @-@ scale , electro @-@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy .
that &apos;s sort of the deadline that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , TerraPower , if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
and there are , fortunately now , dozens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , likewise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pilot plants goes well , that they can compete for this .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succeed .
in terms of big @-@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
BG : an energy breakthrough is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental constraint , but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid @-@ type reactor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the negatives , which are essentially the radiation -- the footprint and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emergency measures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
BG : if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over @-@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack : then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called geoengineering , which are various techniques that would delay the heating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that &apos;s just an insurance policy .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the geoengineering discussion about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect ?
climate skeptics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
BG : well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like AIDS .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing -- in fact , the IPCC report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say , &quot; OK , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
the fact is it &apos;s that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 constraints , then the skeptics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 , but I guess I &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s cheaper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
and so , that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the Earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
BG : well , the actual spending on the R &amp; amp ; D piece -- say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reasonable people can disagree , is when you have something that &apos;s non @-@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just funding the learning curve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the trade @-@ off you get into is , &quot; Let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and even Lomborg has changed .
his shtick now is , &quot; Why isn &apos;t the R &amp; amp ; D getting more discussed ? &quot;
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the skeptic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lonely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the R &amp; amp ; D point .
and so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate .
the R &amp; amp ; D piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s funded .
well Bill , I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
BG : thank you .
several years ago here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow challenge .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the tallest free @-@ standing structure out of 20 sticks of spaghetti , one yard of tape , one yard of string and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
and so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I incorporated it into a design workshop .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , I &apos;ve conducted about 70 design workshops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the CTOs of the Fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reveals very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
so , normally , most people begin by orienting themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jockey for power .
then they spend some time planning , organizing , they sketch and they lay out spaghetti .
they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever @-@ growing structures .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta @-@ da ! -- they admire their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta @-@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; uh @-@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
they lie , they cheat , they get distracted and they produce really lame structures .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta @-@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as Peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and Peter likes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CEO of spaghetti , Inc . right ?
they don &apos;t spend time jockeying for power .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
and then they execute on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kindergarteners do differently is that they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , successive prototypes , always keeping the marshmallow on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way .
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iterative process .
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
so the average for most people is around 20 inches ; business schools students , about half of that ; lawyers , a little better , but not much better than that , kindergarteners , better than most adults .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
thirty @-@ nine inches is the tallest structure I &apos;ve seen .
and why is it ? because they understand triangles and self @-@ reinforcing geometrical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
so CEOs , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an executive admin. on the team , they get significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of facilitation .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team &apos;s performance .
specialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and I tried something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
so I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here &apos;s what happened : not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high stakes have a strong impact .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incentives and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
and the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn &apos;t it ?
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows .
there &apos;s step @-@ by @-@ step instructions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
there &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
and the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; uh @-@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta @-@ da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s pretend right here we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , TED @-@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go backwards , you can go forwards ; you cannot stay where you are .
and I wonder what you &apos;d choose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were automobiles or Twitter or &quot; American Idol . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
and I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of that crowd , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m adventurous .
it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , declining rates of disease ...
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great @-@ grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grandparents pushed that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in on 80 .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in New Delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s vanished .
we vanquished it . puff .
in the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .
Diphtheria , rubella , polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is that despite all our accomplishments , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day .
that number &apos;s rising , and it &apos;s rising really rapidly , and it &apos;s disgraceful .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe .
potable water , arable land , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we innovate our way out of this mess , we &apos;re going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? and I think we can .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destroy it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wishful thinking .
but here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night : we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to deploy it properly in the way that we can today .
we &apos;re on the verge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the Enlightenment , to find a time when we battled progress , when we fought about these things more vigorously , on more fronts , than we do now .
people wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can &apos;t set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s entitled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even entitled to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you &apos;re not entitled to ?
you &apos;re not entitled to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
about a decade ago , I wrote a story about vaccines for The New Yorker . a little story .
and I was amazed to find opposition : opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
and soon after that , I wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Frankenfoods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a haphazard way , was trespassing on nature &apos;s ground .
but , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we file , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
but these stories bothered me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually I did .
and that &apos;s because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fanatics at all .
they were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just disturbed me so much .
but then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambivalently .
we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , the Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , hanging chads .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
and the reason that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of autism to the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine shot .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the United States , from England , from Sweden , from Canada , and it was all the same : no correlation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government official giving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disastrous .
disastrous because here &apos;s a fact : the United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down .
that is disgraceful , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it &apos;s horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , I understand it . I do understand it .
because , did anyone have measles here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death of measles -- 20 an hour .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like &quot; Oprah &quot; and &quot; Larry King Live . &quot;
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link causation and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , Jonas Salk .
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
no fear , no agony . polio -- puff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is Paul Offit .
he just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
it &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , Paul &apos;s a terrorist .
when Paul speaks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t testify without armed guards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because Paul made a vaccine .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of measles .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little strident .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wasn &apos;t going to vaccinate her kid against polio , no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , I don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to LAX , right now he &apos;s over Ohio .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paralytic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pretend it isn &apos;t .
now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
Echinacea , a little antioxidant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medicines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data says it all the time .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine ?
I &apos;m totally with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , I think I understand , we hate Big Pharma .
we hate Big Government . we don &apos;t trust the Man .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system sucks .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely astonishingly cold and soul @-@ bending to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we leap into the arms of Big Placebo .
that &apos;s fantastic . I love Big Placebo .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and I have all sorts of little props here .
none of it ... ginkgo , fraud ; echinacea , fraud ; acai -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fraud .
and you know what ? when I say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , &quot; What do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secretary of HHS who &apos;s saying , &quot; Hmm , I &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammograms , &quot; or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enemas .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people by insisting that beetroot , garlic and lemon oil were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS .
hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most mindless epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this absurd battle between proponents of genetically engineered food and the organic elite .
it &apos;s an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
it &apos;s ideology , it &apos;s not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every sprig of parsley , every Brussels sprout has been modified by man .
you know , there weren &apos;t tangerines in the garden of Eden .
there wasn &apos;t any cantaloupe .
there weren &apos;t Christmas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 11,000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
now we can do it in a more precise way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vitamin A into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prolong their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
we object to genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things I constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , monoculture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t companies patenting life .
we don &apos;t want companies owning seeds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s morality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very deadening , and it &apos;s preventing millions of people from prospering .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in Africa over the last 30 years .
Disgraceful . Disgraceful .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rotten stuff , like cassava for instance .
cassava &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be Chez Panisse , but it would be nice .
and all I can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insistence on having bigger food , better food , singular food .
this isn &apos;t about Rice Krispies , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re guilty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be guilty of : high @-@ tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amazingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
absolutely . absolutely , I do .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
I know that we can , and as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
for some time I have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , &quot; Something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies , the placebo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceutical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
something fake becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other , I want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick .
and I &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 1950s .
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll explain it .
and then I &apos;ll explain why I explained it .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
the knife , which you can examine ; my hand , which you could examine .
I &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
I &apos;ll get my sleeve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve I &apos;m just going to squeeze my wrist right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as I &apos;m squeezing there nothing can go up or down my sleeve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife .
in fact it &apos;s held so tightly in place that I can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , no trickery . and you can examine everything .
ta @-@ da !
so , this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about deception by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick methodologically .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I say I &apos;m going to grab hold of my wrist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , that is a lie .
the reason I &apos;m holding onto my wrist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as I move around my finger shifts .
and we could talk about why this is deceptive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then I open my hand up .
obviously it &apos;s clinging there , not by animal magnetism , but by chicanery , my index finger being there .
and then when I close my finger , same thing , as I move back , this motion kind of covers the moving back of my finger .
I take this hand away . you give the knife out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
I read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing .
it turns out that if you administer a placebo in the form of a white pill , that &apos;s like aspirin shaped -- it &apos;s just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect .
but if you change the form that you give the placebo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually measurably more effective .
even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical -- they &apos;re sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really flipped me out .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stops .
if you have capsules , they &apos;re more effective than tablets in any form .
a colored capsule , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule .
dosage has something to do with this .
one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills -- I don &apos;t remember the statistic now . sorry .
but the point is ...
... these dosages have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you &apos;ve go to the needle .
right ? a syringe with some inert -- a couple CCS of some inert something , and you inject this into a patient ...
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stronger than the white pill .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle .
and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
this is a seven @-@ inch hatpin . it &apos;s very , very sharp , and I &apos;m going to just sterilize it a tiny bit .
this is really my flesh . this is not Damian &apos;s special @-@ grown flesh .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a Hollywood special effect .
I &apos;m going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .
if you &apos;re queasy -- if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , I suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pierce .
I &apos;m sorry , man . am I freaking you out ?
OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the knife trick .
sort of .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
yes , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
they go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s certainly not dumb enough to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes .
so , let me give you a little peek .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , I know .
and the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a Hollywood special effect .
that &apos;s my flesh , and I can twist that around .
I &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting queasy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; Well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
well let me work up some blood for you .
yes , there it is .
normally now , I would take the needle out .
I would clean off my arm , and I would show you that there are no wounds .
but I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
I had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
this applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness , and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as messed up as anybody else is .
the first of these traps is a reluctance to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well @-@ being is .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lumped in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumstance that affects well @-@ being without distorting its importance .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question @-@ and @-@ answer session after one of my lectures reported a story , and that was a story -- He said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony , and it was absolutely glorious music and at the very end of the recording , there was a dreadful screeching sound .
and then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience .
but it hadn &apos;t .
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of glorious music .
they counted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
there is an experiencing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re @-@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it &apos;s the experiencing self that the doctor approaches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Does it hurt now when I touch you here ? &quot;
and then there is a remembering self , and the remembering self is the one that keeps score , and maintains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approaches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling lately ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your trip to Albania ? &quot; or something like that .
those are two very different entities , the experiencing self and the remembering self , and getting confused between them is part of the mess about the notion of happiness .
now , the remembering self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
I won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
here are two patients , those are their recordings .
and you are asked , &quot; Who of them suffered more ? &quot;
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
clearly , Patient B suffered more -- his colonoscopy was longer , and every minute of pain that Patient A had , Patient B had , and more .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here is a surprise .
the surprise is that Patient A had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy than Patient B.
the stories of the colonoscopies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great -- but one of them is this distinct ...
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their colonoscopy , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
and it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , clearly , B had a worse time .
now , what you could do with Patient A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much .
that will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experiencing self of Patient A worse off , and you have the remembering self of Patient A a lot better off , because now you have endowed Patient A with a better story about his experience .
what defines a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
what defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
now , the experiencing self lives its life continuously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really straightforward : they are lost forever .
I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 600,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
most of them are completely ignored by the remembering self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the remembering self keeps for us .
so we have the remembering self and the experiencing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinct .
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
from the point of view of the experiencing self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two @-@ week vacation is twice as good as the one @-@ week vacation .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remembering self .
for the remembering self , a two @-@ week vacation is barely better than the one @-@ week vacation because there are no new memories added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that distinguishes a remembering self from an experiencing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
now , the remembering self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colonoscopies with two different surgeons and is deciding which of them to choose , then the one that chooses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be chosen .
the experiencing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anticipated memories .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the remembering self , and you can think of the remembering self sort of dragging the experiencing self through experiences that the experiencing self doesn &apos;t need .
I have that sense that when we go on vacations this is very frequently the case ; that is , we go on vacations , to a very large extent , in the service of our remembering self .
and this is a bit hard to justify I think .
I mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
that is one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of the remembering self .
and when I think about that , I think about a vacation we had in Antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it relatively often , relative to how much I think of other vacations .
and I probably have consumed my memories of that three @-@ week trip , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if I had ever opened the folder with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite I have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question : why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so I want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that for your next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation all your pictures will be destroyed , and you &apos;ll get an amnesic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose a different vacation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of memories , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experiencing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experiencing self &apos;s life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experiencing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the remembering self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
this is not about how happily a person lives .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and I belong to a crowd of students of well @-@ being , who &apos;ve been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way .
the distinction between the happiness of the experiencing self and the satisfaction of the remembering self has been recognized in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separately .
the Gallup Organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happily they &apos;re living their life , and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about .5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; Oh his father is six feet tall , &quot; how much would you know about his height ?
well , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
you have that much uncertainty .
if I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are with their experiencing self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in California if , say , you live in Ohio .
and what happens is when you think about living in California , you are thinking of the contrast between California and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experiencing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflective self that decides how happy people are .
but now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier .
well , their experiencing self is not going to get happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well @-@ being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that Gallup survey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
Daniel Kahneman : sure .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experiencing self .
when we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sample of Americans , like 600,000 , so it &apos;s a large representative sample -- below an income of 600,000 dollars a year ...
60,000 .
DK : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
I mean I &apos;ve rarely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the remembering self , you get a different story .
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
but Danny , the whole American endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
DK : you know I think that there is recognition of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the recognition is going to be slow in the United States , no question about that , but in the U.K. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
how to enhance happiness goes very different ways depending on how you think , and whether you think of the remembering self or you think of the experiencing self .
this is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come .
in the United States , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
thank you , Danny Kahneman .
I &apos;m Jane McGonigal . I &apos;m a game designer .
I &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
now , I have a plan for this , and it entails convincing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
maybe too much time , considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
but actually , according to my research at The Institute For The Future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most urgent problems .
in fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
I &apos;ve calculated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sink in : if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , I believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
no . I &apos;m serious . I am .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much sums up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
this is a portrait by a photographer named Phil Toledano .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming , so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing .
and this is a classic gaming emotion .
now , if you &apos;re not a gamer , you might miss some of the nuance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , deep , deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem .
if you are a gamer , you will notice a few nuances here : the crinkle of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the eyebrows up is surprise .
this is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win .
Oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . OK , good , so we have some gamers among us .
an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an epic win .
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem @-@ solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all odds is on the verge of an epic win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems .
this is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
this is actually me making the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face .
this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeley , California , where I did my PhD on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and I don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
we do achieve more in game worlds . but I also mean good as in motivated to do something that matters , inspired to collaborate and to cooperate .
and when we &apos;re in game worlds I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel overcome , we feel overwhelmed , we feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
so , that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real @-@ world work ?
so , I looked at games like World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem @-@ solving environment .
and I started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds .
so , the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in World of Warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a world @-@ saving mission , right away .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
but it is on the verge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there &apos;s no unemployment in World of Warcraft .
there is no sitting around wringing your hands , there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
and there are also tons of collaborators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission .
that &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fingertips are tons of collaborators .
and also there is this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you guys have heard of leveling up and plus @-@ one strength , and plus @-@ one intelligence .
we don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when I get off this stage I &apos;m not going to have plus @-@ one speaking , and plus @-@ one crazy idea , plus @-@ 20 crazy idea .
I don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with collaborative online environments like World of Warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to be on the verge of an epic win all the time that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
so , so far , collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers have spent 5.93 million years solving the virtual problems of Azeroth .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
but to put that in context : 5.93 million years ago was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up .
that was the first upright primate .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently investing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it &apos;s also apt . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
this is true . I believe this .
so , consider this really interesting statistic ; it was recently published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University : the average young person today in a country with a strong gamer culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the United States 10,080 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance .
so , we have an entire parallel track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gamer as they are learning about everything else in school .
and some of you have probably read Malcolm Gladwell &apos;s new book &quot; outliers . &quot;
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours of effortful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtuosos at it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers .
so , the big question is , &quot; What exactly are gamers getting so good at ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have a virtually unprecedented human resource on our hands .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our virtuoso gamers , 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
the game industry is developing consoles that are low energy and that work with the wireless phone networks instead of broadband Internet so that gamers all over the world , particularly in India , China , Brazil , can get online .
they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers .
so , I &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at .
here are the four things I came up with . the first is urgent optimism .
OK , think of this as extreme self @-@ motivation .
urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to tackle an obstacle , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable hope of success .
gamers always believe that an epic win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
gamers don &apos;t sit around .
gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve beaten us badly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
and so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
blissful productivity . I love it .
you know there &apos;s a reason why the average World of Warcraft gamer plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a half @-@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happier working hard than we are relaxing , or hanging out .
we know that we are optimized , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
finally : epic meaning .
gamers love to be attached to awe @-@ inspiring missions to human planetary @-@ scale stories .
so , just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective : so , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wiki in the world .
second biggest wiki in the world , with nearly 80,000 articles , is the World of Warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they have compiled more information about World of Warcraft on the Internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world .
they are building an epic story .
they are building an epic knowledge resource about the World of Warcraft .
okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing : gamers are super @-@ empowered , hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist named Edward Castronova .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; We &apos;re witnessing what amounts to no less than a mass exodus to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
and he &apos;s an economist . so , he &apos;s rational .
and he says ...
not like me -- I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m exuberant .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
now , I also agree that that is rational , for now .
but it is not , by any means , an optimal situation .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
so , I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
these are ancient dice , made out of sheep &apos;s knuckles . right ?
before we had awesome game controllers , we had sheep &apos;s knuckles .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
Herodotus says that games , particularly dice games , were invented in the kingdom of Lydia during a time of famine .
apparently , there was such a severe famine that the king of Lydia decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to Herodotus , they invented dice games and they set up a kingdom @-@ wide policy : on one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and they would be so immersed in playing the dice games because games are so engaging , and immerse us in such satisfying blissful productivity , they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat .
and then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
and according to Herodotus , they passed 18 years this way , surviving through a famine by eating on one day and playing games on the next .
now , this is exactly , I think , how we &apos;re using games today .
we &apos;re using games to escape real @-@ world suffering .
we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satisfying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is really exciting .
according to Herodotus , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final dice game .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
they played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure .
they would leave Lydia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could thrive .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , DNA evidence has shown that the Etruscans , who then led to the Roman Empire , actually share the same DNA as the ancient Lydians .
and so , recently , scientists have suggested that Herodotus &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine .
so , this crazy story might be true .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , escaping to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing Warcraft since 1994 .
that was the first real @-@ time strategy game from the World of Warcraft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played dice games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing Warcraft for 16 years .
I say we are ready for our own epic game .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where I get my 21 billion hours a week of game @-@ play from .
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve real @-@ world problems .
now , I know you &apos;re asking , &quot; How are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what I have devoted my work to over the past few years , at The Institute For The Future .
we have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto , and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the best @-@ case scenario outcome , and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality .
we want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
I &apos;m just going to very briefly show you three games that I &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures .
so , this is World Without Oil .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shortage .
the oil shortage is fictional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , you tell us where you live , and then we give you real @-@ time news , videos , data feeds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transportation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there is rioting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
we piloted this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve tracked them for the three years since .
and I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve run out of oil .
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game .
so , for the next world @-@ saving game , we decided to aim higher : bigger problem than just peak oil .
we did a game called Superstruct at The Institute For The Future .
and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer was called the Global Extinction Awareness System , of course .
we asked people to come online almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie .
you know Jerry Bruckheimer movies , you form a dream team -- you &apos;ve got the astronaut , the scientist , the ex @-@ convict , and they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; Everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
we had 8,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
they came up with 500 insanely creative solutions that you can go online , if you Google &quot; Superstruct , &quot; and see .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re launching it March 3rd . this is a game done with the World Bank Institute .
if you complete the game you will be certified by the World Bank Institute , as a Social innovator , class of 2010 .
working with universities all over sub @-@ Saharan Africa , and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills .
we &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got leveling up in skills like local insight , knowledge networking , sustainability , vision and resourcefulness .
I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .
so , I &apos;m going to wrap up now .
I want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gamers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
well I hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real @-@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these amazing superpowers : blissful productivity , the ability to weave a tight social fabric , this feeling of urgent optimism and the desire for epic meaning .
I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when I look forward to the next decade , I know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
so , I say : let the world @-@ changing games begin .
thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Italian Wired .
I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I &apos;m writing anything , but I &apos;d already finished editing the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
let me read you the entry .
&quot; disabled , adjective : crippled , helpless , useless , wrecked , stalled , maimed , wounded , mangled , lame , mutilated , run @-@ down , worn @-@ out , weakened , impotent , castrated , paralyzed , handicapped , senile , decrepit , laid @-@ up , done @-@ up , done @-@ for , done @-@ in cracked @-@ up , counted @-@ out ; see also hurt , useless and weak .
Antonyms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing , it was so ludicrous , but I &apos;d just gotten past &quot; mangled , &quot; and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed .
you know , of course , this is my raggedy old thesaurus so I &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 1980s , when I would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , needless to say , thank God I wasn &apos;t using a thesaurus back then .
I mean , from this entry , it would seem that I was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
so , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition , expecting to find a revision worth noting .
here &apos;s the updated version of this entry .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the last two words under &quot; Near Antonyms , &quot; particularly unsettling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wholesome . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the Greeks and the Romans , believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful , because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s empowered ?
by casually doing something as simple as naming a person , a child , we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the A.I. DuPont Institute in Wilmington , Delaware .
his name was Dr. Pizzutillo , an Italian American , whose name , apparently , was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce , so he went by Dr. P.
and Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises with these thick , elastic bands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and I hated these bands more than anything -- I hated them , had names for them . I hated them .
and , you know , I was already bargaining , as a five year @-@ old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises , unsuccessfully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my session -- exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow . Aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
when you do break it , I &apos;m going to give you a hundred bucks . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple ploy on Dr. P &apos;s part to get me to do the exercises I didn &apos;t want to do before the prospect of being the richest five @-@ year @-@ old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence into a new and promising experience for me .
and I have to wonder today to what extent his vision and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong , powerful and athletic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child .
but , in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries , our language isn &apos;t allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical standpoint , my legs , laser surgery for vision impairment , titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them -- not to mention social networking platforms allow people to self @-@ identify , to claim their own descriptions of themselves , so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing .
so , perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset .
the human ability to adapt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity , and I &apos;m going to make an admission : this phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
implicit in this phrase of &quot; overcoming adversity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience unscathed or unmarked by the experience , as if my successes in life have come about from an ability to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics , or what other people perceive as my disability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
and I &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adversity isn &apos;t an obstacle that we need to get around in order to resume living our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and I tend to think of it like my shadow .
sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and , certainly , I &apos;m not trying to diminish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
there is adversity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet adversity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity , but preparing them to meet it well .
and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
there &apos;s an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I &apos;m disabled .
and , truthfully , the only real and consistent disability I &apos;ve had to confront is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .
by not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we are effectively grading someone &apos;s worth to our community .
so we need to see through the pathology and into the range of human capability .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability .
so it &apos;s not about devaluing , or negating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity .
so maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see adversity as natural , consistent and useful , we &apos;re less burdened by the presence of it .
this year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illustrated , I think , a truth about the human character .
to paraphrase : it &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the most intelligent that survives ; it is the one that is most adaptable to change .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
from Darwin &apos;s work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe that &apos;s what adversity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we can re @-@ imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
adversity is just change that we haven &apos;t adapted ourselves to yet .
I think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
I don &apos;t think so .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility -- or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
anthropologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribute .
there &apos;s evidence that Neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community .
they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and useless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
a few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania , and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes .
it was summertime : I had shorts on .
I hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; Well , if it isn &apos;t Aimee Mullins . &quot;
and I turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . I have no idea who he is .
and I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
he said , &quot; Well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
I mean , when we met I was delivering you from your mother &apos;s womb . &quot;
Oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was Dr. Kean , a man that I had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
and so my mother &apos;s prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
and , because I was born without the fibula bones , and had feet turned in , and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that , he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news .
he said to me , &quot; I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you &apos;ve been making liar out of me ever since . &quot;
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spelling bee , marching with the Girl Scouts , you know , the Halloween parade , winning my college scholarship , or any of my sports victories , and he was using it , and integrating it into teaching resident students , med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School .
and he called this part of the course the X Factor , the potential of the human will .
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
and Dr. Kean went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
see , Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh @-@ and @-@ bone legs , I wouldn &apos;t have hesitated for a second .
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
but if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them , not in spite of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because I &apos;ve been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educate &quot; comes from the root word &quot; educe . &quot;
it means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 1960s Britain , when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools .
it &apos;s called the streaming trials . we call it &quot; tracking &quot; here in the States .
it &apos;s separating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
and the &quot; A students &quot; get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three @-@ month period , D @-@ level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three @-@ month period , they were performing at A @-@ level .
and , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the &quot; A students &quot; and told them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three @-@ month period .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , &quot; These are the &apos; A @-@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; D @-@ students . &apos; &quot; and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been crushed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
if instead , we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imaginative , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a fourteenth @-@ century Persian poet named Hafiz that my friend , Jacques Dembois told me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who Only knows Four Words &quot; : &quot; every child has known God , not the God of names , not the God of don &apos;ts , but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them , saying , &apos; Come dance with me .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; thank you .
I want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities , or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again .
we at Berkeley Bionics call these robots exoskeletons .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further enhance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
but not only that -- it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldier , that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
obviously , this is resulting in some major complications -- back injuries , 30 percent of them -- chronic back injuries .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue .
so let me now introduce to you HULC -- or the Human Universal load Carrier .
with the HULC exoskeleton , I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain for many hours .
its flexible design allows for deep squats , crawls and high @-@ agility movements .
it senses what I want to do , where I want to go , and then augments my strength and endurance .
we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .
so this is for real .
now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the wheelchair users , something that I &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide .
this is about one percent of the total population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life -- 20s , 30s , 40s -- hit a wall and the wheelchair &apos;s the only option .
but it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers .
and the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s stroke or other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful introduction , I must say .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
let me now introduce you to eLEGS that is worn by Amanda Boxtel that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
thank you .
Amanda is wearing our eLEGS set .
it has sensors .
it &apos;s completely non @-@ invasive , sensors in the crutches that send signals back to our onboard computer that is sitting here at her back .
there are battery packs here as well that power motors that are sitting at her hips , as well as her knee joints , that move her forward in this kind of smooth and very natural gait .
I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a freak summersault while downhill skiing paralyzed me .
in a split second , I lost all sensation and movement below my pelvis .
not long afterwards , a doctor strode into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; Amanda , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
and that was 19 yeas ago .
he robbed every ounce of hope from my being .
adaptive technology has since enabled me to learn how to downhill ski again , to rock climb and even handcycle .
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for Amanda here and all the wheelchair users , but for everyone .
thanks .
back in New York , I am the head of development for a non @-@ profit called Robin Hood .
when I &apos;m not fighting poverty , I &apos;m fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company .
now in our town , where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunteer on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in .
but still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be .
when I found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pouring rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , barefoot , while her house was in flames .
the other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him Lex Luther -- got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .
the dog ! I was stunned with jealousy .
here was some lawyer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
well , I was next .
the captain waved me over .
he said , &quot; Bezos , I need you to go into the house .
I need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
I swear .
so , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no hero .
I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door .
we took our treasures outside to the homeowner , where , not surprisingly , his received much more attention than did mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home .
the act of kindness she noted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
in both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
and you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
they all matter .
so as I look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , I would offer this reminder : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
if you have something to give , give it now .
serve food at a soup kitchen . clean up a neighborhood park .
be a mentor .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , Mark , come back .
thank you .
I just came back from a community that holds the secret to human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hello , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
and no , this isn &apos;t burning Man or San Francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of Congo .
bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .
that means we all share a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are well @-@ known for their aggression .
but unfortunately , we have made too much of an emphasis of this aspect in our narratives of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees are dominated by big , scary guys , bonobo society is run by empowered females .
these guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least understood of the great apes .
they live in the depths of the Congolese jungle , and it has been very difficult to study them .
the Congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the First World War .
not surprisingly , this destruction also endangers bonobo survival .
Bushmeat trades and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small stadium with all the bonobos that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees .
who are these cousins ?
we know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; apes since they have frequent , promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
now , I &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bonobo life than the Kama Sutra .
bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
play is not just child &apos;s games .
for us and them , play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance .
it &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonobo play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter , dance and ritual .
play is the glue that binds us together .
now , I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild .
first , it &apos;s a ball game bonobo @-@ style -- and I do not mean football .
so here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game .
have a look what she &apos;s doing .
it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the balls . &quot;
only I think that he &apos;s rather loving it here , right ?
yeah .
so sex play is common in both bonobos and humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inventiveness of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as testicles -- and also how play both requires trust and fosters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
but play &apos;s a shapeshifter .
play &apos;s a shapeshifter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more quiet , imaginative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered anew .
and I want you to see , this is Fuku , a young female , and she is quietly playing with water .
I think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity .
so these are just small tasters into the insights that bonobo give us to our past and present .
but they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to an increasingly challenging world through greater creativity and greater cooperation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
in other words , play is our adaptive wildcard .
in order to adapt successfully to a changing world , we need to play .
but will we make the most of our playfulness ?
play is not frivolous .
play &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and claw .
in times when it seems least appropriate to play , it might be the times when it is most urgent .
and so , my fellow primates , let us embrace this gift from evolution and play together , as we rediscover creativity , fellowship and wonder .
thank you .
I want you to imagine two couples in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day , at the exact same moment , each conceiving a baby -- okay ?
so two couples each conceiving one baby .
now I don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagining the conception , because if you spend all that time imagining that conception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
so just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , I want to imagine that , in one case , the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome , meeting that X chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm is carrying an X chromosome , meeting the X chromosome of the egg .
both are viable ; both take off .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
so I wear two hats in most of what I do .
as the one hat , I do history of anatomy .
I &apos;m a historian by training , and what I study in that case is the way that people have dealt with anatomy -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they dealt with bodily fluids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
the other hat that I &apos;ve worn in my work is as an activist , as a patient advocate -- or , as I sometimes say , as an impatient advocate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
in that case , what I &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms .
so some of what I &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are conjoined twins -- two people within one body .
some of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have dwarfism -- so people who are much shorter than typical .
and a lot of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have atypical sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
and as a general term , we can use the term intersex for this .
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms .
I &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
so in one instance , you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis , and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto @-@ gonads , which we all have in the fetal life , to become testes .
and so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone .
but because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to the testosterone .
and this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome .
so lots of levels of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body develops more along the female typical path .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
and it &apos;s often not until she hits puberty and she &apos;s growing and developing breasts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something &apos;s up here .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus , she actually has testes inside , and she has a Y chromosome .
now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
females , like males , have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the adrenal glands make androgens , which are a masculinizing hormone .
most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don &apos;t actually know my chromosomal make @-@ up but I think I &apos;m probably typical -- most females like me are actually androgen @-@ sensitive .
we &apos;re making androgen , and we &apos;re responding to androgens .
the consequence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens than the woman born with testes who has androgen insensitivity syndrome .
so sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that intersex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
another example : a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside .
what he had was an extreme form of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia .
he had XX chromosomes , and in the womb , his adrenal glands were in such high gear that it created , essentially , a masculine hormonal environment .
and as a consequence , his genitals were masculinzed , his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones .
and he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything .
and it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female internally .
okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex .
some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis , which is when you have ovarian tissue with testicular tissue wrapped around it .
and we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
so sex can come in lots of different varieties .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s dwarfism , or it &apos;s conjoined twinning , or it &apos;s an intersex type -- are often normalized by surgeons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
the reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , allegedly , is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history .
and so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually presents us something quite different , it startles us in terms of those categorizations .
so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism .
and our nation &apos;s really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism .
well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African runner , Caster Semenya , had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin .
I had a lot of journalists calling me , asking me , &quot; Which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not Caster Semenya is male or female ? &quot;
and I had to explain to the journalists there isn &apos;t such a test .
in fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to admit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and intersex and female and intersex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
so what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes , the more we have to admit to ourselves that these categories that we thought of as stable anatomical categories that mapped very simply to stable identity categories are a lot more fuzzy than we thought .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
it &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed .
as we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanzees .
what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides ?
and as we get farther and farther with our science , we get more and more into a discomforted zone where we have to acknowledge that the simplistic categories we &apos;ve had are probably overly simplistic .
so we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
one of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the United States today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations nowadays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
at most , they &apos;d stick a feather on somebody &apos;s nose , and if it twitched , they didn &apos;t bury them yet .
if it stopped twitching , you bury them .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
and as a consequence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categories as we &apos;ve had before .
now you might think that all this breaking @-@ down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
I &apos;m a political progressive , I defend people with unusual bodies , but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous .
understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense .
and it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
so in order to tell you about that tension , I have to first admit to you that I &apos;m a huge fan of the Founding Fathers .
I know they were racists , I know they were sexist , but they were great .
I mean , they were so brave and so bold and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that cheesy musical &quot; 1776 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally forgettable .
it &apos;s because of what happened in 1776 with the Founding Fathers .
the Founding Fathers were , for my point of view , the original anatomical activists , and this is why .
what they rejected was an anatomical concept and replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
so as you all recall , what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the monarchs of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of DNA , but they did have a concept of birthright .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grandfather to father to son and so forth .
the Founding Fathers rejected that idea , and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
they leveled that playing field and decided the anatomy that mattered was the commonality of anatomy , not the difference in anatomy , and that was a really radical thing to do .
now they were doing it in part because they were part of an Enlightenment system where two things were growing up together .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world .
they were moving away from supernatural explanations , and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power , where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright .
they were moving towards a naturalistic concept .
and if you look , for example , in the Declaration of Independence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s God .
they don &apos;t talk about God and God &apos;s nature .
they &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Civil Rights movement of the future .
they didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
so what happened years afterward ?
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the Founding Fathers &apos; concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said , &quot; The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women successfully argued that .
next came the successful Civil Rights movement , where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about , &quot; Ain &apos;t I a woman ? &quot;
we find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying , &quot; I am a man . &quot;
again , people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy , again , successfully .
we see the same thing with the disability rights movement .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that commonality , we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions .
now mind you , I want to maintain some divisions , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , I don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
I don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on anatomy .
I don &apos;t want to say five @-@ year @-@ olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry .
so there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that I think we should retain .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning .
so let &apos;s go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both conceived in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , Mary , is born three months prematurely , so she &apos;s born on June 1 , 1980 .
Henry , by contrast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on March 1 , 1980 .
simply by virtue of the fact that Mary was born prematurely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Henry does -- the right to consent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
Henry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , biologically , except in terms of when he was born .
we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are .
Henry , by virtue of being assumed to be male -- although I haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the XY one -- by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted , which Mary does not need to worry about .
Mary , meanwhile , cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states , namely , the right to marry .
Henry can marry in every state a woman , but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman .
so we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable .
and the question to me becomes : what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on anatomy might start falling apart ?
I don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
so where do we go ?
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
so for example , Texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a Y chromosome , and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome .
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromosomes .
but this is also very bizarre , because of the story I told you at the beginning about androgen insensitivity syndrome .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Luther King , he offers us something of a solution in his &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech .
he says we should judge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond anatomy .
and I want to say , &quot; Yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do you judge people based on the content of character ?
I also want to point out that I &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans , because , I have to admit , that there are some golden Retrievers I know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans I know .
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know that are more capable of informed , intelligent , mature decisions about sexual relations than some 40 @-@ year @-@ olds that I know .
so how do we operationalize the question of content of character ?
it turns out to be really difficult .
and part of me also wonders , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scannable in the future -- able to be seen with an fMRI ?
do we really want to go there ?
I &apos;m not sure where we go .
what I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
we &apos;ve done a really good job struggling with democracy , and I think we would do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t have a situation that Iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered , unless he &apos;s willing to submit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
we don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
I &apos;m glad to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surgeon I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of conjoined twins in order to separate them , partly to make a name for himself .
but when I was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high @-@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .
my response to him was , &quot; Well , have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery ? &quot;
the United States has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state .
so I think we have to be in the lead .
well , just to close , I want to suggest to you that I &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fathers .
and I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insights that can come from different kinds of anatomies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
now for years , because I &apos;ve been interested in intersex , I &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
and one of the things that I &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
and what we know from cross @-@ cultural studies is that females , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
years ago , when I was in graduate school , one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism -- I considered myself a feminist , as I still do -- asked a really strange question .
he said , &quot; Tell me what &apos;s feminine about feminism . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Well that &apos;s the dumbest question I &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender , so there &apos;s nothing feminine about feminism . &quot;
but the more I thought about his question , the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism .
that is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more attentive to deeply complex social relationships and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable .
so whereas the fathers were extremely attentive to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
and maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond anatomy , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
thank you .
I &apos;m Jessi , and this is my suitcase .
but before I show you what I &apos;ve got inside , I &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is , I &apos;m outfit @-@ obsessed .
I love finding , wearing , and more recently , photographing and blogging a different , colorful , crazy outfit for every single occasion .
but I don &apos;t buy anything new .
I get all my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores .
Aww , thank you .
secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet .
I get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; I look pretty unique ; and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt .
I mean , what am I going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will I like the color ?
will it be under $ 20 ?
if all the answers are yes , I feel as though I &apos;ve won .
I want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what I packed for this exciting week here at TED .
I mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
so I &apos;m going to show you exactly what I brought .
I brought seven pairs of underpants and that &apos;s it .
exactly one week &apos;s worth of undies is all I put in my suitcase .
I was betting that I &apos;d be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Palm Springs .
and since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around TED in her underwear -- that means I found a few things .
and I &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of outfits right now .
does that sound good ?
so as I do this , I &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new .
so let &apos;s start with Sunday .
I call this &quot; shiny Tiger . &quot;
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look phenomenal for under $ 50 .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me $ 55 , and it was the most expensive thing that I wore the entire week .
Monday : color is powerful .
it is almost physiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you &apos;re wearing bright red pants .
if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
Tuesday : fitting in is way overrated .
I &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
just be who you are .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
Wednesday : embrace your inner child .
sometimes people tell me that I look like I &apos;m playing dress @-@ up , or that I remind them of their seven @-@ year @-@ old .
I like to smile and say , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
Thursday : confidence is key .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
and if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day @-@ in and day @-@ out .
but it wasn &apos;t until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant .
and I &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
thank you .
Friday : a universal truth -- five words for you : gold sequins go with everything .
and finally , Saturday : developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it &apos;s been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conversations .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .
so before I go home to Brooklyn , I &apos;m going to donate everything back .
because the lesson I &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
I don &apos;t need to get emotionally attached to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , colorful , shiny outfit just waiting for me , if I put a little love in my heart and look .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody .
I &apos;ve got something to show you .
think about this as a pixel , a flying pixel .
this is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
let me tell you a bit about it .
now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian originally , and every boy in Italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom -- but the reason I &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in Formula 1 racing over the past couple of decades .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a Formula 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monitors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , transmitting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
this is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
and basically , it &apos;s a system made of two components -- a sensing and an actuating component .
what is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blanketed with networks , electronics .
they &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
and , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated .
if we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
just as an aside , I wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the Earth &apos;s crust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
they are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions .
so if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
beyond cities , all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects .
that &apos;s from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing at MoMA later this year , during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; Talk to Me . &quot;
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator .
and that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...
you know , when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses , at the end it said that he took the hammer , threw it at the Moses -- actually you can still see a small chip underneath -- and said , shouted , &quot; Perch√© non parli ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and I &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it .
let &apos;s starting with sensing .
well , the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
it was four and a half years ago in Italy .
and what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been deployed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cellphone network -- and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network , that &apos;s collected anyway by the operator , in order to understand how the city works .
the summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
it &apos;s when Italy won the soccer World Cup .
some of you might remember , it was Italy and France playing , and then Zidane at the end , the headbutt .
and anyway , Italy won at the end .
now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network .
here you see the city .
you see the Colosseum in the middle , the river Tiber .
it &apos;s morning , before the match .
you see the timeline on the top .
early afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
the match begins -- silence .
France scores . Italy scores .
halftime , people make a quick call and go to the bathroom .
second half . end of normal time .
first overtime , second .
Zidane , the headbutt in a moment .
Italy wins . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
you saw the big peak .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time .
and then everybody moved down .
you see the image of the place called Circo Massimo , where , since Roman times , people go to celebrate , to have a big party , and you see the peak at the end of the day .
well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
another quick example about sensing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consume .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a Mac computer , how they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system .
so we actually started with a number of volunteers who helped us in Seattle , just over a year ago , to tag what they were throwing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the trash and then started following it .
here are the results we just obtained .
from Seattle ...
after one week .
with this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of inefficiencies in the system .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
this data was not available before .
but there &apos;s a lot of wasted transportation and convoluted things happening .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we &apos;re throwing away , it doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re throwing away every day still stays there .
and if we show that to people , then we can also promote some behavioral change .
so that was the reason for the project .
my colleague at MIT , Assaf Biderman , he could tell you much more about sensing and many other wonderful things we can do with sensing , but I wanted to go to the second part we discussed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actuating our environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Zaragoza , Spain .
it started with a question by the mayor of the city , who came to us saying that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
and the question was : how could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
and one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop was , imagine this pipe , and you &apos;ve got valves , solenoid valves , taps , opening and closing .
you create like a water curtain with pixels made of water .
if those pixels fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
and even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
well , we presented this to Mayor Belloch .
he liked it very much .
and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
we called it Digital Water Pavilion .
the whole building is made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
the roof also is covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to minimize splashing , you can actually lower the roof .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappear , like in this case .
you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; They demolished the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t demolish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears .
here &apos;s the building working .
you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside .
and here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water .
well , I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
all the kids from Zaragoza came to the building , because the way of engaging with the building became something different .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
but then reality &apos;s always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
here is an image then of the building with the physical pixels , the pixels made of water , and then projections on them .
and this is what led us to think about the following project I &apos;ll show you now .
that &apos;s , imagine those pixels could actually start flying .
imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .
here is the video .
so imagine one helicopter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in synchrony .
so you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a regular configuration in two dimensions .
or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pixels &apos; position .
you can play with a different type .
imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes , different types of resolution .
but then the whole thing can be just a 3D cloud of pixels that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many directions .
here is the real Flyfire control and going down to form the regular grid as before .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
you can have each pixel having an input that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
I want to show you something here for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with Roberto Bolle , one of today &apos;s top ballet dancers -- the √©toile at Metropolitan in New York and La Scala in Milan -- and actually captured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an input for Flyfire .
and here you can see Roberto dancing .
you see on the left the pixels , the different resolutions being captured .
it &apos;s both 3D scanning in real time and motion capture .
so you can reconstruct a whole movement .
you can go all the way through .
but then , once we have the pixels , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and gravity and rotation .
so we want to use this as one of the possible inputs for Flyfire .
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the London Olympics .
it &apos;s called The Cloud .
and the idea here is , imagine , again , we can involve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to impart what we call cloud raising -- like barn raising , but with a cloud .
imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel .
and I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
this has been digitizing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the Internet .
now today , for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self @-@ organizing power of networks , to the physical one .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
that means something built in a city .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to tackle today &apos;s pressing challenges -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made of pixels , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pixels .
it &apos;s a physical structure in London , but covered with pixels .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the Olympics in 2012 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like London &apos;s new mountaintop .
you can enter inside it .
and a kind of new digital beacon for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work I &apos;m trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago , where I saw my first icebergs .
I was in awe .
my heart beat fast , my head was dizzy , trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me .
the icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake , year after year .
icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion .
it &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an iceberg , that they &apos;re isolated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
but the reality is far from it .
as an iceberg melts , I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
as the iceberg melts , it is releasing mineral @-@ rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life .
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
it is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life .
some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
the last pictures I &apos;d like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq , Greenland .
it &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .
so here it is .
you can see on the left side a small boat .
that &apos;s about a 15 @-@ foot boat .
and I &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is an average @-@ size Greenlandic iceberg .
it &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
thank you .
I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
but the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is tempt .
tempt was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; Dad , my legs are tingling . &quot;
and that was the onset of ALS .
so tempt is now completely paralyzed .
he only has use of his eyes .
I was exposed to him .
I have a company that does design and animation , so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world .
and so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony , tempt , and his cause .
so I went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; I just want to be able to talk to Tony again .
I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking -- don &apos;t all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; No , unless you &apos;re in the upper echelon and you &apos;ve got really amazing insurance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
these devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
has everyone seen the movie &quot; The diving Bell and the Butterfly ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
I said , &quot; That &apos;s archaic . how can that be ? &quot;
so I showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash .
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- I &apos;m like , &quot; All right , here &apos;s the deal : Tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
so I spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
I met these guys called GRL , graffiti Research Lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser pointer , draw on it , and it just registers the negative space .
so they go around and do art installations like this .
all the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
first it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with cuss words , then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art .
but there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
so I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; Well wait a second . if we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for tempt to control a laser and he could do graf again ? well that would be awesome . &quot;
so that started the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d accomplished a couple things .
one , we battered down the doors of the insurance companies , and we actually got tempt a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine .
which was awesome .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; I &apos;m not worthy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
my wife and kids and I moved to our back garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house .
a lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the Venice boardwalk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
this is called the EyeWriter , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk , some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack .
we took a PS3 camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an LED light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free .
and now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
there &apos;s no insurance company that can say &quot; No . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; No . &quot;
anybody who &apos;s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to tempt &apos;s room .
I love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
so there &apos;s all this hustle and Bustle going on for the big unveiling .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , carb @-@ fest and all @-@ night sessions , Tony drew again for the first time in seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
we kicked his bed so that he could see out .
and we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
and he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
the funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too .
so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; that was the first time I &apos;ve drawn anything for seven years .
I feel like I had been held underwater , and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that awesome ?
so that &apos;s kind of our battle cry .
that &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
and we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
this is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch .
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of acknowledgment .
we &apos;ve won a bunch of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
it &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
so the awards were like , &quot; Oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
Armstrong Twittered about us , and then in December , Time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010 , which was really cool .
the coolest thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s completing the whole circle -- is that in April of this year , at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; Art of the Streets . &quot;
and &quot; Art of the Streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad @-@ asses of the street art scene -- Banksy , Shepard Fairey , KAWS -- all of these guys will be there .
tempt &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
so basically this is my point : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the EyeWriter -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
I &apos;m not a programmer , never done anything with ocular recognition technology , but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
and this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
thank you guys .
you know , what I do is write for children , and I &apos;m probably America &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
and I always tell people that I don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leathers , and no one has ever chose farmer .
I &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace .
you &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany .
that &apos;s a painting of a circle .
a friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that I &apos;m going to tell you about .
my circle began back in the &apos; 60s in high school in stow , Ohio where I was the class queer .
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers &apos; lounge .
she did it in secret .
she did it for three years .
and I had to get out of town .
I had a thumb , I had 85 dollars , and I ended up in San Francisco , California -- met a lover -- and back in the &apos; 80s , found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations .
about three or four years ago , I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , Mrs. Posten , who said , &quot; I need to see you .
I &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
could you please come to Ohio , and please bring that man that I know you have found by now .
and I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer , and I &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
well , the next day we were in Cleveland .
we took a look at her , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands .
and what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epiphany I talked about presented itself .
the epiphany is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life ; I and my partner saved hers .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
it needs truth and beauty , and I &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
it also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
thank you .
the idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple .
we don &apos;t want Iran to get the bomb .
their major asset for developing nuclear weapons is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility .
the gray boxes that you see , these are real @-@ time control systems .
now if we manage to compromise these systems that control drive speeds and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
the gray boxes don &apos;t run Windows software ; they are a completely different technology .
but if we manage to place a good Windows virus on a notebook that is used by a maintenance engineer to configure this gray box , then we are in business .
and this is the plot behind Stuxnet .
so we start with a Windows dropper .
the payload goes onto the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed -- mission accomplished .
that &apos;s easy , huh ?
I want to tell you how we found that out .
when we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
the only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the Windows part , the dropper part , used multiple zero @-@ day vulnerabilities .
and it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these real @-@ time control systems .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with Stuxnet and checked this thing out .
and then some very funny things happened .
Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese -- sniffed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
didn &apos;t make sense to me .
and after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , I realized , well , this is a directed attack .
it &apos;s completely directed .
the dropper is prowling actively on the gray box if a specific configuration is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to infect is actually running on that target .
and if not , Stuxnet does nothing .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because I thought , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
it could be , let &apos;s say for example , a U.S. power plant , or a chemical plant in Germany .
so we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
so we extracted and decompiled the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s structured in two digital bombs -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
and we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information .
they knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
they probably even know the shoe size of the operator .
so they know everything .
and if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet is complex and high @-@ tech , let me tell you this : the payload is rocket science .
it &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
we are talking about -- around about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like old @-@ style assembly language .
and I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
so what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
and then we were looking for timers and data structures and trying to relate them to the real world -- to potential real world targets .
so we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove .
in order to get target theories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hardcore sabotage , it must be a high @-@ value target and it is most likely located in Iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections had been reported .
now you don &apos;t find several thousand targets in that area .
it basically boils down to the Bushehr nuclear power plant and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant .
so I told my assistant , &quot; Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base . &quot;
and I phoned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their expertise with what we found in code and data .
and that worked pretty well .
so we were able to associate the small digital warhead with the rotor control .
the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and creepy -- obviously in an effort to drive maintenance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
the big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number 164 really stands out in that code ; you can &apos;t overlook it .
I started to research scientific literature on how these centrifuges are actually built in Natanz and found they are structured in what is called a cascade , and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges .
so that made sense , that was a match .
and it even got better .
these centrifuges in Iran are subdivided into 15 , what is called , stages .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a real good match .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to recover .
anyway , so we figured out that both digital warheads were actually aiming at one and the same target , but from different angles .
the small warhead is taking one cascade , and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down , and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves .
so in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
it is Natanz , and it is only Natanz .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets might be hit by Stuxnet .
here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really knocked my socks off .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the centrifuges .
now what this thing does is it intercepts the input values from sensors -- so for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors -- and it provides legitimate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet .
so it &apos;s just like from the Hollywood movies where during the heist , the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video .
that &apos;s cool , huh ?
the idea here is obviously not only to fool the operators in the control room .
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
we need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act quick enough .
so for example , in a power plant , when your big steam turbine gets too over speed , you must open relief valves within a millisecond .
obviously , this cannot be done by a human operator .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
and when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen .
your plant can blow up .
and neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and this is very important , what I &apos;m going to say .
think about this : this attack is generic .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in specifics , with centrifuges , with uranium enrichment .
so it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automobile factory .
it is generic .
and you don &apos;t have -- as an attacker -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this payload by a USB stick , as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet .
you could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
just spread it as wide as possible .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the Middle East .
they &apos;re in the United States and Europe and in Japan .
so all of the green areas , these are your target @-@ rich environments .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
thanks .
I &apos;ve got a question .
Ralph , it &apos;s been quite widely reported that people assume that Mossad is the main entity behind this .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to hear that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is that the Mossad is involved , but that the leading force is not Israel .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
there is only one , and that &apos;s the United States -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . thank you , Ralph .
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
I went to prison -- difficult .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
I filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
and I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
in fact , most of my career , I &apos;ve been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience .
so when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship , I knew I would want to do something a little different .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , I took out an ad on eBay .
I sent out some Facebook messages , some Twitter messages , and I gave people the opportunity to buy the naming rights to my 2011 TED Talk .
that &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corporation , for @-@ profit or non @-@ profit , was going to get the once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity -- because I &apos;m sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the naming rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a title , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much hint as to what the subject matter would actually be .
so what you were getting was this : your name here presents : my TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depending on the content , could ultimately blow up in your face , especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
but that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people watch these TED Talks ?
it &apos;s a lot .
that &apos;s just a working title , by the way .
so even with that caveat , I knew that someone would buy the naming rights .
now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , I wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certainty .
but in the new project that I &apos;m working on , my new film , we examine the world of marketing , advertising .
and as I said earlier , I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
you see , I had this idea for a movie .
what I want to do is make a film all about product placement , marketing and advertising , where the entire film is funded by product placement , marketing and advertising .
so the movie will be called &quot; The greatest movie Ever sold . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; The greatest movie Ever sold , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is branded from beginning to end -- from the above @-@ the @-@ title sponsor that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand X.
now this brand , the Qualcomm Stadium , the staples Center ...
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity -- forever .
and so the film explores this whole idea -- It &apos;s what ? in perpetuity , forever ?
I &apos;m a redundant person .
that was more for emphasis .
it was , &quot; In perpetuity . forever . &quot;
but not only are we going to have the brand X title sponsor , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every category we can in the film .
so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore ...
the greatest car you ever drove from &quot; The greatest movie Ever sold , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , courtesy of &quot; The greatest movie Ever sold . &quot;
so the idea is , beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ?
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
so that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
and I would love for CEG to help make it happen .
you know it &apos;s funny , because when I first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
I don &apos;t know how receptive people are going to be to it , though .
do you have a perspective -- I don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative connotation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
1.5 million .
I think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but I think it &apos;s certainly worth pursuing a couple big , really obvious brands .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of blithering idiots .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
the responses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
JK : both .
... Meaning not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? I need help .
I can help you .
okay .
awesome .
we &apos;ve gotta figure out which brands .
yeah .
when you look at the people you deal with ..
we &apos;ve got some places we can go .
turn the camera off .
I thought &quot; Turn the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; Let &apos;s have an off @-@ the @-@ record conversation . &quot;
turns out it really means , &quot; We want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
I was amazed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
and I was blown away , because I thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this intersection of new media and old media and the fractured media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new buzz @-@ worthy delivery vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the masses ?
no , that &apos;s what I thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal flaw , and that flaw was this .
actually no , that was not the flaw whatsoever .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
this would have been fine .
but what this image represents was the problem .
see , when you do a Google image search for transparency , this is --- This is one of the first images that comes up .
so I like the way you roll , Sergey Brin . no .
this is was the problem : transparency -- free from pretense or deceit ; easily detected or seen through ; readily understood ; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information , especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our CEO &apos;s say it .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like that odd , still @-@ screaming bear .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this odd country road .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
eating an entire bowl of Cool Whip .
that &apos;s very risky .
now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; No , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
see , when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &quot; Son , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
but with only one company , one agency willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because I knew John Bond and Richard Kirshenbaum for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own , I &apos;d have to cut out the middleman and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
so what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
I have friends who make great big , giant Hollywood films , and I have friends who make little independent films like I make .
and the friends of mine who make big , giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand partners that they have .
and then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; Well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant Hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; The greatest movie Ever sold . &quot;
so how specifically will we see Ban in the film ?
any time I &apos;m ready to go , any time I open up my medicine cabinet , you will see Ban deodorant .
while anytime I do an interview with someone , I can say , &quot; Are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
I want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
so we &apos;ll offer one of these fabulous scents .
whether it &apos;s a &quot; floral fusion &quot; or a &quot; Paradise winds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
we will have them geared for both male or female -- solid , roll @-@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
that &apos;s the two @-@ cent tour .
so now I can answer any of your questions and give you the five @-@ cent tour .
we are a smaller brand .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challenger brand .
so we don &apos;t have the budgets that other brands have .
so doing things like this -- you know , remind people about Ban -- is kind of why were interested in it .
what are the words that you would use to describe Ban ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a great question .
superior technology .
technology &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their armpit .
we talk about bold , fresh .
I think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really spins this category into the positive , versus &quot; fights odor and wetness . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how do we keep you fresher longer -- better freshness , more freshness , three times fresher .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and that &apos;s a multi @-@ million dollar corporation .
what about me ? what about a regular guy ?
I need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular Joes .
they need to tell me about my brand .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
um , my brand ?
I don &apos;t know .
I like really nice clothes .
80 &apos;s revival meets skater @-@ punk , unless it &apos;s laundry day .
all right , what is brand Gerry ?
unique .
I guess what kind of genre , style I am would be like dark glamor .
I like a lot of black colors , a lot of grays and stuff like that .
but usually I have an accessory , like sunglasses , or I like crystal and things like that too .
if Dan were a brand , he might be a classic convertible Mercedes Benz .
the brand that I am is , I would call it casual fly .
part hippie , part yogi , part Brooklyn girl -- I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m the pet guy .
I sell pet toys all over the country , all over the world .
so I guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my warped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
my brand is FedEx because I deliver the goods .
failed writer @-@ alcoholic brand .
is that something ?
I &apos;m a lawyer brand .
I &apos;m Tom .
well we can &apos;t all be brand Tom , but I do often find myself at the intersection of dark glamor and casual fly .
and what I realized is I needed an expert .
I needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand personality . &quot;
and so I found a company called Olson Zaltman in Pittsburg .
they &apos;ve helped companies like Nestle , Febreze , Hallmark discover that brand personality .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
you brought your pictures , right ?
I did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
so tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
these are the people who shape the way I look at the world .
tell me about this world .
this world ? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
all those things stemmed and started from one place , and for me they stemmed and started with my family in West Virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next one : this was the best day ever .
how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
it &apos;s like , who do I want to be ?
I like things that are different .
I like things that are weird . I like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
what is the machete ? what pupa stage are you in now ?
why is it important to reboot ? what does the red represent ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
... A little more about you that is not who you are .
what are some other metamorphoses that you &apos;ve had ?
... Doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of roller coaster are you on ?
EEEEEE ! no , thank you .
thanks for you patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
the first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinct , but complementary sides to your brand personality -- the Morgan Spurlock brand is a mindful / play brand .
those are juxtaposed very nicely together .
and I think there &apos;s almost a paradox with those .
and I think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both .
most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embrace those , and you actually turn them into positives for you , and it &apos;s a neat thing to see .
what other brands are like that ?
the first on here is the classic , Apple .
and you can see here too , Target , Wii , Mini from the Mini Coopers , and JetBlue .
now there &apos;s playful brands and mindful brands , those things that have come and gone , but a playful , mindful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
a playful , mindful brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?
are you an up attribute ? are you something that gets the blood flowing ?
or are you more of a down attribute ?
are you something that &apos;s a little more calm , reserved , conservative ?
up attributes are things like being playful , being fresh like the Fresh Prince , contemporary , adventurous , edgy or daring like Errol Flynn , nimble or agile , profane , domineering , magical or mystical like Gandalf .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
are you mindful , sophisticated like 007 ?
are you established , traditional , nurturing , protective , empathetic like the Oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , familiar , safe , secure , sacred , contemplative or wise like the Dalai Lama or Yoda ?
over the course of this film , we had 500 @-@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , mainly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
but we did get 17 brand partners who were willing to relinquish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as mindful and as playful as myself and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind .
they enabled us to tell the story about neuromarketing , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using MRI &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commercials as well as movie marketing .
we went to San Paulo where they have banned outdoor advertising .
in the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no billboards , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no fliers , nothing .
and we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash @-@ strapped schools all across America .
what &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that I &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or I &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where I &apos;ve interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
they cut out the middleman , they cut out their agencies and said , &quot; Maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
I &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
I &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
well , since the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival , let &apos;s take a look .
according to Burrelles , the movie premiered in January , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 900 million media impressions for this film .
that &apos;s literally covering just like a two and a half @-@ week period .
that &apos;s only online -- no print , no TV .
the film hasn &apos;t even been distributed yet .
it &apos;s not even online . it &apos;s not even streaming .
it &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part .
what I always believe is that if you take chances , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
I believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re pushing them more towards failure .
I believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse , then you &apos;re preparing your whole company to be reward challenged .
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them .
ultimately , moving forward , I think we have to embrace fear .
we &apos;ve got to put that bear in a cage .
embrace fear . embrace risk .
one big spoonful at a time , we have to embrace risk .
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
today , more than ever , a little honesty is going to go a long way .
and that being said , through honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; Embrace Transparency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at EMC , who for $ 7,100 bought the naming rights on eBay .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
EMC presents : &quot; embrace Transparency . &quot;
thank you very much , guys .
so , Morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened to that $ 7,100 ?
that is a fantastic question .
I have in my pocket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization , the Sapling Foundation -- a check for $ 7,100 to be applied toward my attendance for next year &apos;s TED .
my name is Amit .
and 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
and I grew up in India .
I had a great education -- I &apos;m not complaining -- but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
and so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
and while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
so , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
you look around at all these museums here .
you &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
two ways of going in -- very simple .
click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around , you have fun .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
you &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
keep going . have fun .
explore .
thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
so now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; The Harvesters &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
I see this plus sign .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all of the meta @-@ data information .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
and this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
so this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
and I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; what do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
so I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
you can zoom around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
and I was like , &quot; Hold on . that sounds interesting . &quot;
went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
and apparently it was quite popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best is yet to come -- so in a second .
so now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
so another one of my favorites , &quot; The Starry Night . &quot;
now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
but what if you want to see brush strokes ?
and what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
you zoom in . you really go in .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
this is &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
there &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
this is the real cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
very simply , you go in -- and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of zoom -- you can just zoom around .
this is &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; based in the National Gallery .
you can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
so I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
it doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
and the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s to supplement the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
there &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
and so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere , then we can plot our brain .
and for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have opted for one of these extremes , but I think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re mutually exclusive or anything .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so I consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
and really you do the same thing .
so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
I mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
and I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
he was just a toddler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
but I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
it &apos;d be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote down all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
and so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
this didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because I don &apos;t play with particles very often .
well , I play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and I &apos;ve never seen them .
I mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .
but it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechanics ?
I don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
and so I &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics .
so a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
so I made one .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
and that &apos;s this piece of metal I &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
this is a photograph of the object .
and here I &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . we &apos;re looking right there in the center .
and then here &apos;s a really , really big close @-@ up of the little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little chunk of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a diving board , and it &apos;s sticking out over a ledge .
and so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer , and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last stuff , I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool @-@ shaped hole underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition , but it needs a little help to do it .
here , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
I mean , when I &apos;m in an elevator all alone , I do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , scare them .
so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way .
the fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically , we &apos;re going to have to kick out all the other passengers .
and so that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air , and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero .
now , all alone in the elevator , the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted .
and so we measured its motion .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibrating , and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows .
and by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechanics .
so what I &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
so let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so in one case : all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
now it &apos;s only at precise times when they align .
the rest of the time they &apos;re delocalized .
that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places .
I think this is really cool .
really .
it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
I mean , this is just my logical side talking .
so imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
how would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space ?
there &apos;s one more part to the story .
it &apos;s when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
and so I had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
it &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , I decided that we needed to reconceptualize how we thought about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
but the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
so we could easily supply the world with dozens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
now this might sound preposterous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments .
but you know what you &apos;d run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction .
so it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those additions .
but you could go out someplace brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way .
so I proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : charter cities .
later I learned that at about this same time , Javier and Octavio were thinking about the challenge of reform in Honduras .
they knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year would leave to go to the United States , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in Honduras .
at one point , Javier said to Octavio , &quot; What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an embassy -- give some to the U.S. embassy ; give some to the Canadian embassy -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those embassy grounds that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis .
at the next regularly scheduled election , Pepe Lobo won in a landslide on a platform that promised reform , but reconciliation as well .
he asked Octavio to be his chief of staff .
meanwhile , I was getting ready to give a talk at TEDGlobal .
through a process of refinement , trial and error , a lot of user testing , I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from Guatemala sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk .
he showed it to Javier .
they called me .
they said , &quot; Let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so in December we met in Miami , in a hotel conference room .
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
and I used this slide showing how valuable the raw land is in a place like New York City : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , Octavio said , &quot; Paul , maybe we could watch the TEDTalk . &quot;
so the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms , a charter city is a place where you start with uninhabited land , a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to opt in , to go live under those rules or not .
so I was asked by the president of Honduras who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa and talk again on January fourth and fifth .
so I presented another fact @-@ filled lecture that included a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
this is a picture of Denver , and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
so I was trying to persuade the Hondurans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s more than 250 hundred @-@ thousand acres .
everybody applauded politely .
the faces in the audience were very serious and attentive .
the leader of the congress came up on stage and said , &quot; Professor Romer , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk .
I &apos;ve got it here on my laptop . &quot;
so I sat down , and they played the TEDTalk .
and it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in Honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away in the North .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
because the leaders in the government there in Honduras would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement , so everybody can trust that the charter really will be enforced .
and the insight of President Lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust .
we went and looked at a site .
this picture &apos;s from there .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly thereafter , on January 19th , they voted in the congress to amend their constitution to have a constitutional provision that allows for special development regions .
in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was 124 to one .
all parties , all factions in society , backed this .
to be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
on February 17th they passed it again with another vote of 114 to one .
immediately after that vote , on February 21st to the 24th , a delegation of about 30 Hondurans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
one is South Korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in South Korea -- bigger than downtown Boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the permits .
the other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is Singapore .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in China and are preparing the third .
so if you think about this practically , here &apos;s where we are .
they &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
they &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in , and also an external legal system .
one country has already volunteered to let its supreme court be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there .
there &apos;s designers and builders of cities who are very interested .
they even can bring with them some financing .
but the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of tenants .
there &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
around the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to move permanently someplace else right now .
there &apos;s a million a year who leave Latin America to go to the United States .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing .
sadly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in Honduras ?
or to build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
what kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends from Honduras asked me to say thank you , TED .
Hi . I &apos;m Kevin Allocca , I &apos;m the trends manager at YouTube , and I professionally watch YouTube videos .
it &apos;s true .
so we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- and when I was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
any one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Saturday .
but there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
three things : tastemakers , communities of participation and unexpectedness .
all right , let &apos;s go .
Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
Wooo !
Ohhhhh , wowwww !
last year , Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in Yosemite National Park .
in 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
but he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a viral video , Bear .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what you do when your name is Yosemite Mountain Bear .
and he had posted lots of nature videos in fact .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in January .
so what happened here ?
Jimmy Kimmel actually .
Jimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
it &apos;s Friday , Friday . gotta get down on Friday . everybody &apos;s looking forward to the weekend , weekend . Friday , Friday . gettin &apos; down on Friday . so you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
Rebecca Black &apos;s &quot; Friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
this is a chart of what it looked like .
and similar to &quot; Double Rainbow , &quot; it seems to have just sprouted up out of nowhere .
so what happened on this day ?
well it was a Friday , this is true .
and if you &apos;re wondering about those other spikes , those are also Fridays .
but what about this day , this one particular Friday ?
well Tosh.0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
Michael J. Nelson from mystery Science Theater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter .
but what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of tastemakers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , accelerating the process .
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
and now there are 10,000 parodies of &quot; Friday &quot; on YouTube .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
unlike the one @-@ way entertainment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
so &quot; Nyan Cat &quot; is a looped animation with looped music .
it &apos;s this , just like this .
it &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
and if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three @-@ hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
even cats were watching this video .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this techie , geeky Internet culture .
there were remixes .
someone made an old timey version .
and then it went international .
an entire remix community sprouted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
who could have predicted &quot; Double Rainbow &quot; or Rebecca Black or &quot; Nyan Cat ? &quot;
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
in a world where over two days of video get uploaded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
when a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy protesting bicycle fines in New York City , I admit I wasn &apos;t very interested .
so I got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
by being totally surprising and humorous , Casey Niestat got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
and so it all brings us to one big question ...
what does this mean ?
Ohhhh .
what does it mean ?
Tastemakers , creative participating communities , complete unexpectedness , these are characteristics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defines the popularity .
I mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , Justin Bieber , got his start on YouTube .
no one has to green @-@ light your idea .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
and these are not characteristics of old media , and they &apos;re barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four @-@ year @-@ old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
this is not a finished story .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
he is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
imagine him as the communists enter Saigon , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
he retreated into silence .
he died broken by history .
he is my grandfather .
I never knew him in real life .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
the next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
my mother , Mai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in Australia .
it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
so after a four @-@ year saga that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel .
all the adults knew the risks .
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
if we were captured , first my sister and I , then she and my grandmother would drink .
my first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
I don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times , but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
but I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple I tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in Melbourne .
and the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
we settled in Footscray , a working @-@ class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
unlike the settled middle @-@ class suburbs , whose existence I was oblivious of , there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray .
the smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
and the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications .
we were poor .
all the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secondhand .
two pairs of stockings for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
a school uniform down to the ankles , because it had to last for six years .
and there were rare but searing chants of &quot; slit @-@ eye &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; Asian , go home . &quot;
go home to where ?
something stiffened inside me .
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; I will bypass you . &quot;
my mother , my sister and I slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
my mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her .
she opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business .
and the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
grants and sponsors were sought .
centers were established .
I lived in parallel worlds .
in one , I was the classic Asian student , relentless in the demands that I made on myself .
in the other , I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious , tragically scarred by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
but so many over the years were helped .
and for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was chosen as the young Australian of the year .
and I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
tan Le , anonymous Footscray resident , was now Tan Le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
I didn &apos;t know the protocols .
I didn &apos;t know how to use the cutlery .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
no had never been an option .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised .
and the more candidly I spoke , the more I was asked to speak .
I met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
and even though I finished my degree , I realized I could not settle into a career in law .
there had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
and I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province .
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged .
there was an energy there , an implacable optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .
so I followed my hunches .
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was an irresistible challenge .
for a year we were penniless .
at the end of each day , I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
we worked well into each night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip .
my hunches again .
three months later I had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
before I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered .
life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother raised her alone .
at 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
&quot; it can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Melbourne .
I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
I knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother phoned minutes later .
a few days later , we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
at midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you have not let it go . &quot;
if there is a sinew in our family , it runs through the women .
given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us .
defeat would have come too easily .
now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
yet I am afraid of privilege , of ease , of entitlement .
can I give them a bow in their lives , dipping bravely into each wave , the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarantees nothing ?
I don &apos;t know .
but if I could give it and still see them safely through , I would .
and also , Tan &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
I &apos;m here to share my photography .
or is it photography ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
so I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
when I say realism , I mean photo @-@ realism .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two @-@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
so I think the basics are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three @-@ dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three @-@ dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and I see the same process with combining photographs .
it &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
as you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
but combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
and these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
so by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
so here &apos;s another example .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
so for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
the shores are from a different location .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
and yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
so to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well planned .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .
I would like to talk to you about why many e @-@ health projects fail .
and I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at Radboud University is we appointed a chief listening officer .
not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , &quot; What &apos;s up ?
how could we help you ? &quot;
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e @-@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
this is my WiFi scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got one knob , on / off .
and every morning I hop on it .
and yes , I &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
and I put my challenge on 95 kg .
but the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever I hop on , it sends my data through Google Health as well .
and it &apos;s collected by my general practitioner as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support or something like it , but also looking backward .
but there &apos;s another thing .
as some of you might know , I &apos;ve got more than 4,000 followers on Twitter .
so every morning I hop on my WiFi scale and before I &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you need a light lunch today , Lucien . &quot;
but that &apos;s the nicest thing that could happen , since this is peer pressure , peer pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smoking in patients .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
and this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be captain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubled demand and things like that .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd @-@ sourcing .
and one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
we &apos;ve all got navigation controls in our car .
we maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cellphone .
we know perfectly where all the ATMs are about the city of Maastricht .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
but where would be the nearest AED to help this patient ?
we asked around and nobody knew .
nobody knew where the nearest life @-@ saving AED was to be obtained right now .
so what we did , we crowdsourced The Netherlands .
we set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; If you see an AED , please submit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 AEDs already in The Netherlands already have been submitted .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
and we built an iPad application .
we made an application for Layar , augmented reality , to find these AEDs .
and whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses , you can use your iPhone , and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone , to find the nearest AED which can save lives .
and as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as AED4EU , which is what the product is called , but also AED4US .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
and &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleague universities , to help us to find and work and act like a hub to crowd @-@ source all these AEDs all around the world .
that whenever you &apos;re on holiday and somebody collapses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
the other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us validate these AEDs .
these might be courier services or cable guys for instance , just to see whether the AED that &apos;s submitted still is in place .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
thank you .
today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
now I work in the solar technology industry .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crowd @-@ sourcing .
it &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
huh . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
we &apos;ll just -- we can just skip -- I &apos;ll just skip through the video instead ...
no .
this is not ...
okay .
solar technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
the program is called Code for America , and it &apos;s a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks .
we select a few fellows every year and we have them work with city governments .
instead of sending them off into the Third World , we send them into the wilds of City Hall .
and there they make great apps , they work with city staffers .
but really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
so meet Al .
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston .
here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fires when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
we had a team of fellows in Boston last year through the Code for America program .
they were there in February , and it snowed a lot in February last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants .
but one fellow in particular , a guy named Erik Michaels @-@ Ober , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks right in front of these things .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al .
and if you don &apos;t , someone can steal it from you .
so it &apos;s got cute little game dynamics on it .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year .
but it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
it &apos;s spreading virally .
there &apos;s a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .
it &apos;s very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
so he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
and then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains .
and Chicago just rolled it out to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and this has spread just frictionlessly , organically , naturally .
if you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
there is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
it suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the Internet itself .
and that means permissionless , it means open , it means generative .
and that &apos;s important .
but what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tackling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an ossified institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
it &apos;s not just Code for America fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up on government .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not complaining about it , they &apos;re fixing it .
and these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
and that &apos;s that when you strip away all your feelings about politics and the line at the DMV and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of Tim O &apos;Reilly , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
now a lot of people have given up on government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , I would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
politics is not changing ; government is changing .
and because government ultimately derives its power from us -- remember &quot; We the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
now I didn &apos;t know very much about government when I started this program .
and like a lot of people , I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about opossums .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
it &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 311 in your city .
if you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an opossum stuck in your house .
so Scott gets this call .
he types &quot; opossum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
he doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . he starts with animal control .
and finally , he says , &quot; Look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
so that worked . so booya for Scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the opossums .
Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
it has an app , a Web and mobile app , called Citizens Connect .
now we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work of the very smart people at the Office of New Urban mechanics in Boston .
so one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; opossum in my trashcan . can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
how do I get this removed ? &quot;
but what happens with Citizens Connect is different .
so Scott was speaking person @-@ to @-@ person .
but on Citizens Connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
and the next report we got said , &quot; I walked over to this location , found the trashcan behind the house .
opossum ? check . living ? Yep .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
Goodnight sweet opossum . &quot;
pretty simple .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crowd @-@ sourcing game .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and I don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
I &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
it connected those two people .
and it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
we call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
now how many times have we elected a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected -- and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six @-@ inch layer on top .
and what &apos;s under that is what we call bureaucracy .
and we say that word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re disempowering ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
so that &apos;s OccupytheSEC movement has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very detailed 325 @-@ page report that &apos;s a response to the SEC &apos;s request for comment on the Financial reform Bill .
that &apos;s not being politically active , that &apos;s being bureaucratically active .
now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
we can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
the good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally reframe the function of government in a way that can actually scale by strengthening civil society .
and there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so I am , begrudgingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
so when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
that could be shoveling out a hydrant , pulling a weed , turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it .
and certainly , we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along , and many people do .
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
so the question I have for all of you here : when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
so I &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
this is just a random slide that I picked out of my file .
what I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
this happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of RISC microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi @-@ log curve .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in performance scale .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi @-@ log curves .
something really weird is going on here .
and that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because I &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
now why do we draw technology curves in semi @-@ log curves ?
well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
they sort of go like this .
and they don &apos;t tell us much .
now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a semi @-@ log curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
but when something like this happens , things are qualitatively changing .
so if transportation technology was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a taxi cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds .
it &apos;s not moving like that .
and there &apos;s nothing precedented in the history of technology development of this kind of self @-@ feeding growth where you go by orders of magnitude every few years .
now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
things just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
one of two things is going to happen .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical S @-@ curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
that &apos;s about all it can do .
now I &apos;m an optimist , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
if so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
we &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
what &apos;s that new state that the world is heading toward ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
now when I was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
it &apos;s about as far as we go out .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
so what I would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
now in order to do that I &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
so the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth .
so I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
so if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , sterile hunk of rock with a lot of chemicals floating around on it .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and I think that there &apos;s theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
and those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense , those little drops of oil .
but now those drops of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
in fact , the drops that were different in a way that caused them to be better at incorporating chemicals around them , grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more .
so those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
somehow by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA .
so in other words , they worked out , in this mindless sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get copied .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
in fact , one of the things that I did just for amusement purposes is we can now write things in this code .
and I &apos;ve got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder , which I try not to let the security people see at airports .
but this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amplified it 10 to the 22 times .
so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , I have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
if I had really been a egotist , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
so what was the next step ?
writing down the DNA was an interesting step .
and that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange DNA .
now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were synergistic .
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution .
now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community together on one string of DNA .
and so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
and at that stage , we have multi @-@ cellular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organism .
and in fact , we &apos;re such a multi @-@ cellular community .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
so these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organism .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
these communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
and those are the neural structures .
so neurons are the information processing apparatus that those communities of cells built up .
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned evolutionarily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
so that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution .
because evolution could now happen within an individual .
it could happen in learning time scales .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
and for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
it &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
here I have a very complicated , messy , confused idea in my head .
I &apos;m sitting here making grunting sounds basically , and hopefully constructing a similar messy , confused idea in your head that bears some analogy to it .
but we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
and so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstracting out .
we &apos;re going through the same levels that multi @-@ cellular organisms have gone through -- abstracting out our methods of recording , presenting , processing information .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
telephony , computers , videotapes , CD @-@ ROMs and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for handling that information .
and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
and you saw Ty &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Convolution program right before your eyes .
so now we &apos;ve speeded up the time scales once again .
so the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
the process is feeding on itself and becoming , I guess , autocatalytic is the word for it -- when something reinforces its rate of change .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of curve .
we &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
now I design computers for a living , and I know that the mechanisms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
so right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
I don &apos;t know what every transistor in the connection machine does .
there are billions of them .
instead , what I do and what the designers at Thinking Machines do is we think at some level of abstraction and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much farther and faster than we could ever do .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
say , &quot; Computer , would you please make a hundred million random sequences of instructions .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted . &quot;
so in other words , I define what I wanted .
let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
and I say , &quot; Computer , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
save those . kill off the rest .
and now let &apos;s reproduce the ones that sorted numbers the best .
and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines , and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs .
so I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
say , &quot; Please repeat that process . &quot;
score them again .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
so I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
at the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand .
now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work .
I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
they &apos;re obscure , weird programs .
but they do the job .
and in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
I was riding in a 747 with Marvin Minsky once , and he pulls out this card and says , &quot; Oh look . look at this .
it says , &apos; This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; doesn &apos;t that make you feel confident ? &quot;
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
so we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
so in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
we &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
so it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why I think it seems so confusing .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analogous to when single @-@ celled organisms were turning into multi @-@ celled organisms .
so we &apos;re the amoebas and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re right at that point of transition .
but I think that there really is something coming along after us .
I think it &apos;s very haughty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
and I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
so lunch is coming along , and I think I will stop at that point , before I get selected out .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
I spend most of my time in jails , in prisons , on death row .
I spend most of my time in very low @-@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hopelessness .
and being here at TED and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very energizing to me .
and one of the things that &apos;s emerged in my short time here is that TED has an identity .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
and sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
and I mention that because I think identity is really important .
and we &apos;ve had some fantastic presentations .
and I think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .
and so I want to talk about the power of identity .
and I didn &apos;t learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that I do .
I actually learned about this from my grandmother .
I grew up in a house that was the traditional African American home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the end of every argument in our family .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
she was the daughter of people who were actually enslaved .
her parents were born in slavery in Virginia in the 1840 &apos;s .
she was born in the 1880 &apos;s and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
when I would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hugs .
and she &apos;d squeeze me so tight I could barely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
and an hour or two later , if I saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; Bryan , do you still feel me hugging you ? &quot;
and if I said , &quot; No , &quot; she &apos;d assault me again , and if I said , &quot; Yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of her 10 kids .
and sometimes when I would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
and I remember , when I was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
and at first I thought we were playing a game .
and I would look at her and I &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
and after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; Come on , Bryan . you and I are going to have a talk . &quot;
and I remember this just like it happened yesterday .
I never will forget it .
she took me out back and she said , &quot; Bryan , I &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what I tell you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , Mama . &quot;
she said , &quot; Now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; I said , &quot; Sure . &quot;
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to know I &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; I think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; I think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
I will never forget it .
and then she said , &quot; I just need you to promise me three things , Bryan . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , Mama . &quot;
she said , &quot; The first thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; That &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
well I adored my mom , so I said , &quot; Yes , Mama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; The second thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
and I thought about it and I said , &quot; Yes , Mama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
then finally she said , &quot; The third thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink alcohol . &quot;
well I was nine years old , so I said , &quot; Yes , Mama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
I grew up in the country in the rural South , and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
when I was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six @-@ pack of beer -- I don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he grabbed me and my sister and we went out in the woods .
and we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we crazily did .
and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
I said , &quot; No , no , no . that &apos;s okay . you all go ahead . I &apos;m not going to have any beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; Come on . we &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
I had some , your sister had some . have some beer . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t feel right about that . y &apos;all go ahead . y &apos;all go ahead . &quot;
and then my brother started staring at me .
he said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? have some beer . &quot;
then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; Oh , I hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation Mama had with you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; Oh , Mama tells all the grandkids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
I was devastated .
and I &apos;m going to admit something to you .
I &apos;m going to tell you something I probably shouldn &apos;t .
I know this might be broadcast broadly .
but I &apos;m 52 years old , and I &apos;m going to admit to you that I &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
I don &apos;t say that because I think that &apos;s virtuous ; I say that because there is power in identity .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
we can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
when I thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
my male uncles died of alcohol @-@ related diseases .
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
well I &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 people in jails and prisons .
today , there are 2.3 million .
the United States now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
we have seven million people on probation and parole .
and mass incarceration , in my judgment , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
one out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail , in prison , on probation or parole .
in urban communities across this country -- Los Angeles , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on probation or parole .
our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be distorting around race , they &apos;re also distorted by poverty .
we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
wealth , not culpability , shapes outcomes .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we &apos;ve been disconnected .
it &apos;s interesting to me .
we &apos;re looking at some very interesting developments in our work .
my state of Alabama , like a number of states , actually permanently disenfranchises you if you have a criminal conviction .
right now in Alabama 34 percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
we &apos;re actually projecting in another 10 years the level of disenfranchisement will be as high as it &apos;s been since prior to the passage of the Voting Rights Act .
and there is this stunning silence .
I represent children .
a lot of my clients are very young .
the United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 13 @-@ year @-@ old children to die in prison .
we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country .
and we &apos;re actually doing some litigation .
the only country in the world .
I represent people on death row .
it &apos;s interesting , this question of the death penalty .
in many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people deserve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve committed ?
and that &apos;s a very sensible question .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
death penalty in America is defined by error .
for every nine people who have been executed , we &apos;ve actually identified one innocent person who &apos;s been exonerated and released from death row .
a kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people innocent .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
but somehow we can insulate ourselves from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these issues .
I talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
and it &apos;s interesting , when I teach my students about African American history , I tell them about slavery .
I tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to World War II .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for African Americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
in many communities , people had to worry about being lynched .
they had to worry about being bombed .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; Mr. Stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they tell me to say , &quot; No , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done historically .
we &apos;re constantly running into each other .
we &apos;re constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
we have a hard time talking about race , and I believe it &apos;s because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
in South Africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
in Rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; Well you know it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
he said , &quot; We don &apos;t have the death penalty in Germany .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in Germany . &quot;
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; There &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
it would be unconscionable for us to , in an intentional and deliberate way , set about executing people . &quot;
and I thought about that .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was executing people , especially if they were disproportionately Jewish ?
I couldn &apos;t bear it .
it would be unconscionable .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the Old South , we execute people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
well I believe that our identity is at risk .
that when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , those realities are shadowed by suffering , abuse , degradation , marginalization .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to TED .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
and it &apos;s that mind @-@ heart connection that I believe compels us to not just be attentive to all the bright and dazzly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
Vaclav Havel , the great Czech leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . &quot;
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in .
there is no disconnect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exclusion , to unfairness , to injustice .
now I will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
it will get to you .
I had the great privilege , when I was a young lawyer , of meeting Rosa Parks .
and Ms. Parks used to come back to Montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her dearest friends , these older women , Johnnie Carr who was the organizer of the Montgomery bus boycott -- amazing African American woman -- and Virginia Durr , a white woman , whose husband , Clifford Durr , represented Dr. King .
and these women would get together and just talk .
and every now and then Ms. Carr would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Bryan , Ms. Parks is coming to town . we &apos;re going to get together and talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
and I &apos;d say , &quot; Yes , Ma &apos;am , I do . &quot;
and she &apos;d say , &quot; Well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen .
it would be so energizing and so empowering .
and one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours Ms. Parks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Bryan , tell me what the Equal Justice Initiative is .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and I began giving her my rap .
I said , &quot; Well we &apos;re trying to challenge injustice .
we &apos;re trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
we &apos;re trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
we &apos;re trying to end life without parole sentences for children .
we &apos;re trying to do something about the death penalty .
we &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
we &apos;re trying to end mass incarceration . &quot;
I gave her my whole rap , and when I finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; Mmm mmm mmm . &quot;
she said , &quot; That &apos;s going to make you tired , tired , tired . &quot;
and that &apos;s when Ms. Carr leaned forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be brave , brave , brave . &quot;
and I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more courageous .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
I &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do .
it &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
I &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
I think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
I think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to them , they &apos;re not just a thief .
I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
and because of that there &apos;s this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
I also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won &apos;t be judged by our design , we won &apos;t be judged by our intellect and reason .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated .
because it &apos;s in that Nexus that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
I sometimes get out of balance . I &apos;ll end with this story .
I sometimes push too hard .
I do get tired , as we all do .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and I &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
and I go to the jail and I see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been certified to stand trial as an adult .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
how can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but I see this kid .
and I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well gosh , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
yeah , Bryan , the judge has some magic power .
you should ask for some of that .
and because I was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , I started working on a motion .
and I had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
and I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; motion to try my poor , 14 @-@ year @-@ old black male client like a privileged , white 75 @-@ year @-@ old corporate executive . &quot;
and I put in my motion that there was prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct and judicial misconduct .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all misconduct .
and the next morning , I woke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ?
and to my horror , not only had I written it , but I had sent it to court .
a couple months went by , and I had just forgotten all about it .
and I finally decided , oh gosh , I &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
and I got in my car and I went to this courthouse .
and I was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
and I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the courthouse .
and as I was walking up the steps of this courthouse , there was an older black man who was the janitor in this courthouse .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; You &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; I said , &quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
and he whispered in my ear .
he said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and I have to tell you , it was energizing .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
well I went into the courtroom .
and as soon as I walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
he said , &quot; Mr. Stevenson , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , sir . I did . &quot; and we started arguing .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
I had written these crazy things .
and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
and before I knew it , the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
and out of the corner of my eye , I could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
and he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this holler .
he kept pacing back and forth .
and finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the courtroom and sat down behind me , almost at counsel table .
about 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , &quot; Jimmy , what are you doing in this courtroom ? &quot;
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , &quot; I came into this courtroom to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . &quot;
I &apos;ve come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is long , but it bends toward justice .
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , I &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
thank you very much .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
well there are opportunities all around us .
if you live in the state of California , for example , there &apos;s a referendum coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to redirect some of the money we spend on the politics of punishment .
for example , here in California we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all homicide cases don &apos;t result in arrest .
56 percent of all rape cases don &apos;t result .
so there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
and I think that opportunity exists all around us .
there &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades .
and part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased incarceration rates .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
that &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
and we got carried away with the rhetoric of punishment .
and so we have three strikes laws that put people in prison forever for stealing a bicycle , for low @-@ level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victimized .
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime , not do less .
and I think our current punishment philosophy does nothing for no one .
and I think that &apos;s the orientation that we have to change .
Bryan , you &apos;ve struck a massive chord here .
you &apos;re an inspiring person .
thank you so much for coming to TED . thank you .
threats , in the wake of Bin Laden &apos;s death , have spiked .
famine in Somalia . police pepper spray .
vicious cartels . announcer Five : caustic cruise lines .
societal decay . 65 dead .
tsunami warning . cyber @-@ attacks .
drug war . mass destruction . tornado .
recession . default . doomsday . Egypt . Syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
Oh , my God .
so those are just a few of the clips I collected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
and there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
now the amygdala is our early warning detector , our danger detector .
it sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us .
so given a dozen news stories , we will preferentially look at the negative news .
and that old newspaper saying , &quot; If it bleeds it leads , &quot; is very true .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
but perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
perhaps instead , it &apos;s the distortions brought to us of what &apos;s really going on .
perhaps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
now I &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extinction , water and energy shortage -- we surely do .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance , but ultimately we knock them down .
so let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of 10 .
add to that the cost of food , electricity , transportation , communication have dropped 10 to 1,000 @-@ fold .
Steve Pinker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
and Charles Kenny that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
think of this , in America today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television , mobile phones , air conditioning and cars .
the wealthiest robber barons of the last century , the emperors on this planet , could have never dreamed of such luxuries .
underpinning much of this is technology , and of late , exponentially growing technologies .
my good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that becomes an information technology jumps on this curve , on Moore &apos;s Law , and experiences price performance doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is Moore &apos;s Law over the last hundred years .
I want you to notice two things from this curve .
number one , how smooth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
and also , even though it &apos;s plotted on a log curve on the left , it &apos;s curving upwards .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
and on this curve , riding on Moore &apos;s Law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .
cloud computing , what my friends at Autodesk call infinite computing ; sensors and networks ; robotics ; 3D printing , which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet ; synthetic biology ; fuels , vaccines and foods ; digital medicine ; nanomaterials ; and A.I.
I mean , how many of you saw the winning of Jeopardy by IBM &apos;s Watson ?
I mean , that was epic .
in fact , I scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper I could .
and I love this : &quot; Watson Vanquishes Human opponents . &quot;
Jeopardy &apos;s not an easy game .
it &apos;s about the nuance of human language .
and imagine if you would A.I. &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cellphone .
four years ago here at TED , Ray Kurzweil and I started a new university called Singularity University .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
30 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
when I think about creating abundance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant .
you see , scarcity is contextual , and technology is a resource @-@ liberating force .
let me give you an example .
so this is a story of Napoleon III in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the dude on the left .
he invited over to dinner the king of Siam .
all of Napoleon &apos;s troops were fed with silver utensils , Napoleon himself with gold utensils .
but the King of Siam , he was fed with aluminum utensils .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and platinum .
it &apos;s the reason that the tip of the Washington Monument is made of aluminum .
you see , even though aluminum is 8.3 percent of the Earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
it &apos;s all bound by oxygen and silicates .
but then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw @-@ away mentality .
so let &apos;s project this analogy going forward .
we think about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is bathed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
16 terawatts of energy hits the Earth &apos;s surface every 88 minutes .
it &apos;s not about being scarce , it &apos;s about accessibility .
and there &apos;s good news here .
for the first time , this year the cost of solar @-@ generated electricity is 50 percent that of diesel @-@ generated electricity in India -- 8.8 rupees versus 17 rupees .
the cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sunny parts of the United States , solar electricity will be six cents a kilowatt hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
and if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .
now we talk about water wars .
do you remember when Carl Sagan turned the Voyager spacecraft back towards the Earth , in 1990 after it just passed Saturn ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
&quot; a Pale Blue Dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
yes , 97.5 percent is saltwater , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
and there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
there &apos;s nanotechnology coming on , nanomaterials .
and the conversation I had with Dean Kamen this morning , one of the great DIY innovators , I &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission to do so -- his technology called slingshot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dorm room refrigerator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source -- saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- at less than two cents a liter .
the chairman of Coca @-@ Cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world .
and if that pans out , which I have every confidence it will , Coca @-@ Cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet .
this is the kind of innovation , empowered by this technology , that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in cellphones .
my goodness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent penetration of cellphones in the developing world by the end of 2013 .
think about it , that a Masai warrior on a cellphone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile comm than President Reagan did 25 years ago .
and if they &apos;re on a smartphone on Google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton did 15 years ago .
they &apos;re living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted .
better than that , the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- GPS , HD video and still images , libraries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dematerializing and demonetizing into your cellphone .
probably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the Pike in health .
last month , I had the pleasure of announcing with Qualcomm Foundation something called the $ 10 million Qualcomm tricorder X Prize .
we &apos;re challenging teams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got A.I. , you can cough on it , you can do a finger blood prick .
and to win , it needs to be able to diagnose you better than a team of board @-@ certified doctors .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease burden and 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
when this device sequences an RNA or DNA virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the CDC and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance .
I call it the rising billion .
so the white lines here are population .
we just passed the seven billion mark on Earth .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy .
in 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
by 2020 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion Internet users .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
what will these people want ?
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
and rather than having economic shutdown , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic injection ever .
these people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy .
and they will get healthier by using the tricorder , and they &apos;ll become better educated by using the Khan Academy , and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infinite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
so what could three billion rising , healthy , educated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
how about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
what about giving the oppressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
what about contributions we can &apos;t even predict ?
the one thing I &apos;ve learned at the X Prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
it &apos;s a game called Foldit .
it came out of the University of Washington in Seattle .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
and it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
and up until now , it &apos;s been a supercomputer problem .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
and it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers .
and when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein folder in the world , it wasn &apos;t an MIT professor , it wasn &apos;t a CalTech student , it was a person from England , from Manchester , a woman who , during the day , was an executive assistant at a rehab clinic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein folder .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
we have the passion of the DIY innovator .
we have the capital of the techno @-@ philanthropist .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
thank you .
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
and I think it starts with one physician , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe I &apos;ve been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
before I actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
Hey , why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the World Series .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; moneyball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
I &apos;m going to focus on one stat that I hope a lot of you have heard of .
it &apos;s called batting average .
so we talk about a 300 , a batter who bats 300 .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of 10 at bats .
that means hit the ball into the outfield , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the runner was safe .
three times out of 10 .
do you know what they call a 300 hitter in Major League Baseball ?
good , really good , maybe an all @-@ star .
do you know what they call a 400 baseball hitter ?
that &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every 10 .
legendary -- as in Ted Williams legendary -- the last Major League Baseball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where I &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I &apos;m going to talk to you about .
suppose you have appendicitis and you &apos;re referred to a surgeon who &apos;s batting 400 on appendectomies .
somehow this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blockages in two coronary arteries and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist who &apos;s batting 200 on angioplasties .
but , but , you know what ?
she &apos;s doing a lot better this year . she &apos;s on the comeback trail .
and she &apos;s hitting a 257 .
somehow this isn &apos;t working .
but I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think a batting average for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner or an orthopedic surgeon , an OBGYN , a paramedic is supposed to be ?
1,000 , very good .
now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physician or paramedic is supposed to bat .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the admonition , be perfect .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
and that was the message that I absorbed when I was in med school .
I was an obsessive compulsive student .
in high school , a classmate once said that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test .
and so I did .
and I studied in my little garret at the nurses &apos; residence at Toronto General Hospital , not far from here .
and I memorized everything .
I memorized in my anatomy class the origins and exertions of every muscle , every branch of every artery that came off the aorta , differential diagnoses obscure and common .
I even knew the differential diagnosis in how to classify renal tubular acidosis .
and all the while , I was amassing more and more knowledge .
and I did well , I graduated with honors , cum laude .
and I came out of medical school with the impression that if I memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immunize me against making mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until I met Mrs. Drucker .
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department of the hospital where I was working .
at the time I was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation .
and it was my job , when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult , to see that patient in emerg .
and to report back to my attending .
and I saw Mrs. Drucker , and she was breathless .
and when I listened to her , she was making a wheezy sound .
and when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope , I could hear crackly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in congestive heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shortness of breath .
and that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnosis to make .
I made it and I set to work treating her .
I gave her aspirin . I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart .
I gave her medications that we call diuretics , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
and I felt really good .
and that &apos;s when I made my first mistake ; I sent her home .
actually , I made two more mistakes .
I sent her home without speaking to my attending .
I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my attending and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
and he knew her , he would have been able to furnish additional information about her .
maybe I did it for a good reason .
maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high @-@ maintenance resident .
maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attending &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
the second mistake that I made was worse .
in sending her home , I disregarded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; Goldman , not a good idea . don &apos;t do this . &quot;
in fact , so lacking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said very matter @-@ of @-@ factly , &quot; Yeah , I think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
I can remember that like it was yesterday .
so I signed the discharge papers , and an ambulance came , paramedics came to take her home .
and I went back to my work on the wards .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach .
but I carried on with my work .
and at the end of the day , I packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don &apos;t usually do .
I walked through the emergency department on my way home .
and it was there that another nurse , not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before , but another nurse , said three words to me that are the three words that most emergency physicians I know dread .
others in medicine dread them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emergency medicine because we see patients so fleetingly .
the three words are : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nurse asked matter @-@ of @-@ factly .
&quot; well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that tone of voice .
well she was back all right .
she was back and near death .
about an hour after she had arrived home , after I &apos;d sent her home , she collapsed and her family called 911 and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
and she was barely breathing and she was blue .
and the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops .
they gave her medications to raise her blood pressure .
they put her on a ventilator .
and I was shocked and shaken to the core .
and I went through this roller coaster , because after they stabilized her , she went to the intensive care unit , and I hoped against hope that she would recover .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
she had irreversible brain damage .
and the family gathered .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they resigned themselves to what was happening .
and at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- Mrs. Drucker , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
they say you never forget the names of those who die .
and that was my first time to be acquainted with that .
over the next few weeks , I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
you know that healthy kind , when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get busted and then your best friend confronts you and you have terrible discussions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you and you say , I &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
and you make amends and you never make that mistake again .
that &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
the unhealthy shame I &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and it was what I was feeling .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my attending ; he was a doll .
he talked to the family , and I &apos;m quite sure that he smoothed things over and made sure that I didn &apos;t get sued .
and I kept asking myself these questions .
why didn &apos;t I ask my attending ? why did I send her home ?
and then at my worst moments : why did I make such a stupid mistake ?
why did I go into medicine ?
slowly but surely , it lifted .
I began to feel a bit better .
and on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered , maybe I could feel better again .
and I made myself a bargain that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
and they did .
and I went back to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later I was an attending in the emergency department at a community hospital just north of Toronto , and I saw a 25 year @-@ old man with a sore throat .
it was busy , I was in a bit of a hurry .
he kept pointing here .
I looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
and I gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his throat .
and two days later I came to do my next emergency shift , and that &apos;s when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? &quot;
well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a strep throat .
he had a potentially life @-@ threatening condition called epiglottitis .
you can Google it , but it &apos;s an infection , not of the throat , but of the upper airway , and it can actually cause the airway to close .
and fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
he was placed on intravenous antibiotics and he recovered after a few days .
and I went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
twice in one emergency shift , I missed appendicitis .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
now in both cases , I didn &apos;t send them home and I don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
one I thought had a kidney stone .
I ordered a kidney X @-@ ray . when it turned out to be normal , my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him and asked my colleague to reassess him .
and he did and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant , called the surgeons .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
but each time , they were gnawing at me , eating at me .
and I &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total B.S.
some of my doozies have been in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
here &apos;s the problem : if I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can &apos;t find the still @-@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ?
how can I teach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if I were to walk into a room -- like right now , I have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
Oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
if I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I &apos;ve just told you right now , I probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really uncomfortable , somebody would crack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
and in fact , if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , I &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
that &apos;s the system that we have .
it &apos;s a complete denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physicians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
in my 20 years or so of medical broadcasting and journalism , I &apos;ve made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors to learn everything I can , from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star to my show &quot; White coat , Black Art . &quot;
and what I &apos;ve learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
we work in a system where errors happen every day , where one in 10 medications are either the wrong medication given in hospital or at the wrong dosage , where hospital @-@ acquired infections are getting more and more numerous , causing havoc and death .
in this country , as many as 24,000 Canadians die of preventable medical errors .
in the United States , the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000 .
in both cases , these are gross underestimates , because we really aren &apos;t ferreting out the problem as we should .
and here &apos;s the thing .
in a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have our cognitive biases , so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
now take the same patient with chest pain , make them moist and garrulous and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath , and suddenly my history is laced with contempt .
I don &apos;t take the same history .
I &apos;m not a robot ; I don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
and my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
so if you take the system , as I was taught , and weed out all the error @-@ prone health professionals , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
and you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
on my show , on &quot; White coat , Black Art , &quot; I made it a habit of saying , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; I would say to everybody from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; What about yours ? &quot; and I would point the microphone towards them .
and their pupils would dilate , they would recoil , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; Look , don &apos;t make the same mistake I did . &quot;
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
the redefined physician is human , knows she &apos;s human , accepts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
she shares her experience with others .
she &apos;s supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
and she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a gotcha way , but in a loving , supportive way so that everybody can benefit .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
so the system is evolving to create backups that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inevitably make and also fosters in a loving , supportive way places where everybody who is observing in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is rewarded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re rewarded for coming clean .
my name is Brian Goldman .
I am a redefined physician .
I &apos;m human . I make mistakes .
I &apos;m sorry about that , but I strive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people .
I still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but I can live with that .
and let me close with three words of my own : I do remember .
in the 1980s in the communist Eastern Germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
you had to register a sample sheet of text out of the typewriter .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
but today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser printer from any major laser printer manufacturer and print a page , that page will end up having slight yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your printer .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
if we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
we have three main groups .
we have online criminals .
like here , we have Mr. Dimitry Golubov from the city of Kiev in Ukraine .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
we actually have several cases of millionaires online , multimillionaires , who made money with their attacks .
here &apos;s Vladimir Tsastsin form Tartu in Estonia .
this is Alfred Gonzalez .
this is Stephen Watt .
this is Bjorn Sundin .
this is Matthew Anderson , Tariq Al @-@ Daour and so on and so on .
these guys make their fortunes online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like banking trojans to steal money from our bank accounts while we do online banking , or with keyloggers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
the U.S. Secret Service , two months ago , froze the Swiss bank account of Mr. Sam Jain right here , and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
Mr. Jain himself is on the loose ; nobody knows where he is .
and I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
the second major group of attackers that we are watching today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
groups like Anonymous have risen up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
so those are the three main attackers : criminals who do it for the money , hacktivists like Anonymous doing it for the protest , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
and then we look at cases like what happened in DigiNotar .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
DigiNotar is a certificate Authority from The Netherlands -- or actually , it was .
it was running into bankruptcy last fall because they were hacked into .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
and I asked last week in a meeting with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found plausible that people died because of the DigiNotar hack .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
well DigiNotar is a C.A.
they sell certificates .
what do you do with certificates ?
well you need a certificate if you have a website that has https , SSL encrypted services , services like Gmail .
now we all , or a big part of us , use Gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like Iran , where dissidents use foreign services like Gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over SSL connections , so the local government can &apos;t Snoop on their discussions .
except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.
and issue rogue certificates .
and this is exactly what happened with the case of DigiNotar .
what about Arab Spring and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
well in Egypt , the rioters looted the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police in April 2011 , and when they were looting the building they found lots of papers .
among those papers , was this binder entitled &quot; FINFISHER . &quot;
and within that binder were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government .
the company headquarters are right here .
so Western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
for example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so @-@ called State Trojan was found , which was a Trojan used by German government officials to investigate their own citizens .
if you are a suspect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be tapped .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will tap your Internet connection .
they will even use tools like State Trojan to infect your computer with a Trojan , which enables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discussions , to collect your passwords .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citizen .
why should I worry ?
because I have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy is implied .
privacy is not up for discussion .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
it &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
this may sound strange , but I &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
the first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868 with a very simple idea : modules made of cement of a fixed measurement that fit together .
very quickly concrete blocks became the most @-@ used construction unit in the world .
they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time .
essentially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later in 1947 , LEGO came up with this .
it was called the Automatic Binding brick .
and in a few short years , LEGO bricks took place in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced -- or 75 bricks for every person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
Lego made it accessible .
Lego has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
meanwhile the exact same year , at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of static bricks piled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
but there &apos;s a main difference : the transistor was only for experts .
I personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so I decided to change that .
eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab , I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago I started developing littleBits .
let me show you how they work .
LittleBits are electronic modules with each one specific function .
they &apos;re pre @-@ engineered to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
the bricks are color @-@ coded .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
so all you need to do is snap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
you can put a knob in between and now you &apos;ve made a little dimmer .
switch out the knob for a pulse module , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blinker .
add this buzzer for some extra punch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
I &apos;m going to stop that .
so beyond simple play , littleBits are actually pretty powerful .
instead of having to program , to wire , to solder , littleBits allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
the idea behind littleBits is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to make every single interaction in the world into a ready @-@ to @-@ use brick .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors -- everything should be accessible .
we &apos;ve been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them .
and it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
for example , how a nightlight works , or why an elevator door stays open , or how an iPod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also been taking littleBits to design schools .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littleBits as a material .
here you see , with felt and paper water bottles , we have Geordie making ...
a few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering whatsoever -- just cardboard , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; Make something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a motion @-@ activated confetti canon ball .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
it &apos;s a lobster made of playdough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
to these non @-@ engineers , littleBits became another material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
so littleBits is open @-@ source .
you can go on the website , download all the design files , make them yourself .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so go ahead and start inventing .
thank you .
when I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
my father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
there was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
&quot; the Taliban are gone ! &quot; my father shouted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; you can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
a morning that I will never forget .
a real school .
you see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
so for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
it was the only way we both could be educated .
each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
the school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
we all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
from time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
we always wondered what they knew about us .
were we being followed ?
do they know where we live ?
we were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
a total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
there she is .
she retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
and my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
there was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
to him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
during Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
your money can be stolen . you can be forced to leave your home during a war .
but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
so do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
when I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
he not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
my family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
that &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
that &apos;s why I cofounded Sola , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
the exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
and I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
like Ahmed . that &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from Sola to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
as he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; kill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot;
what I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
it &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
in fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
but today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
but when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
to me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of Sola remind me of that .
like me , they are dreaming big .
thank you .
everything I do , and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa .
from 1971 to 1977 -- I look young , but I &apos;m not - -- I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for an Italian NGO , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
and I was distraught .
I thought , age 21 , that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa .
instead , everything we touched we killed .
our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; ripples from the Zambezi , &quot; was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food .
so we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ...
and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
and we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture .
but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot;
&quot; just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation . &quot;
and of course , everything in Africa grew beautifully .
we had these magnificent tomatoes . in Italy , a tomato would grow to this size . in Zambia , to this size .
and we could not believe , and we were telling the Zambians , &quot; Look how easy agriculture is . &quot;
when the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red , overnight , some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything .
and we said to the Zambians , &quot; My God , the hippos ! &quot;
and the Zambians said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot;
&quot; why didn &apos;t you tell us ? &quot; &quot; you never asked . &quot;
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Zambia .
because , you see , at least we fed the hippos .
you should see the rubbish - -- You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people .
you want to read the book , read &quot; Dead Aid , &quot; by Dambisa Moyo , Zambian woman economist .
the book was published in 2009 .
we Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
just go and read her book .
read it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
we Western people are imperialist , colonialist missionaries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : we either patronize them , or we are paternalistic .
the two words come from the Latin root &quot; pater , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
but they mean two different things .
paternalistic , I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . &quot; I love you so much . &quot;
patronizing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
that &apos;s why the white people in Africa are called &quot; bwana , &quot; boss .
I was given a slap in the face reading a book , &quot; Small is Beautiful , &quot; written by Schumacher , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
this should be the first principle of aid .
the first principle of aid is respect .
this morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial ? &quot;
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
so what you do -- you shut up .
you never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
we don &apos;t work from offices .
we meet at the cafe . we meet at the pub .
we have zero infrastructure .
and what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
the most important thing is passion .
you can give somebody an idea .
if that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
and then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
the person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
so years and years ago , I had this idea : why don &apos;t we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why don &apos;t , for once , listen to them ? but not in community meetings .
let me tell you a secret .
there is a problem with community meetings .
entrepreneurs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identified .
so planning has this blind spot .
the smartest people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .
what we do , we work one @-@ on @-@ one , and to work one @-@ on @-@ one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
you have to create a new profession .
the profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
I started this as a tryout in Esperance , in Western Australia .
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time , trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do .
and so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first client , and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a Maori guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; You the guy who helped Maori ? can you help us ? &quot;
and I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; Hey , you helped them . can you help us ? &quot;
in a year , I had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , &quot; How can you do that ?
how can you do - ? &quot; and I said , &quot; I do something very , very , very difficult .
I shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
so - - So the government says , &quot; Do it again . &quot;
we &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
we have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter Drucker says : &quot; planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy . &quot;
planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
so now you &apos;re rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
you have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
you have to offer them confidentiality , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in droves .
in a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
local , passionate people . that &apos;s who you have applauded .
so what I &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at .
we are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nonrenewable fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
the internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
what we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
government ? forget about it !
it will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
there &apos;s a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860 .
and in 1860 , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : the city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
they were already drowning in manure .
so 1860 , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York .
so what happens ? in 40 years &apos; time , in the year 1900 , in the United States of America , there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,001 .
the idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in backwaters .
Dearborn , Michigan . Henry Ford .
however , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
first , you have to offer them confidentiality .
otherwise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
the smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
guess what ?
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
it doesn &apos;t exist .
this person has never been born .
we &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
there &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : none were started by one person .
now we teach entrepreneurship to 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in Northumberland , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography , and the task of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds is to underline , in the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography how many times Richard uses the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
never the word &quot; I , &quot; and the word &quot; we &quot; 32 times .
he wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
so we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; What do you need ?
what can you do ? can you make it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you look after the money ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , no , I cannot do this . &quot; &quot; would you like me to find you somebody ? &quot;
we activate communities .
we have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
thank you .
five years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland .
Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
and I was scared .
really scared . scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
but as these conversations unfolded , I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
that &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amazed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well .
and I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non @-@ scientists to have these interactions .
but these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonderland .
so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
first question to answer for us : so what ?
tell us why your science is relevant to us .
don &apos;t just tell me that you study trabeculae , but tell me that you study trabeculae , which is the mesh @-@ like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating osteoporosis .
and when you &apos;re describing your science , beware of jargon .
jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
and making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down .
instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and excite us about your content .
and when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
what do bullets do ? bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
a slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
instead , this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective . it &apos;s showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower .
and the trick here is to use a single , readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
so I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering .
and because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , I want to summarize with an equation .
take your science , subtract your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
and so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me .
thank you .
one of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is &quot; snollygoster . &quot;
just because it sounds so good .
and what snollygoster means is &quot; a dishonest politician . &quot;
although there was a 19th @-@ century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said , &quot; A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party , platform or principle , and who , when he wins , gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy . &quot;
now I have no idea what &quot; talknophical &quot; is .
something to do with words , I assume .
but it &apos;s very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
it wasn &apos;t until , for example , 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber .
and this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of brass Crosby , who took on Parliament .
and he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned , but he was brave enough , he was brave enough to take them on , and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won .
and it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase &quot; as bold as brass . &quot;
most people think that &apos;s down to the metal .
it &apos;s not . it &apos;s down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press .
but to really show you how words and politics interact , I want to take you back to the United States of America , just after they &apos;d achieved independence .
and they had to face the question of what to call George Washington , their leader .
they didn &apos;t know .
what do you call the leader of a Republican country ?
and this was debated in Congress for ages and ages .
and there were all sorts of suggestions on the table , which might have made it .
I mean , some people wanted him to be called Chief magistrate Washington , and other people , His Highness George Washington , and other people , protector of the liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington .
not that catchy .
some people just wanted to call him King .
they thought it was tried and tested .
and they weren &apos;t even being monarchical there , they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term .
and , you know , it could have worked .
and everybody got insanely bored , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .
I read a diary of this poor senator , who just keeps coming back , &quot; Still on this subject . &quot;
and the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate .
the House of Representatives didn &apos;t want Washington to get drunk on power .
they didn &apos;t want to call him King in case that gave him ideas , or his successor ideas .
so they wanted to give him the humblest , meagerest , most pathetic title that they could think of .
and that title was &quot; President . &quot;
president . they didn &apos;t invent the title . I mean , it existed before , but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting .
it was like the foreman of the jury .
and it didn &apos;t have much more grandeur than the term &quot; foreman &quot; or &quot; overseer . &quot;
there were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government , but it was really a nothing title .
and that &apos;s why the Senate objected to it .
they said , that &apos;s ridiculous , you can &apos;t call him President .
this guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries .
and who &apos;s going to take him seriously if he &apos;s got a silly little title like President of the United States of America ?
and after three weeks of debate , in the end the Senate did not cave in .
instead , they agreed to use the title &quot; President &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations , whether under Republican or monarchical forms of government , whose custom it is to annex , through the office of the Chief magistrate , titles of respectability -- not bloody President -- and that in the intercourse with foreign nations , the majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity , i.e. , we don &apos;t want to look like bloody weirdos .
now you can learn three interesting things from this .
first of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President .
Barack Obama , President Obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the Senate to spring into action .
second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 223 years later .
but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the title , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff .
reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur .
and so the Senate won in the end .
they got their title of respectability .
and also , the Senate &apos;s other worry , the appearance of singularity -- well , it was a singularity back then .
but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
a hundred and forty @-@ seven .
all because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
and so , in the end , the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that humble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
and that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
thank you very much .
so I arrived by truck with about 50 rebels to the battle for Jalalabad as a 19 @-@ year @-@ old vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville , Florida .
I traded my converse black low @-@ tops for a pair of brown leather sandals and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn &apos;t even see .
and this was my first time in Afghanistan .
long before that I had grown up with the war , but alongside weekend sleepovers and Saturday soccer games and fistfights with racist children of the confederacy and religio @-@ nationalist demonstrations chanting , &quot; Down with communism and long live Afghanistan , &quot; and burning effigies of Brezhnev before I even knew what it meant .
but this is the geography of self .
and so I stand here today , Afghan by blood , redneck by the grace of God , an atheist and a radically politicized artist who &apos;s been living , working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan , but personally I don &apos;t want to paint rainbows ; I want to make art that disturbs identity and challenges authority and exposes hypocrisy and reinterprets reality and even uses kind of an imaginative ethnography to try and understand the world that we live in .
I want to spend a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like popstar bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich .
and where else can the jihadi gangster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan : &quot; vote for me ! I &apos;ve done jihad , and I &apos;m rich . &quot;
and try and use this campaign to expose these mafiosos who are masquerading as national heroes .
I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called &quot; payback &quot; and impersonate a police officer , set up a fake Checkpoint on the street of Kabul and stop cars , but instead of asking them for a bribe , offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they &apos;ll accept this 100 Afghanis on our behalf .
I want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict chic .
the war and the expatriate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fox fur and add it to a flack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable neo @-@ traditional vests .
and I &apos;d like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheelbarrow and putting it on the wall amidst Kipling &apos;s call of 1899 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday &apos;s colonial rhetoric about a &quot; white man &apos;s burden &quot; to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civilize him a bit .
but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , misinterpreted .
but I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mandates it .
that is my burden . what &apos;s yours ?
thank you .
Hi . my name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
actually , for 10 years .
and I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
so luckily I brought an outfit change .
this is the first outfit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
if some of the women were really horrified when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
not everybody gets to do that .
these heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
all right .
so why did I do that ?
that was awkward .
well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
image is powerful , but also image is superficial .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
and in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
and of course , barring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and immutable , has a huge impact on our lives .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
and I am on this stage because I am a model .
I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
and I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
and I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was scouted , &quot; but that means nothing .
the real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , slender figures , and femininity and white skin .
and this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cashing out on .
and I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashionistas who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Tyra . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen . &quot;
and first , I commend you on your model knowledge . very impressive .
but unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the 677 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non @-@ white .
the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
and the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
but the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
you know ? you can be anything .
you could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a ninja cardio @-@ thoracic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
if , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Meisel .
saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up .
it &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge , because unlike cardio @-@ thoracic surgeons , it can just be distilled right into -- right now .
so if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice HMI , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
it will look something like this .
hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
that was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a r√©sum√© and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your r√©sum√© reads , &quot; underwear Model : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look .
the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they retouch all the photos ? &quot;
and yeah , they pretty much retouch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
this picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bikini , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
this is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier .
here &apos;s me on the same day as this shoot .
my friend got to come with me .
here &apos;s me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue .
here &apos;s me on the soccer team and in V Magazine .
and here &apos;s me today .
and I hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
they are constructions , and they are constructions by a group of professionals , by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre @-@ production and post @-@ production , and they build this . that &apos;s not me .
okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
I do have too many 8 @-@ inch heels which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
when I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; Sorry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
and I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
I live in New York , and last year , of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked , 86 percent of them were black and Latino , and most of them were young men .
and there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? when will I get stopped ? &quot;
when I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
so the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;
and I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot;
and when we &apos;re backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
we say , &quot; It &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . &quot;
and those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , &quot; I am insecure . &quot;
and I &apos;m insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
and if you ever are wondering , &quot; If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair , will I be happier ? &quot;
you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes , and they &apos;re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet .
so when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , &quot; Look I &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
but I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
if there &apos;s a takeaway to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
thank you .
today I have just one request .
please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
now I &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .
Remi is 22 , tall and very handsome .
he &apos;s speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot .
Remi knows what love is .
he shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
he &apos;s not greedy . he doesn &apos;t see skin color .
he doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : he has never told a lie .
when he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
Samuel is 16 . he &apos;s tall . he &apos;s very handsome .
he has the most impeccable memory .
he has a selective one , though .
he doesn &apos;t remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod , conversations we had when he was four , weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies , and Lady Gaga &apos;s birthday .
don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
but most people don &apos;t agree .
and in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often bypassed and misunderstood .
but what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
it manifests in each individual differently , hence why Remi is so different from Sam .
and across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the fastest @-@ growing developmental disorders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
and I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism , but I cannot recall a day without it .
I was just three years old when my brother came along , and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life .
and after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
he screamed a lot .
he didn &apos;t want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me whatsoever .
Remi lived and reigned in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the smallest things , like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between .
and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never @-@ ending hyperactivity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
extraordinary .
now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
but I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individuality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with normality .
normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
it just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
and if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
thank you .
Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple , and exposure just a millionth of a second .
but now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
I present you a new type of photography , femto @-@ photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
and with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X @-@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second -- which is several femtoseconds -- I &apos;ll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that packet of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
now , if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons shatter into this bottle ?
how does light look in slow motion ?
now , the whole event
now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond - that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel - but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
but , Coca @-@ Cola did not sponsor this research .
now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
so , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside .
some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ripples of waves .
many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
as you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s bouncing around inside .
meanwhile , the ripples are traveling on the table , and because of the reflections at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the reflections are focused .
now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
it &apos;ll be a very boring movie - - of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
and what about some still @-@ life photography ?
you can watch the ripples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
it &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
I thought , this is how nature paints a photo , one femto frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
but if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light washes over the tomato , it continues to glow . it doesn &apos;t become dark .
why is that ? because the tomato is actually ripe , and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trillionths of a second .
so , in the future , when this femto @-@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it .
so how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
so , what we do is we send that bullet , those packet of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchronization , and from the gigabytes of data , we computationally weave together to create those femto @-@ videos I showed you .
and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
so , Superman can fly .
some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
it &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light .
and it &apos;s not science fiction . we have actually built it .
on the left , you see our femto @-@ camera .
there &apos;s a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
so after our paper was published in Nature Communications , it was highlighted by Nature.com , and they created this animation .
we &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the packet of the photons , they will scatter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin , which in turn will again scatter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot .
and because we have a camera that can run so fast , our femto @-@ camera , it has some unique abilities .
it has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
by shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
can we see it in full 3D ?
so this is our reconstruction .
now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders , and also for cardioscopes .
but of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto @-@ photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
now , like Doc Edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra @-@ fast photography , and I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time @-@ lapse and color @-@ coding , and we look at those ripples . remember , the time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second .
but there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
when you look at the ripples under the cap , the ripples are moving away from us .
the ripples should be moving towards us .
what &apos;s going on here ?
it turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time warp , we can correct for this distortion .
so whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visualizations , since our invention , we have open @-@ sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras - - and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
it &apos;s about time . thank you .
this is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
they kill our livestock .
this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
my community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
so I grew up hating lions so much .
the morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
so they kill the lions .
it &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
and I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
so I had to find a way of solving this problem .
and the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
but I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
so I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
and a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
but lions are very clever .
they will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
so he jumps in and kills the animals .
so one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
and I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
so I had an idea .
since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
so I got an old car battery , an indicator box . it &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . it blinks .
and I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
and that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
so I set up everything .
as you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
and the indicator box makes the lights flash .
as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
and that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
thanks .
so I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
so I put the lights . you can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
and my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
so one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
and here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
so my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Ash√™ ol√™n . it means in my language , thank you very much .
you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
so you got this scholarship . Yep .
you &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
what &apos;s the next one on your list ?
my next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
but I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
you already tried it once , right , and you -- I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock .
in the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
we &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
thank you so much . thank you .
I live in South Central .
this is South Central : liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
so the city planners , they get together and they figure they &apos;re going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else , so they change it to South Los Angeles , like this is going to fix what &apos;s really going wrong in the city .
this is South Los Angeles .
liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
just like 26.5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert , South Central Los Angeles , home of the drive @-@ thru and the drive @-@ by .
funny thing is , the drive @-@ thrus are killing more people than the drive @-@ bys .
people are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles .
for instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , Beverly Hills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
and I was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks .
and I figured , this has to stop .
so I figured that the problem is the solution .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn &apos;t impregnated with pesticides .
so what I did , I planted a food forest in front of my house .
it was on a strip of land that we call a parkway .
it &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
thing is , it &apos;s owned by the city .
but you have to maintain it .
so I &apos;m like , &quot; Cool . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and I gotta maintain it . &quot;
and this is how I decided to maintain it .
so me and my group , L.A. Green grounds , we got together and we started planting my food forest , fruit trees , you know , the whole nine , vegetables .
what we do , we &apos;re a pay @-@ it @-@ forward kind of group , where it &apos;s composed of gardeners from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it &apos;s completely volunteer , and everything we do is free .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
and then somebody complained .
the city came down on me , and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden , which this citation was turning into a warrant .
and I &apos;m like , &quot; Come on , really ?
a warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? &quot;
and I was like , &quot; Cool . bring it . &quot;
because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
so L.A. Times got ahold of it . Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman , and one of the Green grounds members , they put up a petition on Change.org , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .
we had a victory on our hands .
my councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we &apos;re doing .
I mean , come on , why wouldn &apos;t they ?
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
they own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
that &apos;s 20 Central Parks .
that &apos;s enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
why in the hell would they not okay this ?
growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
when one dollar &apos;s worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce .
it &apos;s my gospel , when I &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .
growing your own food is like printing your own money .
see , I have a legacy in South Central .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
and I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people , and I &apos;m manufacturing my own reality .
see , I &apos;m an artist .
gardening is my graffiti . I grow my art .
just like a graffiti artist , where they beautify walls , me , I beautiful lawns , parkways .
I use the garden , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my embellishment for that cloth .
you &apos;d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
you just couldn &apos;t imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
so what happened ?
I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
we are the soil .
you &apos;d be surprised how kids are affected by this .
gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
plus you get strawberries .
I remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my yard , and I came out and they looked so ashamed .
so I &apos;m like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and I told them , you know , you don &apos;t have to do this like this .
this is on the street for a reason .
it made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why I do this , and people asked me , &quot; Fin , aren &apos;t you afraid people are going to steal your food ? &quot;
and I &apos;m like , &quot; Hell no , I ain &apos;t afraid they &apos;re gonna steal it .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
that &apos;s the whole idea .
I want them to take it , but at the same time , I want them to take back their health . &quot;
there &apos;s another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles .
these are the guys , they helped me unload the truck .
it was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
so Green grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
we &apos;ve had , like , 50 people come to our dig @-@ ins and participate , and it &apos;s all volunteers .
if kids grow kale , kids eat kale .
if they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
but when none of this is presented to them , if they &apos;re not shown how food affects the mind and the body , they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
I see young people and they want to work , but they &apos;re in this thing where they &apos;re caught up -- I see kids of color and they &apos;re just on this track that &apos;s designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
so with gardening , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
and when we do this , who knows ?
we might produce the next George Washington Carver .
but if we don &apos;t change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
now this is one of my plans . this is what I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block .
I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
now don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
the funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
what I &apos;m talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pride and the honor in growing your own food , opening farmer &apos;s markets .
so what I want to do here , we gotta make this sexy .
so I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades , gangstas , gangsta gardeners .
we gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
if you ain &apos;t a gardener , you ain &apos;t gangsta .
get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
and let that be your weapon of choice .
so basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit .
if you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit .
peace . thank you .
thank you .
before March , 2011 , I was a photographic retoucher based in New York City .
we &apos;re pale , gray creatures .
we hide in dark , windowless rooms , and generally avoid sunlight .
we make skinny models skinnier , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get criticized in the press all the time , but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography .
on March 11 , 2011 , I watched from home , as the rest of the world did , as the tragic events unfolded in Japan .
soon after , an organization I volunteer with , All Hands Volunteers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
I , along with hundreds of other volunteers , knew we couldn &apos;t just sit at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
on May the 13th , I made my way to the town of ≈åfunato .
it &apos;s a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture , about 50,000 people , one of the first that was hit by the wave .
the waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height , and traveled over two miles inland .
as you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
we pulled debris from canals and ditches .
we cleaned schools . we de @-@ mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation .
we cleared tons and tons of stinking , rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant .
we got dirty , and we loved it .
for weeks , all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things .
they &apos;d been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards .
and everyone was doing the same .
they were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping .
now , it wasn &apos;t until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt .
as they had run from the wave , and for their lives , absolutely everything they had , everything had to be left behind .
at the end of my first week there , I found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town .
I was helping clean the onsen , the communal onsen , the huge giant bathtubs .
this happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos .
this is where people were handing them in , and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand @-@ cleaning them .
now , it was emotional and it was inspiring , and I &apos;ve always heard about thinking outside the box , but it wasn &apos;t until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened .
as I looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the processing lab , I couldn &apos;t help but think as a retoucher that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch , and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
so that evening , I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them , and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive , I knew we had to give it a go .
so we started retouching photos .
this was the very first .
not terribly damaged , but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl &apos;s face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy .
otherwise , that little girl isn &apos;t going to look like that little girl anymore , and surely that &apos;s as tragic as having the photo damaged .
over time , more photos came in , thankfully , and more retouchers were needed , and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn , and within five days , 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
within two weeks , I had 150 people wanting to join in .
within Japan , by July , we &apos;d branched out to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata , further north to a town called Yamada .
once a week , we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up , where people were reclaiming their photos .
the older ladies sometimes hadn &apos;t seen a scanner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scanned , uploaded to a cloud server , it would be downloaded by a gaijin , a stranger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it &apos;d start being fixed .
the time it took , however , to get it back is a completely different story , and it depended obviously on the damage involved .
it could take an hour . it could take weeks .
it could take months .
the kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand @-@ drawn , or pieced together , picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn &apos;t damaged .
it was very time @-@ consuming .
now , all these photos had been damaged by water , submerged in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so hand @-@ cleaning them was a huge part of the project .
we couldn &apos;t retouch the photo unless it was cleaned , dry and reclaimed .
now , we were lucky with our hand @-@ cleaning .
we had an amazing local woman who guided us .
it &apos;s very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos .
as my team leader Wynne once said , it &apos;s like doing a tattoo on someone .
you don &apos;t get a chance to mess it up .
the lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
she had started hand @-@ cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage .
she also had duplicates .
areas like her husband and her face , which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix , we could just put them together in one good photo , and remake the whole photo .
when she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
her photos were found by her husband &apos;s colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood , and they &apos;d recognized him .
the day of the tsunami , he &apos;d actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed .
he had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded .
her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
one of them got caught up in the water .
it took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived .
the day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son &apos;s 14th birthday .
for her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gift back to him , something he could look at again , something he remembered from before that wasn &apos;t still scarred from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed .
after six months in Japan , 1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands , hundreds of whom had helped us hand @-@ clean over 135,000 photographs , the large majority
a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back , fully restored and retouched .
during this time , we hadn &apos;t really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was printer inks .
we take photos constantly .
a photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
they &apos;re our memory @-@ keepers and our histories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you &apos;d go back to look for .
that &apos;s all this project was about , about restoring those little bits of humanity , giving someone that connection back .
when a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it .
the project &apos;s also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers .
for some of them , it &apos;s given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin .
I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them , Cindy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
&quot; as I worked , I couldn &apos;t help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images .
one in particular , a photo of women of all ages , from grandmother to little girl , gathered around a baby , struck a chord , because a similar photo from my family , my grandmother and mother , myself , and newborn daughter , hangs on our wall .
across the globe , throughout the ages , our basic needs are just the same , aren &apos;t they ? &quot;
thank you .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer .
my topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : why does she stay ?
why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just graduated from Harvard College .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine .
I had my first apartment , my first little green American Express card , and I had a very big secret .
my secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow @-@ point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate , many , many times .
the man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember .
I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
it may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College , an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; amp ; Johnson , Leo Burnett and The Washington Post .
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
my dog is a black lab , and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan .
so my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
it &apos;s everywhere .
and my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
not exactly .
over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long @-@ term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States .
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
I met Conor on a cold , rainy January night .
he sat next to me on the New York City subway , and he started chatting me up .
he told me two things .
one was that he , too , had just graduated from an Ivy League school , and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank .
but what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
he had these big cheeks , these big apple cheeks and this wheat @-@ blond hair , and he seemed so sweet .
one of the smartest things Conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship .
he did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me .
we started dating , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I &apos;d gone to Harvard , that I was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job .
he wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
Conor believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
and he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
if you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
now , Conor did not come home one day and announce , &quot; You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you &quot; - - &quot; so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot;
instead , Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me , because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side .
now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate , so I agreed , and I quit my job , and Conor and I left Manhattan together .
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love , that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical , financial and psychological trap .
the next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
and here &apos;s where those guns come in .
as soon as we moved to New England -- you know , that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns .
he kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
he kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
and he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
he needed them to feel protected .
but those guns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
it was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and I got frustrated , and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and I put on my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and I married him .
despite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much .
and he was very , very sorry .
he had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
it was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again .
it happened twice more on the honeymoon .
the first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver &apos;s side window .
and then a few days later , driving home from our honeymoon , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face .
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
one in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life , and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million .
so actually , I was in very good company .
back to my question : why did I stay ?
the answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons .
the other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I could have left any time .
to me , this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : it &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser .
because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the abuser has nothing left to lose .
other outcomes include long @-@ term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
and still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
I was able to leave , because of one final , sadistic beating that broke through my denial .
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
so I broke the silence .
I told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and I &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
we tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self @-@ destructive women , damaged goods .
the question , &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot;
is code for some people for , &quot; It &apos;s her fault for staying , &quot; as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us .
but since publishing &quot; Crazy Love , &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives -- joyous , happy lives -- as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
I remarried a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids .
I have that black lab , and I have that minivan .
what I will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me .
right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; Wow , how stupid was she , &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you .
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves .
abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
it &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you .
talk about what you heard here .
abuse thrives only in silence .
you have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
we victims need everyone .
we need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with full futures .
recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene , deescalate it , show victims a safe way out .
together we can make our beds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be .
thank you .
when I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called &quot; Nothing To envy . &quot;
and I was very proud .
in school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il @-@ Sung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
when I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution , but I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
my family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
but one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister .
it read , &quot; When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t eaten for the past two weeks .
we are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot;
I was so shocked .
this was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
soon after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can &apos;t erase from my memory .
a lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother &apos;s face .
but nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
a huge famine hit North Korea in the mid @-@ 1990s .
ultimately , more than a million North Koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
power outages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
this is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors .
this is the Amrok River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
as you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing North Koreans to secretly cross .
but many die .
sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down the river .
I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .
but I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
in China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants .
so I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .
one day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explode .
if anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
after they finished questioning me , one official said to another , &quot; This was a false report .
she &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies , but many can be caught by the Chinese police and repatriated .
these girls were so lucky .
even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
these North Koreans were not so lucky .
every year , countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
it &apos;s tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
that &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
we are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division .
I even went through an identity crisis .
am I South Korean or North Korean ?
where am I from ? who am I ?
suddenly , there was no country I could proudly call my own .
even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy , I made a plan .
I started studying for the university entrance exam .
just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .
the North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a punishment , my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside .
they had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them escape .
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
it &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , ironically , I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border .
since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia .
the journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
one time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer .
he took everyone &apos;s I.D. cards , and he started asking them questions .
since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
as the Chinese officer approached my family , I impulsively stood up , and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning .
he looked at me suspiciously , but luckily he believed me .
we made it all the way to the border of Laos , but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos .
but even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
after I paid the fine and bribe , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of Laos .
this was one of the lowest points in my life .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy .
I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to get my family out , but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore .
I lost all hope .
at that moment , I heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
in my broken English , and with a dictionary , I explained the situation , and without hesitating , the man went to the ATM and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail .
I thanked him with all my heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why are you helping me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Korean people . &quot;
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
the kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
eventually , after our long journey , my family and I were reunited in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
many North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
so we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more .
we can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support .
I &apos;m confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world , including the TED stage .
thank you .
you probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road .
it &apos;s made of asphalt , and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s raining a lot .
then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt .
and especially if you then ride with your bicycle , and pass these cars , then that &apos;s not very nice .
also , asphalt can create a lot of noise .
it &apos;s a noisy material , and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands , very close to cities , then we would like a silent road .
the solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt .
porous asphalt , a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands , it has pores and water can just rain through it , so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that &apos;s easy to drive on , so no splash water anymore .
also the noise will disappear in these pores .
because it &apos;s very hollow , all the noise will disappear , so it &apos;s a very silent road .
it also has disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur .
what is raveling ? you see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off .
first you get one stone , then several more , and more and more and more and more , and then they -- well , I will not do that .
but they can damage your windshield , so you &apos;re not happy with that .
and finally , this raveling can also lead to more and more damage .
sometimes you can create potholes with that .
ha . he &apos;s ready .
potholes , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
it &apos;s a porous asphalt , like I said , so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones .
due to weathering , due to U.V. light , due to oxidation , this binder , this bitumen , the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink , and if it shrinks , it gets micro @-@ cracks , and it delaminates from the aggregates .
then if you drive over the road , you take out the aggregates -- what we just saw here .
to solve this problem , we thought of self @-@ healing materials .
if we can make this material self @-@ healing , then probably we have a solution .
so what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans , and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces , and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen .
so then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it .
then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine .
induction can heat , especially steel ; it &apos;s very good at that .
then what you do is you heat up the steel , you melt the bitumen , and the bitumen will flow into these micro @-@ cracks , and the stones are again fixed to the surface .
today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here onstage .
so a microwave is a similar system .
so I put the specimen in , which I &apos;m now going to take out to see what happened .
so this is the specimen coming out now .
so I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .
we tested a lot of specimens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s very interesting . we have to try that . &quot;
so they donated to us a piece of highway , 400 meters of the A58 , where we had to make a test track to test this material .
so that &apos;s what we did here . you see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . that &apos;s what we know from practice .
so we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab .
so we did aging on the samples , did a lot of loading on it , healed them with our induction machine , and healed them and tested them again .
several times we can repeat that .
so actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .
well , to conclude , I can say that we made a material using steel fibers , the addition of steel fibers , using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks .
and now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .
so we still have the specimen here . it &apos;s quite warm .
actually , it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works .
but I will do a trial .
let &apos;s see . yeah , it worked .
thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
there are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds .
when you see a vulture like this , the first thing that comes to your mind is , these are disgusting , ugly , greedy creatures that are just after your flesh , associated with politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change those feelings you have for these birds , because they need our sympathy . they really do .
and I &apos;ll tell you why .
first of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
when Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832 on the Beagle , he saw the turkey vulture , and he said , &quot; These are disgusting birds with bald Scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity . &quot;
you could not get a worse insult , and that from Charles Darwin .
you know , he changed his mind when he came back , and I &apos;ll tell you why .
they &apos;ve also be associated with Disney - - personified as goofy , dumb , stupid characters .
more recently , if you &apos;ve been following the Kenyan press - - these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with . but I want to challenge that .
I want to challenge that . do you know why ?
because MPs do not keep the environment clean .
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
they are hardly monogamous .
they are far from being extinct .
and , my favorite is , vultures are better looking .
so there &apos;s two types of vultures in this planet .
there are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas , like the condors and the caracaras , and then the Old World vultures , where we have 16 species . from these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .
so why are vultures important ? first of all , they provide vital ecological services . they clean up .
they &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .
they clean up carcasses right to the bone .
they help to kill all the bacteria . they help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals .
recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures , carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose , and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases .
vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
they have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture .
Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood , and together with the cobra , symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt .
in Hindu mythology , Jatayu was the vulture god , and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the 10 @-@ headed Demon Ravana .
in Tibetan culture , they are performing very important sky burials . in places like Tibet , there are no places to bury the dead , or wood to cremate them , so these vultures provide a natural disposal system .
so what is the problem with vultures ?
we have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya , of which six are highly threatened with extinction .
the reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting poisoned is because there &apos;s human @-@ wildlife conflicts . the pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the vultures are falling victim to this .
in South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac .
this drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India , and they have taken a stand .
because there are no vultures , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have feral dogs , you have a huge time bomb of rabies . the number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa : 353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana .
I am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind turbines do this to birds . they slice them in half .
they are bird @-@ blending machines .
in West Africa , there &apos;s a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market .
so what &apos;s being done ? well , we &apos;re conducting research on these birds . we &apos;re putting transmitters on them .
we &apos;re trying to determine their basic ecology , and see where they go .
we can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it &apos;s not going to help you .
we need to work with governments in regional levels .
we &apos;re working with local communities .
we &apos;re talking to them about appreciating vultures , about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
how can you help ? you can become active , make noise . you can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures . volunteer your time to spread the word . spread the word .
when you walk out of this room , you will be informed about vultures , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighbors about vultures .
they are very graceful . Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies .
Kenya , this world , will be much poorer without these wonderful species .
thank you very much .
there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
we don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
so over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like stickers , stencils and chalk .
and these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
and how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
now , I live in New Orleans , and I am in love with New Orleans .
my soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees , shading lovers , drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years , and I trust a city that always makes way for music .
I feel like every time someone sneezes , New Orleans has a parade .
the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America .
I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
in 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .
her name was Joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
and I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
but I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day @-@ to @-@ day , and forget what really matters to you .
so with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill @-@ in @-@ the @-@ blank sentence : &quot; before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
and I &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
&quot; before I die , I want to be tried for piracy . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to straddle the International Date Line . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to sing for millions . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to plant a tree . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to live off the grid . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to hold her one more time . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to be someone &apos;s cavalry . &quot;
&quot; before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
so this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they consoled me during my own tough times .
it &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
it &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .
it &apos;s about making space for reflection and contemplation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
in our age of increasing distractions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
death is something that we &apos;re often discouraged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
thinking about death clarifies your life .
our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
thank you .
thank you .
I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
the air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three @-@ foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
when my hand slips , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
as I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
for the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
we started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
after we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
it started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the slaves and offer them my help .
thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
some I even considered like my second home .
but this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
a conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
that &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans @-@ Atlantic slave trade .
a hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
that equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
in India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kilns .
this strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante &apos;s Inferno .
enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
deadened by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
there were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
so pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . just don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
and he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
I &apos;d have to rely on Free the slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
as for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
in the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
the big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
it &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
how can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
they have nothing to compare it to .
when these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back @-@ breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
in Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
they ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
this wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
it was more like a restaurant .
cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
each cubicle is dark and dingy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and partitioned by plywood and a curtain .
the workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
standing in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
there were no back doors .
there were no windows large enough to climb through .
these people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic servitude , and the list can go on .
recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
it &apos;s all around us . we just don &apos;t see it .
the textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
this is a family portrait .
the dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
they mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
my interpreter told me their stories .
&quot; we have no freedom , &quot; they said .
&quot; we hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot;
it &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man @-@ made lake in the world .
when we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
wrong . they were all enslaved .
children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
this young child is eight years old .
he was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
he was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
the skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
many of them drown .
for as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
in the cold , windy night .
and it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
I met him at a shelter where Free the slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery .
here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
he told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
at the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; This is the path , this is the path . go . &quot;
as we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
after another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold , wading in water poisoned by mercury .
mercury is used in the extraction process .
these miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
when they came out of the shaft , they were soaking wet from their own sweat .
I remember looking into their tired , bloodshot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
the shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold .
at first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
all of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
in fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
this is Manuru . when his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
when his uncle died , Manuru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
when I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
on top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
I want to shine a light on slavery .
when I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
they knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
these images are not of issues . they are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
there is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistreated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
thank you very much .
so , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
no one knows what the hell we do .
so I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
we delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on .
now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it .
now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling , who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time .
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
however , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
we need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
but frustratingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biomarkers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20 @-@ minute neurologist test .
you have to go to the clinic to do it . it &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . it &apos;s never done .
but what if patients could do this test at home ?
now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
no expensive staff time required .
takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist &apos;s clinic to do it .
so what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling .
so here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FOXP2 , for example .
and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
from the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
so on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
we see all the same symptoms .
we see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
the speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
so these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
so these voice @-@ based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non @-@ invasive .
the neurologist &apos;s test is non @-@ invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
you don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
and they &apos;re both accurate . okay , but in addition , voice @-@ based tests are non @-@ expert .
that means they can be self @-@ administered .
they &apos;re high @-@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
they &apos;re ultra @-@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
when something becomes ultra @-@ low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
so here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
no need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup .
we can do high @-@ frequency monitoring to get objective data .
we can perform low @-@ cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make population @-@ scale screening feasible for the first time .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
so , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
with Aculab and PatientsLikeMe , we &apos;re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
we have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
thank you .
so Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
yeah . yeah . so what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . right .
you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
but we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
so you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
it &apos;s much better than that .
actually , my student Thanasis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
ninety @-@ nine . well , that &apos;s an improvement .
so what that means is that people will be able to - People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
absolutely .
thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .
thanks , Tom .
photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them .
there were no art directors , no stylists , no chance for reshoots , not even any regard for lighting .
in fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
my story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we &apos;re on the corner of 57th and 5th .
we happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
well you can see where this is going .
approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father @-@ daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;
this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
you know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger .
no one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
it &apos;s really become sacred to us .
this one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five @-@ year @-@ old could understand .
so these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
they &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new milestones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five @-@ year @-@ old standing in that exact spot .
she said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
and now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in New York .
and it hit me : one of the most important things we all make are memories .
so I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
so I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hesitate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
thank you .
