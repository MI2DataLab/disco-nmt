one day , the Los Angeles Times , Steve <unk> walked onto the streets of Los Angeles and heard a wonderful piece of music .
music was played by a man , an African @-@ American man who was a very glamorous man , and he was using only two strings .
now , I want to tell you about the story that many of you already know , because Steve &apos;s column turned out to be the basis of a book , and then Robert <unk> , who happened to be the founder of Nathaniel <unk> , who was a double <unk> on music training for his cause of schizophrenia .
Nathaniel was leaving at Juilliard , who had lost his completely 30 years after he had painted on the streets of Los Angeles .
I encourage you all to look at Steve books , or look at movies , not just to understand the beauty of these two men , but to see that music is the most useful tool for making this kind of ties .
I met Mr. <unk> in 2008 , a couple of years ago in Walt Disney Hall .
and he listened to Beethoven number one , and the fourth symphony came upon himself .
he talked a lot , a lot of <unk> , and he talked about the <unk> and Hillary Clinton couldn &apos;t get into the World Series , because of the <unk> of Beethoven &apos;s <unk> at the end of the month .
we talked a little bit about music . and a few days later , I got Steve letters to tell me that he was interested in playing with me .
what I should mention is that Nathaniel refused to treat because what he was given was an <unk> treatment , an <unk> and a scar that stayed in his life .
and as a result , his schizophrenia now became more direct , and the worst act of his encounter was that he would disappear from a couple of days on the street , on the side of the road , on the <unk> of the psyche .
Nathaniel was a state in which we started with the Disney Hall hall for the first grade in his eye , in a lost direction .
he mentioned the invisible devil and the smoke , and how someone could sleep at night without sleep .
I felt frightened of being less worried about my own security , but I was scared that I would lose him , and he would sink into one of his states , and I would destroy his relationship with the violin , and if I started talking about the scale and the other forms of music .
and so I started to do it .
and I played Beethoven &apos;s first feature .
when I was playing , I knew that there was something going on in the eyes of Nathaniel &apos;s eye .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s exposed to something that &apos;s invisible , it &apos;s like having a chemistry , and that &apos;s the catalyst for it .
he <unk> himself as a quiet curiosity , as well as elegance .
and the magic is he picks up his violin , and he starts playing with some of the pieces of the violin , and then he &apos;s going to do it again , and he &apos;s going to do it .
so we started talking about music : from Bach to Beethoven , to <unk> , all the names of the people that started with B.
and I realized that he wasn &apos;t just a piece of music , but he was able to connect the music with him .
he talked about the passion and the deep understanding of music as I was talking to colleagues in Los Angeles .
by playing music , talking about music , this man who was from a <unk> and a <unk> before the Los Angeles Street Journal turned into a fascinating , wonderful musician who had access to music .
music is medicine . music is transforming us .
music is helping him turn on the mind .
because music can help him turn his imagination into reality .
and that &apos;s what helped him out of his suffering .
and I know that &apos;s what art looks like .
and that &apos;s the reason why we create music , is that we use our own internal core of what we all have , our emotions , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , to shape our reality .
and this kind of expression of reality is bringing us to all of us , to inspire us .
and he took him back to a group of friends .
the power of the music is going to take him back to the home of the music community , where people understand his talents .
and I would always create music for him , whether it &apos;s on the streets of Walt Disney , or on the <unk> , because he would tell me why I was a musician .
thank you .
Bruno : thank you . thank you .
Robert Full .
Robert Full : now I &apos;m going to play you a piece of music that I &apos;ve been carrying around .
so please forgive me .
I &apos;ve been exposed to a lot of fish during my lifetime .
only two are my favorites .
the first one is passion .
it &apos;s a beautiful fish . it &apos;s delicious ; it &apos;s <unk> ; it &apos;s the most popular fish on the menu .
what a beautiful fish !
and even better yet , it &apos;s driven by the highest standard raise , which is sustainable .
and the people who sold him were pretty sick .
and I had this beautiful relationship , and it took me about a few months .
one day , the top telephone calls at the top of this company invited me to join an initiative and generate a sustainable development of fishing .
and I said , &quot; Well , you can do it . &quot;
this company is trying to solve a problem that we chef can &apos;t imagine : how do we stay on the menu ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing from all over the ocean like cut trees .
no , no , it &apos;s a disruptive .
ninety @-@ nine percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , they &apos;re extinct .
almost nothing left .
so , whether it &apos;s good or bad or evil , it &apos;s going to be part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of talk about this industry . most of them are about <unk> , and they &apos;re about very inefficient , like tuna .
the feed of the tuna is 15 to one .
what that means is , it &apos;s 15 pounds of meat per ton of wild fish .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
and it &apos;s not delicious .
and finally , this company wants to do something right .
and I wanted to support them .
the day before that event , I was exposed to the PR department for the company .
let &apos;s call him a foot bridge for four percent .
and I said , &quot; Don Burke , which I know is , you &apos;re famous in the fishing industry , and you don &apos;t get polluted . &quot;
and he said , &quot; You know what , we &apos;re doing a lot of work , and we &apos;re all naked , and we &apos;re releasing pollutants , and we &apos;re not going to stay anywhere . &quot;
and then he <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be on the top .
feed the feed ? two and a half .
the best of all @-@ time industries .
two and a half times better than one .
what &apos;s two and a half ? what are you feed ?
and he said , &quot; Well , sustainable protein . &quot;
I said , &quot; It &apos;s good . it &apos;s got a phone call . &quot;
and as a result , I was lying in my bed and I was thinking , what is the hell of a living protein ?
so the next day , before that incident , I phoned her foot .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t do you have any examples of sustainability ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask the people around .
and then I had a few phone calls from this company , but none of them gave me a clear answer , until finally , they &apos;re experts in biology .
let me tell you , I &apos;ll tell him that his Don &apos;t beat his feet up .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t do that , you know , do you want to do it all ? do you want to do it ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and he mentioned the following .
and I asked the question , what &apos;s the language ?
and he said , &quot; <unk> are feathers , <unk> , bones , waste , dry and then they dry their feed . &quot;
I said , what &apos;s the proportion of the chicken in the feed ?
think about it , you know , two percent .
and he said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent .
and I said , &quot; Well , don &apos;t you just cut your feet off , do you want to keep your feet warm ? &quot;
the phone &apos;s over there a long period of time , and he said to me , &quot; The world is so much chicken . &quot;
so I no longer love this fish .
no , not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous , self @-@ sufficiency .
I &apos;m the guy .
no , I no longer love this fish anymore , because I swear to God that after that dialogue , it was more like a chicken .
the second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love .
it &apos;s that romantic , the more you know your fish , the more you love it .
I first had this fish in a restaurant , in southern Spain .
a long time ago , a journalist told me that .
she could say it was a <unk> .
that fish lights up on the table with a <unk> , a white light .
chef cooked time .
it was like cooking twice .
but it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s delicious .
who can make it that way ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him <unk> . his name is <unk> .
but he didn &apos;t cook that fish . he wasn &apos;t a chef at least in the way you understand it .
he was a biologist in <unk> .
he &apos;s a <unk> in Spain .
he &apos;s on the front porch of the river &apos;s bank .
and it wasn &apos;t until the late 1980s , that was the <unk> of Argentina .
and they were there at the time , and this was basically wetlands .
they pull out the water .
and then they built a series of complex canals , and they put the water on the river .
but they didn &apos;t succeed , I mean economics .
and the conditions around the world had tremendous disasters .
almost 90 percent of all the birds around the world disappear , and in this area there are a lot of birds .
and then in 1982 , a Spanish company that had this picture taken from the country .
what did they do ?
they <unk> the flow .
they &apos;re basically <unk> .
instead of <unk> , they used the <unk> to bring water .
they fill it with the canals .
and then we built an <unk> @-@ acre <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- in this case , <unk> , <unk> , and this company , completely saved the pig .
and it was phenomenal .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
I looked at the horizon , which is so vast , and introduce you to the landscape is filled with the channel of water , and the wetlands of it .
not too long ago , I was there .
he &apos;s a remarkable man , and he &apos;s a Darwinian , a quarter of a crocodile .
we got into the wetlands , and I was <unk> , and I was <unk> , and I was told by the creatures that weren &apos;t there .
and here , he points to a very rare , very black shoulder <unk> .
this is , he mentioned the source of minerals .
and here , he saw a set of patterns that allow people to stick in Tanzania .
as a result , <unk> had spent a long time working in African National Park .
and I asked him how he became a fish expert .
he said , &quot; <unk> fish ? I don &apos;t know them . &quot;
I &apos;m just an expert on <unk> .
and then he started talking about rare birds and algae and different <unk> .
please don &apos;t get me wrong , and that conversation really is about the <unk> , about the kind of thing .
it was great , but I was in love .
there was always a <unk> in my mind that I would try to get over @-@ <unk> delicious fish .
so I quit him . I said , &quot; <unk> , what makes your fish sweet ? &quot;
he pointed to the algae .
and I knew that my brother , the algae , the plankton , the stuff , it was amazing .
but what does your fish eat ?
what &apos;s the feed of cattle ? what about the feed ?
and then he kept telling me that this is a very fertile system , and what these fish eat is that they eat in the wild .
plant biomass , plankton , plankton , plankton , species of fish .
it &apos;s a very healthy system . it &apos;s totally self @-@ update .
no feed .
have you ever heard about a farm for animals ?
later on that day , I was driving around with my wife , and I asked him , &quot; How do you measure this natural place , not like any other farm I &apos;ve ever seen , but how do you measure success ? &quot;
it was then , as if there was a film director that suddenly asked to change the scene .
we turn around and see the most beautiful picture , hundreds of thousands of pink <unk> , which is a pink carpet .
he said , &quot; That &apos;s success . &quot;
look at their belly , their pink .
they &apos;re currently enjoying their <unk> .
dinner ? I was completely confused .
I said , &quot; Look , <unk> , they &apos;re not your fish ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; He said .
<unk> birds eat 20 percent of our fish and fish .
and last year , this fishery had <unk> , over 250 different species .
today , this has become one of the largest and most important private birds in Europe .
I said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; so many birds don &apos;t want to be the most <unk> ? don &apos;t they want it ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
he said , &quot; Let &apos;s invest in general , not deliberate . &quot;
this is an ecology .
and then they eat shrimp .
shrimp farms .
so the more bright pink they have , the better the system is .
okay , so let &apos;s take a look at this . a farm doesn &apos;t feed its animal , and it &apos;s measuring its success based on its predators .
a camp , also a bird shelter .
and by the way , those <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t be there .
they breed in the city and outside 150 miles away , and the soil is much more potent .
every morning , they fly 150 miles to this fisheries .
and at night , they fly 150 miles home .
they did this because they could follow a white line on the freeway .
I &apos;m not kidding .
I &apos;ve been thinking about things like <unk> <unk> in my head , and I &apos;m looking at <unk> .
I said , Lewis <unk> , they fly 150 miles to fisheries , and they fly 150 miles at night ?
do they do it for their kids ?
and he looked at me as if I had just spoken out of the Whitney .
and he said , &quot; Well , they &apos;re not . they &apos;re doing it because it &apos;s better . &quot;
I haven &apos;t talked about my favorite <unk> of fish , which is delicious , and I normally don &apos;t like soup . I normally don &apos;t like soup .
it has <unk> , like tar @-@ like .
I never did it with the fish .
but when I was in the southern part of Spain , it didn &apos;t taste like <unk> .
it tasted <unk> and it was as if you had a taste of the nature of the ocean .
and I talked to him about my idea , and he was frowning .
he said , &quot; It &apos;s like a sponge . &quot;
it &apos;s the last line to prevent any substance to enter into the body .
and the effect of it is to absorb the <unk> .
and then he went on and said , &quot; But we don &apos;t have water . &quot;
okay . a <unk> does not feed its fish . a fishery measuring its success is due to natural predators .
and then I realized that when he said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; he said that , because water flowing through the fisheries chain comes from high seas water .
that river contains all of the stuff that &apos;s in the river right now , chemical pollutants , streaming down .
and when it gets to the system , it leaves the water , it gets cleaner .
it &apos;s a very hygiene . it can filter water here .
so , this fishery , not just to feed animals , not only to measure its success , but as a result of a <unk> , but as a <unk> , it &apos;s not just for the fish , but for you and me .
because water leaves here , it runs into the Atlantic .
I know it &apos;s a very small thing , but I &apos;m very concerned about it , and you should , because it &apos;s a love story , it &apos;s not just romantic , it &apos;s educational .
you might say it &apos;s the future food diet , whether we &apos;re talking about beef or beef .
what we need now is a new conception of agriculture , a real food .
but for a lot of people , it was extreme .
we were not a realist . we were love .
we love the market . we love small @-@ scale farms . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and then when you suggest that this food will guarantee the future of the future , and someone stands up somewhere and says , &quot; Man , I love the pink , but how do you make the world fill up ?
how do you feed the world ? &quot;
can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like your problem .
no , not just because we &apos;ve grown far more calories than we need in the world .
one billion people today are still in a state .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- is the root of the distribution , not the balance .
the real reason I don &apos;t like this is because he put up a food system , an logic that existed in the last 50 years .
bring grain to the soil , bring it to the plant , give it to the crop , give it to the soil , give it to the chicken , and agriculture can simply ask , what if we feed more people with cheaper ? what &apos;s wrong ?
that &apos;s an incentive . it has made sense . it &apos;s a business plan that belongs to American agriculture .
we should point out that its true identity , an ecological capital that was <unk> to make it possible .
that &apos;s not a business . it &apos;s not agriculture .
today , our food is under threat , not because of the supply of food , but because of the resources that are underway .
it wasn &apos;t invented by the latest <unk> technology and the tractor , but it was fertile soil , not by pump water , but by fresh water , not by <unk> , but by the forest , not by fishing and nets , but by the fish in the sea .
would you like to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking , how do we feed ourselves ?
or better yet , how do we create an environment where it can feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t expect the future sustainable agriculture model .
it &apos;s obsolete , and it &apos;s tired .
because it rely on excess capital , chemistry , machines and machines , and it doesn &apos;t really produce good food .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s been around for two billion years and a half billion years .
look at farmers like <unk> .
it &apos;s not just their own farm , it &apos;s self @-@ sufficiency , it &apos;s not about consumption , it &apos;s not about farms , it &apos;s not just about plants , it &apos;s not about intelligence , it &apos;s about intelligence .
because they &apos;re also experts in taste .
and if I want to be honest , they &apos;re better than I am .
you know , I completely agree that , because if the future good food is the way it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if I want to leave you with one idea today which is that all of the data that we consume are vastly greater than the sum of the parts , which is that all of the data that we consume , the amount of data that we consume , the volume of data that we &apos;re consuming to see instead of seeing it , instead of seeing it .
so what we see here is a typical death chart as age .
the tool I use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I can use filter for a special cause of death , like an accident .
immediately , I saw a different model .
and that &apos;s because , in the middle , people are here at the age of their most active age , and they &apos;re also the ones where they are .
we can reconstruct the data by dying , and we can see that recycling disease and cancer are the major conditions for death , but it &apos;s not true for everyone .
if we filter from the age of 40 , for example , we can see that there &apos;s a devastating accident that people need to be careful about .
and if you go further , it &apos;s particularly true for men .
well , you probably know that the tool is working in this way and look at information , and the data is very much like a living data image .
what if we could do this with the raw data ?
so we &apos;re showing here every single issue of history on this cover .
it &apos;s all over the Web .
you can go back to your room after I finished .
you can look at it in 10 years .
you can <unk> a year .
you can go directly into one issue .
for example , I saw this ; I saw ex @-@ <unk> athlete on this , sports .
I &apos;m a fan of Karen Armstrong , so I &apos;m clicking on it and showing me all of that .
now , if I just wanted to sample the peak of this data , I thought , okay , what about all the bike athletes ?
so I can take a step back and scale this up .
I saw Greg <unk> .
so you have to understand that when you look at information in this way , broad , backwards , backwards , you &apos;re not search , you &apos;re not browsing .
what you do is actually slightly different .
and in between , and we think this changes the way information is used .
so I came up with something a little bit crazy about this idea .
and what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve just plucked the Wikipedia page and then compress it to a little <unk> .
and the <unk> contain a profile that says that it comes from the field of expertise .
I &apos;m just showing you 500 of the most popular Wikipedia pages here .
but even in these limited browsing , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we know what the most popular thing in Wikipedia is .
I &apos;m going to continue and choose the government .
now , through chosen government , I can see that most of the times in Wikipedia is the year of Time magazine .
and that &apos;s important , because this is not a content of any <unk> website .
only if you step back and look at the big picture , you can see it .
look at one of these particular <unk> , and then I can dive into the magazine spending time .
so , if you look at these guys , I can see that most of them come from the government . some of them come from business . fewer them come from business .
and what &apos;s interesting is that the <unk> are also the great TED Prize .
so we can continue , and look at all the grand prize winners .
so you see , this is the first time we &apos;re running through the network as if it were a web , not just a page , but on a much higher level .
so I want to tell you another thing that might surprise you .
I &apos;m just showing you the New York Times website .
the <unk> , the app -- I don &apos;t want to call it the browser , but it &apos;s actually a browser , and you can browse the pages -- and we introduced it to every website like this , and we brought it back out and introduced it to every website like this .
so I can step back and get back to a specific place .
and the reason why this is important is because , in this way , I can see my entire history through the Web .
so I was able to dive into the specific events of the day .
here , actually , this is all I showed you .
I could sort of <unk> what I saw earlier today .
if I want to step back and look at everything , I can cut my history out , maybe my search history , and here I did some search @-@ and @-@ searching search , <unk> , which is where Microsoft has <unk> .
from this , I could go to the website and just ask them .
this is the same information , because the different goals are used multiple times , <unk> each time , making it more information than the sum of its parts . every time it <unk> , it keeps it more information than the sum of its parts .
now , in the world , we talk about data often about this curse .
we talked about the explosion of information .
we &apos;re talking about flooding in the ocean .
suppose we can turn this idea around and turn the web up and down , depending on each other &apos;s links , and let &apos;s start to look at the kinds of connections , the links , and see the patterns that we can &apos;t see , the hidden patterns , the hidden patterns that we can &apos;t see in this way ?
and if we can do that , instead of being stuck in the data , we can actually get access to information .
and not just processing information , we can tease out knowledge .
if we get knowledge , then we can even find intelligence .
thank you .
I grew up with science fiction .
when I was in high school , I went back to school every day .
in the long @-@ term drive , I &apos;ve been immersed in books , and these science science fiction brought my ideas into other worlds , and in narrative , I was very curious .
and besides that , I was also curious to see other things : whenever I didn &apos;t need to go to class , I would always go to trees , I &apos;d go to <unk> , <unk> , snakes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , everything in my home , everything underneath the microscope .
I was like a science <unk> .
but it &apos;s all about trying to understand the world , about the possibilities .
and I also responded to science fiction as well as the world around me , because at the end of the &apos; 60s , people started to dive into the deep sea .
Jacques <unk> , bringing his magic special visual effects into our lives , bringing them into the kinds of animals we could not imagine , the landscape , the landscape and a beautiful world .
all of this seems to resonate with science fiction .
at the same time , I was an artist .
I could paint .
and I also found that because there were no video games or special effects on video games , and there were mass <unk> in the media industry today , I had to create these images in my head .
and believe that when you &apos;re a kid , you know , when you &apos;re a student , you know , it &apos;s often played around in our brains .
and my response to that is to look at alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships and so on .
I was hiding in the back of the textbooks ; I was always covered in <unk> .
and as a result , I had to ask for my creativity to find other ways .
interestingly , Jacques <unk> &apos; film struck me as if there was a alien world on this planet .
I may not be able to actually drive into the alien world in my lifetime . it sounds too depressing .
but there &apos;s a world in which I can actually go to -- the incredible abundance , the incredible thing that comes from my books .
so in the year of my 15 year , I decided to become a divers .
but the only problem was , I was living in a small village in Canada , and the nearest sea was 600 miles away .
but I didn &apos;t do that .
and I repeated my father , until he found a dive in New York where I found a diving tree , and it was on the other side of the boundary .
and as a result , in a pool of water in a pool of water , I got my diving certificate .
but in the next two years , I watched the sea , and we moved to California .
over the next 40 years , I spent approximately 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours in the submersible .
and I found in the deep sea -- even the shallow water -- it &apos;s filled with amazing life , far beyond our imagination .
the imagination of our species compared to the imagination of nature .
and it wasn &apos;t until today that I saw everything that I &apos;d seen .
my love of the ocean has remained consistent .
but when I got bored , I picked up the movie .
and it seemed to me that this was the best way to combine my storytelling to create imagery .
as a child , I always paint cartoons .
and the movie made exactly the same way to combine the imagery and the story , and of course it will happen .
and of course , my story has been science fiction , The Terminator , &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; The <unk> , &quot; I combine my love of the deep sea and diving into film .
take two passions , combine them .
and there was another kind of improvement in this idea of making films better , creating liquid nitrogen from the video , and we started using computer animation .
the first <unk> of the computer were made , so it was born .
and while that movie happened , it happened to be back , and I saw this amazing scene -- the magic that all around the world were brought to .
that &apos;s what Arthur C. Clarke , whose technology and magic are unable to differentiate between .
and that &apos;s exactly what the audience saw .
that &apos;s what excites me .
and I was thinking , oh my God , this technology had to scale up in the art of the movie .
so in my next movie , &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; we pushed this technology to the new steps .
with collaboration with <unk> <unk> <unk> , film <unk> , we created the liquid metal guy in the film , and the success of the movie would depend whether this technology would work .
it worked . we made the magic again . we got the same feedback from the audience , but the movie department was a little bit better .
and together , we realized that this would be a new world for the artists to play with their imagination .
so I started a company with my friends , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> was the name of <unk> and <unk> .
and the idea that companies have is that they &apos;re going to go directly into digital manufacturing .
and in fact , we did . and that led us to a period of time .
but in the mid @-@ 1990s , we discovered that even though companies were designed to be in biology , in people &apos;s design , we had a problem .
so I created this work called &quot; The <unk> , &quot; which was designed to push the visual impact on the computer , using computer animation to create real human emotion , and mainly created by the computer .
but I touched the computer . the people in our company told me we couldn &apos;t do it at the time .
so I put this idea in there , and I moved to a film about the ocean floor .
I was talking to the movie company about this film , and it was going to be a beautiful , romantic film .
but my real motive was to go and visit the Titanic .
that &apos;s why I made that movie .
I mean , it was true . the movie company was unknown .
and I convinced them . I said , &quot; Look , we &apos;re going to dive into the field . &quot;
start with the film .
it was vital and theater .
so I convinced them to invest in an adventure .
sounds crazy . but ultimately , it &apos;s still about creating a reality if you use your imagination .
in fact , we did create a reality six months later -- I was underwater at 2.5 miles underwater in a Russian submersible , in a Russian submersible , looking at the Titanic .
it &apos;s not a movie . it &apos;s not a high @-@ definition .
and I was shocked by that experience .
and the early days of the session were really bright , and we needed to build cameras , lighting , etc .
but what was really striking to me was that these deep dives in the universe are like exploration .
both of them are high @-@ tech , and they both have to be widely deployed .
you walk into this dark , dark environment , and if you can &apos;t rely on your own power , you &apos;re not rescued by any rescue .
and I thought , &quot; Oh my God . I was like being in a science paper . &quot;
that &apos;s pretty cool .
and so the deep @-@ sea expedition became my new passion .
and of course , it comes down to the curious sense of wonder , of science . it &apos;s the creation of everything , the unknown , the curiosity @-@ based , the imagination .
Hollywood couldn &apos;t give my experience .
I could imagine a living organism , and I could use it to create it out of a computer special special effect , but I couldn &apos;t imagine what I saw that day .
and in the course of our expedition , I looked to see creatures living in the hydrothermal vents , and sometimes I &apos;d never seen anything I &apos;d seen before , and sometimes I &apos;d seen anything that no one had ever looked at before , even something we had identified before .
and as a result , I was full of <unk> and had to go on .
so I made this amazing decision .
and after the &quot; Titanic &quot; became successful , I decided , &quot; All right , I &apos;ve done a film in Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to be a explorers in the next few days .
so we started to plan these expeditions .
we went to the <unk> , and we used robotic devices to detect the pieces of it .
we then went back to the Titanic .
and there &apos;s a bunch of robots that can contain optical fibers .
the goal is to dive into the wreckage and to explore the inside of it -- an unprecedented act .
and before that , no one had ever looked at the wreckage . they didn &apos;t have the technology needed , so we created that technique .
you know , I was on the deck of the Titanic , sitting in a submersible , looking like the deck of the Titanic , thinking of the band from here .
I was controlling a small robot to fly through the corridors .
even though I &apos;m manipulating it , my mind is in this field of discovery .
I felt that I was really on the wreckage of the Titanic .
and that was the most incredible experience that I had ever met with , because before the robot was lighting up the lights , I already knew what was hidden in the corner of every corner , and the reason was because of the movie , I spent a lot of months doing this scene .
and the actual model that came out of the studio is a real model made from this ship .
so the experience was extraordinary .
it allowed me to experience a distance @-@ controlled experience -- and we even had the physical form of these robots , and we inject them into something else .
and that &apos;s a profound feeling .
maybe it &apos;s going to make us think about what the world will look like in the next few decades , as a science community , and I can imagine the future of human society , using half @-@ trillion machines to explore and other activities .
so through these expeditions , I began to really appreciate the beauty of the sea floor , these amazing creatures that live in deep @-@ sea creatures .
they live in a chemical factory .
it doesn &apos;t really require light from the sun that we live in .
so when you see the animals living at 500 degrees below the sea floor .
you think they &apos;re not going to survive .
and at the same time , I became interested in the science of space technology , and it was also affecting science fiction .
and as a result , I had a very tight connection with the space community , working with the United States , and became one of the members of their <unk> , the actual space mission , to go to Russia , to see a series of things , before we took our 3D space .
this experience is pretty impressive .
but what I ended up doing was trying to convince the space scientists to go underneath the ocean .
let them experience it . space biologists , <unk> , etc . , people who are interested in the extreme environments that take us to the deep sea floor , where they can see , take samples , take <unk> , etc .
so what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re working on a research project called <unk> .
I &apos;ve connected it as a child &apos;s experience of science as a child .
I also learned a lot about this journey .
I learned a lot about science , but I also learned a lot about leadership .
you felt that the director had to be a leader , a leadership , a <unk> .
but before these expeditions , I knew nothing about leaders .
because I had to ask myself , what was I doing ?
why do I do this ? what do I do ?
these damn documentaries don &apos;t make money .
we want to see it all easy . it &apos;s not easy .
a lot of people think that I &apos;m between the Titanic and the two films of &quot; Avatar , &quot; and sitting on the beach as well .
but actually I made these films , and there were only a few of them .
there &apos;s no money , no money . what are you doing ?
and what I do is I do this for the value of this experience of the value of this experience -- the world &apos;s most challenging environment , and I do all of this as a surprise of discovery , for the kind of small group of people that hit a team .
because every time we &apos;ve been working with 10 to 12 people for a couple of years , sometimes two to three months at sea .
and the most important thing you realize in that kind of <unk> is that you live with them , you live in a task that cannot explain to other people .
and when you go back to the coast , you say , &quot; Well , we need to do this , this optical fibers , this <unk> , this <unk> , this <unk> , the <unk> , the hard work -- these are the kinds of things you can &apos;t explain to other people , like the police , the police , the soldiers who have seen them .
create a cohesion , creating a cohesive heritage .
so when I came back to make my next film &quot; Avatar , &quot; and I tried to apply the same principles of leadership -- respect your team , and they <unk> you .
and it really changed the dynamic of the team .
I went back to work with a small team to create new technologies that didn &apos;t exist .
exciting .
it &apos;s full of challenges .
in four and a half years , we become a family .
it completely changed the way I made films .
people review this : you take the sea @-@ bottom organisms and bring them back to the field and put them on the planet .
for me , it &apos;s more about the laws and the processes that make things happen .
so what did we get from all of this ?
what have we learned ?
the first thing I thought was curiosity .
this is the most powerful thing you have .
imagination is a force that reflects the power of reality .
and your team is more important to your respect than all the rest of the world .
and sometimes a young filmmaker asked me , &quot; Don &apos;t give me advice for a few movies . &quot;
and my answer was , don &apos;t stay with you .
other people are going to be limiting you , but you don &apos;t control your own borders , but you don &apos;t take your own weight . don &apos;t take risks . go ahead .
there &apos;s a quote from the United States that they love : it &apos;s not an option . it &apos;s not an option .
but in art and exploration , failure must be an option , because it requires a challenge .
none of the major endeavors for innovation are done without risk .
you have to take those risks .
and that &apos;s what I want to leave you with : whenever you do anything , failure is one of them , but fear is not . thank you .
what I &apos;d like to talk about today is energy and climate , which may seem surprising .
what I want to talk to you about today is energy and climate , and it may be surprising that my full @-@ time job at the foundation of the Foundation is really about disease and agriculture , and that &apos;s really what we need to invent , to improve the lives of the poorest two billion in the world .
but in fact , energy and climate are particularly important to these people , in fact , more important than the rest of the world , but in fact , energy and climate are particularly important to those people , in fact , than other people on the planet .
climate degradation means that their crops will survive for years and years will not grow , meaning drought or drought , meaning that their crops will not grow for many years , that means they will not grow , that will survive , that they will not survive .
that would cause famine , and it would cause collapse .
so , climate change will bring them back to life , and also , it will be critical for them .
so , climate change will bring them back to life , and also , it will be critical for them .
in fact , if you just reduce the price of something by reducing poverty , you have to conclude that , in fact , if you only reduce the price of something that reduces poverty , you have to conclude by doing it .
and as the human race has come down , modern civilization is based on advanced energy .
and as the human race has come down , modern civilization is based on advanced energy .
the coal revolution that began to advance the industrial revolution earlier in the beginning of the 20th century , and we had a rapid rise of air conditioning , and that &apos;s why we could enjoy the outdoor air conditioning of the century , and in the beginning of the 20th century , we would fall as fast as we could enjoy the outdoor air .
and with electricity , we can live in a rich world .
but when we got further and further down , for example , we got a new limit that was about twice as cheap as we could , and we had a new limitation about CO2 , and we had a new limit about CO2 .
carbon dioxide is causing global warming , and the formula for carbon dioxide emissions is actually very simple , and carbon dioxide is warming , and the formula for CO2 emissions is very simple .
the CO2 emissions today are going to cause the temperature to go up , and the great CO2 emissions are going to cause the temperature rise to the temperature , and the consequences of a very harsh effect , such as the effects of the weather , or the effects of the ecosystem , or the effects of the collapse of the ecosystem .
what &apos;s the effect of the carbon dioxide emissions , the temperature rises , the difference between the two ? why is the CO2 increases , the temperature rises and the temperature rises , the drain -- what &apos;s the effect of CO2 increases , what &apos;s the temperature rises up to the temperature ? why is the middle ?
there &apos;s a lot of downsides to global warming , and it can &apos;t be quite sure , but certainly it &apos;s extremely harsh that the negative effects of global warming are enormous .
so many times I &apos;ve asked the best scientists : do we really have to cut carbon dioxide down to zero ? I &apos;ve been asked to ask all the best scientists : do we really have to get it to zero ?
reduced to half or less ?
and the answer is , unless we get to zero , the temperature goes up , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge , and the answer is , unless we get to zero , the temperature goes up , that &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
and the answer is , unless we get to zero , the temperature goes up , that &apos;s a huge challenge .
this is different from having a 12 @-@ foot truck that <unk> 10 @-@ foot bridge over 10 feet , so that you can get a truck that &apos;s different than a 12 @-@ foot truck , through 10 feet of a bridge , if you can figure it out .
carbon dioxide emissions are completely reduced to zero .
now we &apos;re going to get a lot of CO2 per year , more than four billion tons per year , and we &apos;re going to get a lot more CO2 per year .
about 20 tons per person in the United States , less than a ton of poverty , roughly a ton per capita , around five tons per capita -- about 20 tons per person , about less than a ton per capita -- about five tons .
the United States has about 20 tons , and less than a ton of poverty , about five tons per capita .
in any case , we all have to make a difference , until we lower that number down to zero , and we all have to make a difference , until we lower that number down to zero .
and the numbers are still going up , and there are just a few points that suppress the momentum .
and the numbers are still going up , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit slower , and we have to bend it down , and we &apos;re going to go down to zero , and we &apos;re going to stop it fast , and we &apos;re going to keep it going up , and we &apos;re going to go down to zero .
this is a formula for producing four factors , three times more carbon dioxide , one on the left @-@ hand side , and the goal here is to take it down to zero carbon dioxide per capita , per capita income , per capita , per square @-@ unit of consumption , and look at the amount of CO2 per kilowatt @-@ hour , per @-@ hour of CO2 per capita , the amount of CO2 per @-@ capita , and so we use .
obviously , we need at least one factor , which is very high school algebra .
so obviously , we need at least one of these factors , and this is a simple high school algebra , and let &apos;s see , first of all , population counts .
let &apos;s see , first of all , population .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and that will continue to grow to about nine billion people .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and that will continue to grow to about nine billion people .
if we do this in a new vaccine , health care , reproductive health , and if we do it effectively , if we do it in a new vaccine , for services , for reproductive health , this number probably costs about 10 to 15 percent less than 10 to 15 percent .
the second element is the service we use .
this includes everything : the food we eat , the clothes , the clothes , the heat , the heat , the heat , the very beautiful things , everything that we eat : our food , our clothing , our clothes , our heat , our heat , the things that are wonderful .
and that includes everything : the food we eat , the clothes , the clothes , the heat , the heat , the heat , the things that come out of poverty , and that means giving them to everyone on the planet , and that &apos;s a good thing to get out of poverty , and that &apos;s a good thing to get rid of it .
getting out of poverty means providing it to everyone on the planet , and that &apos;s a good thing .
in the developed world , the richest one in the world , may be able to control consumption , reduce services , enjoy services in the developed world , save one billion people , maybe not just control , but in general , the numbers are going to be growing up , not only doubling every year , but they &apos;re going to add up to every year .
in this area , we have services that are very base : have you ever written lighting in your house ? in this area , we have services that are very basic : do you have any homework lighting at home ?
the kids don &apos;t do it , so they go out and sit underneath the desk under the street , and the kids don &apos;t do it , so they go out and sit underneath the desk under the street lamp .
the next element is efficiency , the energy consumption of every service , and we have some good news : that &apos;s not going to go up .
so here we have some good news . this is not going to go up .
with all sorts of innovations and new lighting , we can reduce the amount of energy from our new technologies , new ways of making and new lighting , through all sorts of new technologies , new ways of buildings , and we can reduce the amount of services that we use to consume , maybe 90 percent , maybe even less energy .
we can reduce the amount of energy consumed by many services , individual services , even 90 percent .
but other services , things like fertilizer , <unk> , you can get a lot of space , but other services , things like fertilizer , <unk> , things like fertilizer , you can get a lot better space , but other services , like fertilizer , fertilizer , you can get a lot better .
so , combined , the positive estimate of this is this : we may be able to achieve three to five times fewer , so we can combine that with a combination of optimism that we might be able to achieve by three to five times fewer .
we &apos;ve talked about three factors , and we &apos;ve dropped emissions from <unk> tons to 130 million tons , and that &apos;s not enough to talk about three factors , and we &apos;ve dropped emissions from <unk> tons to 130 tons , and that &apos;s enough to talk about three things , and we &apos;re going to cut it from 130 tons , which is not enough .
and finally , we look at the fourth factor , the fourth factor , the fourth factor , the fourth factor , the most critical thing , is the CO2 emissions per unit .
and the question is , can this really go down to zero ?
I couldn &apos;t help . I couldn &apos;t do it .
I couldn &apos;t help . I couldn &apos;t do it .
all of the electricity we have today generates carbon dioxide , except for developing renewable energy and nuclear energy , all of the electricity we have today generates CO2 , except for renewable energy .
so we need to create a new system around the world , and we need energy miracles , so we need to build a new system around the world , and we need energy miracle .
so we need to create a new system around the world , and we need energy miracles .
I used a miracle <unk> , but it &apos;s not a word that &apos;s impossible .
it &apos;s a miracle . the PC is a miracle . it &apos;s a miracle .
it &apos;s a miracle . the PC is a miracle . it &apos;s a miracle .
in other words , you &apos;ve seen it even in a lot of wonder .
generally , we don &apos;t have a final deadline for wonder , we don &apos;t have a final deadline for wonder .
normally , you just act out of denial , and some magic happens , and some of them don &apos;t .
but in the low carbon emissions , we have to go all the way , and we do it all the way , and we have to do it all the way , and we have to do it all the way , and we have to do it in the end .
and I thought , &quot; How can I get better at this ? &quot;
and I thought , how can I get better at this ? is there a sense of nature that can inspire people &apos;s imaginations ?
and I came back about a year ago , and I brought some of these mosquitos here , and it was kind of nice to me to think about a year ago , and I brought some mosquito here , and it seemed like a pretty good idea .
the mosquito had really realized that some people in the world live with mosquitos , and they realized that there were some people in the world who lived with them .
so today , since I &apos;m talking about energy , I think of this : fireflies .
and I decided that I would send fireflies to my environmental contribution this year , and I decided that fireflies would be my contribution to the environment this year .
there &apos;s a few natural fireflies who say they don &apos;t bite , and they probably won &apos;t .
there &apos;s a few natural fireflies who say they don &apos;t bite , and they probably won &apos;t .
there &apos;s a few natural fireflies who say that they don &apos;t bite each other , and maybe they &apos;ve got a lot of thinking about energy like fireflies , but they &apos;re actually quite limited in terms of energy like fireflies , but they &apos;re actually quite limited .
what we need is a solution , a solution , a lot of things , a lot of <unk> and reliability solutions that we need to be solution , a solution , a lot of things , a very high @-@ resolution solutions that we need , a lot of things , a lot of <unk> and reliability , even though people are only exploring in the right direction .
I didn &apos;t include the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> , which contributed to it .
I didn &apos;t include the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the fuel , the things that would make a difference if their performance was more than I thought they were , but the key was , of course , that we had to put a lot of money in the water supply , but the key thing was that we had to do it in a huge way that they didn &apos;t seem to challenge .
let &apos;s take a look at fossil fuels , fossil fuels , first of all , and look at fossil fuels .
and what we need to do , in short , is not that we need to take all the burning of carbon dioxide , we &apos;re collecting chimneys , we need pressure , we &apos;re going to need to take all the CO2 , we &apos;re burning it , we &apos;re releasing it , we &apos;re not sure that we &apos;re burning it , we &apos;re burning it .
the current trials have been done at 60 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult thing to do , and it &apos;s going to be a 50 to 80 percent present , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to do it , and it &apos;s going to store a lot of CO2 , and it &apos;s a long @-@ term problem .
who would ensure it ?
one billion times more waste than any other waste , who can guarantee long @-@ term safety ? one billion times more waste than any other waste , who can ensure long @-@ term security ?
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 .
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 .
next , nuclear , again , three big questions .
next , nuclear energy , again , three big problems , and it costs a lot of money , especially in highly controlled states , very safe issues , to make sure that everything is safe , even if it &apos;s artificial .
what about nuclear waste ?
there &apos;s a lot of worry about it .
the good solution has to make people feel secure .
it &apos;s three challenges , but it &apos;s possible to solve them , so it &apos;s going to work .
the last three of the five energy sources , I &apos;ll put them together .
these are three things that people normally call renewable energy .
in fact , they don &apos;t need fuel , but they don &apos;t do it .
the first is that the density of energy that these technologies collected , the density of energy density , the bigger than the plant , the first thing is the density of the energy that these technologies have collected , is much lower than the plant .
this is energy agriculture , and it &apos;s scale @-@ up , larger than conventional power plants .
also , the energy is <unk> .
the sun didn &apos;t come all day , and it wasn &apos;t always the same , the wind and the wind .
if you &apos;re dependent on this source , you have other channels of energy , you have to have other channels for energy , you have to have other channels for energy .
so , we face huge amounts of cost problems , and we have the challenge of transmission , for example , some energy source coming from abroad , where you don &apos;t just need energy , but you need energy .
and finally , the issue of storage .
in order to make this happen , I looked at all of the current battery , and I looked at the question , and I looked at all the current battery , the computers , the <unk> , the <unk> , the battery on all the stuff , and the battery consumption of the energy consumed in the world in 10 minutes , and I found that we don &apos;t have any energy .
so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough to take a 100 times better solution than the present technology , a 100 times better solution than today .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
in this way , we can use <unk> energy to provide 20 to 30 percent of the energy needed .
but if you want 100 percent to rely on it , you need a very efficient magic battery .
so what do we do ? where do we go ?
is this a Manhattan Project ? how can we get there ?
we need a lot of companies working together , working together , working together .
every one of these five approaches , we all need at least 100 people .
a lot of people , you think they &apos;re crazy , and that &apos;s right .
I think there &apos;s been a lot of people in the TED community who are starting to work on this .
Bill <unk> has <unk> , and one of them is called <unk> , and it &apos;s a very nice , solar @-@ hot source technology , Bill <unk> , and one of them is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> investing in <unk> , their job is really great , and it &apos;s a fascinating possibility , and I plan to support their projects .
in fact , <unk> and I have been supportive of a company , which may be surprising , but this company is nuclear energy .
in nuclear energy , there &apos;s a little bit of innovation , like the mold , the liquid , the liquid , etc .
but actually innovation has stopped for a while in the industry , so there &apos;s a few good ideas out there right now that are not weird .
and the idea was that , instead of burning uranium , you can &apos;t burn normally , you can &apos;t burn it , you can &apos;t burn it , you can &apos;t burn it .
it &apos;s a bit of a crazy idea , but actually , people have talked about it for a long time .
it &apos;s a little bit of a crazy idea , but actually , people have talked a lot about a long time , but there &apos;s not a good idea about whether or not this can happen , but we can do it now , and it &apos;s predictable , and it &apos;s useful .
and because we &apos;re burning , 99 percent of the waste that used to be thrown away is enormous .
you actually take waste and you don &apos;t have to worry about how to handle all the waste from existing reactors , which is a good news .
we don &apos;t have to worry about the waste from all the nuclear reactors , which is a pretty good news .
it &apos;s like a candle , and it &apos;s going to uranium .
and the process is like this column , which is normally called a <unk> reactor .
the problem with fuel is solved .
this is a waste field in Kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , and that &apos;s 99 percent of the fuel that &apos;s already run out of gas , is known as <unk> .
it could be for hundreds of years .
on the other hand , just through a low @-@ cost filter process , you get enough gas to get off the Earth .
you see , there &apos;s a lot of challenges in the front , but this is just one example of one of the ways in which we can continue .
think about how we measure our achievement .
how much should we do ?
let &apos;s take a look at what we &apos;re going to do , and look at what we &apos;re going to do , and look at what we &apos;re going to do .
there &apos;s been a lot of people talking about 80 percent of what we &apos;ve been talking about by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we have to do it .
and the 20 percent of the country &apos;s population , like some agricultural countries , hopefully we &apos;ve cleaned up the <unk> and the concrete industry .
so , to get to 80 percent of the developed world , and the country needs to change their electricity .
and the other step is , do we deploy the technologies that we &apos;ve deployed in all of the developed countries , and we &apos;ve implemented it in other parts of the world ?
that &apos;s important .
this is the key ingredient to hand .
what should we do in 2020 ?
well , there are two of them .
and we should look at the metrics in how much less efficient we can start to reduce the amount of CO2 , the lower temperature of CO2 .
but in a way , one of the things that we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve done some work in the year 2020 , but not just massive amounts of cutting emissions , but one of the things that &apos;s important is to take a leap of innovation .
we need to be able to do it all the time , so we can take the number of companies , the number of trials , the number of programs , or the <unk> of policy changes .
there &apos;s a lot of great books about this topic .
for example , Al &apos;s &quot; our choice , &quot; David <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> energy . &quot;
they were looking at it , and they built a framework that was easy to talk about , because we had to deal with the problem .
it takes a lot of collaboration .
that &apos;s a wish .
we developed this technology as a very specific wish .
if I could give you a wish for the next 50 , I could choose who was going to be in charge of a president or a vaccine , which was my passion , or my energy choice , to cut in half , and I would certainly choose energy .
that would be the biggest impact .
if we can &apos;t fulfill this wish of a short @-@ term goal and a long @-@ term goal , there &apos;s a huge divergence between Americans and China , with the rich countries , with the rich countries , and the poorest two billion , most of which are worse .
so what do we have to do ?
what do I ask you to engage in ?
we should add research to aid .
in a conference like Copenhagen , where countries should not talk about cutting carbon emissions .
and I should talk about innovation and tell you about the dedication of these innovative approaches .
we really need market incentives , carbon dioxide , <unk> and trading , for these things .
we need to get information out .
we should make it more conceptual , more easy to understand , including the government .
it &apos;s an important wish , and I think it &apos;s a wish for it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you , and I knew the first thing about this investment industry , and you could say , how big is it ?
Bill Gates : if it &apos;s just buying supercomputers and making software to hire good scientists , we &apos;ve done it probably only for about <unk> -- we even went to a Russian reactor test our material to see if it would work , but it would cost a few billion dollars .
and the hard part is to build these reactors , like billions of dollars , go to the manager , find the place where they want to be .
and when you built the first thing , if it did , it was as easy as it were , because its economy , its energy density , its density , is completely different than the nuclear energy we know .
so , does this need to be built in the ground , build a vertical @-@ takeoff column made from this sort of abandoned <unk> site , a <unk> site made out of <unk> , made out of <unk> ?
J Yep . now nuclear reactors , you &apos;ve got to add @-@ on fuel all the time , so there &apos;s a lot of <unk> and control going wrong , and you &apos;ve got to get rid of it , and it &apos;s going to go wrong , and you &apos;ve got to get rid of the reactor , and you &apos;ve got to get rid of it , and it &apos;s going to get insurance .
so if there &apos;s a very cheap fuel , it &apos;s a six @-@ size fuel , it &apos;s a six @-@ year @-@ old enough fuel , so if it &apos;s a very cheap fuel , it &apos;s about the size of 60 years , and it has no complexity .
put them there for 60 years , and then it went away .
that &apos;s where the nuclear power plant itself is treated by its own waste .
J Yep . this process came out , and you could just put it there , and you could just use it to generate very little waste , and you could put it in another nuclear power plant , and you could burn it in a different nuclear power plant .
we can start to process the waste from existing nuclear plants that we have today , the waste that &apos;s cooled the <unk> or the reactor , and this is where we started .
so the current reactor , the problem of the reactor , is to become our ingredients , and it &apos;s reducing our waste so that the current waste is in trouble , the waste is our material , and it &apos;s reducing our waste so that we &apos;re in trouble , that we &apos;re in trouble , that we &apos;re at the same time that our current waste is degraded .
Moderator : when you talk to someone else in the other part of the story of the possibility .
who was interested in doing this ?
J We haven &apos;t chosen a specific place , because there &apos;s a legal issue around the world , a lot of people are interested in Russia , India , China , companies in China , and I &apos;ve been very interested in how I &apos;ve been talking about energy , how I &apos;ve been talking about how to bring this into energy agenda .
I was very optimistic , and also French and Japan have done some work .
this is a variant of what has been done .
it &apos;s an important improvement , but it &apos;s like a very fast reactor that has built these reactors , as long as you &apos;ve already had fast reactors , it could be the first nuclear waste ever built .
and you see , what about the time and possibility of this project ?
Gates : build a massive power plant , and it costs a very low amount of money to build a huge power plant , and it costs us about 20 years to invent .
this is about the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ end version of our environmental model , and this is basically what our environment looks like .
it would be very easy to meet if everything was going fine , and it would be very easy to meet , if it didn &apos;t work , and it would be very easy to meet .
there &apos;s a company at the moment that &apos;s been working on this , and we need to figure out , if they &apos;re going to work out , if they &apos;re going to have any money , they &apos;re going to have to compete .
and if it &apos;s successful , it &apos;s best because it can be used in multiple ways .
but we need at least one to succeed .
if there &apos;s a massive innovation on this , it &apos;s the biggest innovation you know .
Gates : the breakthrough for energy is the most important thing .
even if there &apos;s no environmental limitations , it &apos;s going to be the most important question of the environment , it &apos;s going to be much more pressing .
in nuclear , there are other inventors .
but I didn &apos;t know what they were doing , and we didn &apos;t know that some people were innovation in the module , and that was another way .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that &apos;s kind of hard to do , but maybe they look at our way .
so there &apos;s a lot of different ways to do this , but the beauty of nuclear energy is that there &apos;s a lot of different energy in it , like the coal , but nuclear is a million times the beauty of nuclear , and there &apos;s an enormous amount of potential in it , if you can process it , for example , for radiation , for radiation , for negative energy .
Moderator : what if we hadn &apos;t succeeded ?
what kind of heat do we need to take to make sure that the temperature is stable ?
Gates : what if things were to grow up to that point , like eating too much , could you have a heart attack ? you might need heart surgery .
there &apos;s a study called geo @-@ engineered technology to try to slow down global warming for 20 to 30 years .
but that &apos;s like a insurance policy .
you don &apos;t want to use it .
some people say there &apos;s no need to study insurance , because it &apos;s going to keep you from eating , but you know that the heart can save you .
and if you think about the importance of the problem , I don &apos;t know if this is so wise to talk about the earth as a backup plan , in case it &apos;s going to get worse , or later on .
Moderator : how would you convince them of climate change , if you convince them of climate change ?
Gates : unfortunately , the skeptics come from different camps .
very few of them have scientific evidence .
and what they said was that the effect of the cloud is because of the cloud , they said the result of the cloud was caused by the cloud .
they have very few compelling evidence that even one in a million .
the main question here is , it &apos;s like HIV .
now , to make a mistake , you have to double your suffering .
so when you &apos;ve got an urge to do it now , you &apos;ve got a pain in the future , and you &apos;ve got an uncertain pain , the IPCC report , it &apos;s not the worst of any reports , and somebody in the developed world looked at it , and it &apos;s not the big deal .
in fact , uncertainty should lead us to working on this .
but my wish is , if you add energy to the economy , and you <unk> CO2 emissions , but my wish is , if you make energy affordable , you make it affordable , and then the <unk> says , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care more about carbon dioxide . &quot;
but I &apos;m going to take this new approach , because energy is cheaper than ever before , and that is to say , if you look at something like <unk> , which means that if you spend all your energy trying to solve CO2 problems , then you &apos;re going to replace all the other things that are more important to solve CO2 , which is that we &apos;re going to replace the world of poverty .
J Not much , though the United States should be spending more than 100 million dollars a year on this , which should not have an effect on other things : the R &amp; amp ; D effort on R &amp; amp ; D. ) So this isn &apos;t going to affect the fact that the United States should have a huge amount of money .
Gates : the actual R &amp; amp ; D effort doesn &apos;t really matter .
for a career , if it &apos;s not affordable , for me , it &apos;s essentially a waste of money , and there &apos;s a difference between what needs to happen , and if it &apos;s not affordable , for me , it &apos;s a sense that some people may disagree about what needs to be , and if it &apos;s not affordable , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s right .
unless you &apos;ve been very close to success , and you &apos;re investing in the portfolio , and it &apos;s going to be very cheap , until you &apos;ve been very close to success , and you &apos;re investing in the portfolio , and it &apos;s going to become very cheap , and I think we should try to have a solution to the potential , I think we should try to have a low @-@ cost solution .
if you &apos;re going to solve the climate , you &apos;re going to make it incredibly expensive , you &apos;re going to get rich , you &apos;re going to get rich , you &apos;re going to get efficient , you &apos;re going to get rich .
for those of you in the room , if the costs are five times more , it doesn &apos;t affect the way we live our lives , for those of you who sit , it doesn &apos;t matter whether we &apos;re five times more .
but for the two billion people on Earth , that &apos;s a disaster .
and the idea of <unk> has changed , and his argument now is that research has not gotten more attention .
and the idea of <unk> has changed , and his argument now is that research has not gotten more attention .
it was a very lonely camp for history , but he was aware that it was a rather lonely camp for reasons , because of history , he was a <unk> camp , but he had realized that that that was a rather lonely camp , he was a very lonely camp .
and I think that &apos;s a very interesting subject to this , because there &apos;s a lot of money involved in science .
and I think that &apos;s a very interesting subject to this , because there &apos;s a lot of money involved in science .
Bill , I think most of us here , really wish your dream , thank you very much .
J Thank you .
a few years ago at TED , Peter <unk> introduced a design challenge called the <unk> Challenge .
it &apos;s a very simple idea that a group of four people who have a single individual team of four people who have a single building , a single @-@ purpose material , a piece of cotton called <unk> , a rope @-@ .
the cotton has to be on the top .
it &apos;s not easy , it &apos;s not easy , because it requires people to quickly collaborate .
and I think this is an interesting idea that I put it in a design conference .
and it was pretty successful .
and since then , I &apos;ve been working on more than 70 design programs around the world , with students and designers , and architects and even wealth @-@ free technologies , and this practice has given us a profound lesson in many ways to teach us how to collaborate , and I &apos;ve shared some of these with you .
normally , people always start talking about doing this .
they were talking about what would happen , and they were arguing about what they were right or wrong .
and then they spent a little bit of time planning , and they took a look at the drawings , and they took the pasta .
they used a lot of time to assemble spaghetti sauce into a lot of time .
and then finally , the time was finished , and they took the cotton candy and they put it on the top , and then they took a step back , and they looked at it .
but most of the time , what really happened was that the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> got really bad , because the weight of the cotton candy gave the structure .
some of them , they got worse and worse than others , and the worst of all was the new business school .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re very easy to interfere with their <unk> .
and of course there are teams who have created more <unk> , which are the best of all , which are the new kindergarten kids .
it &apos;s just phenomenal .
as Laura Lee told us , they built the highest building , and they built the structure as well .
so what do you ask them ? what do they have ?
and Peter likes to say this : because there &apos;s no child who wants to be the CEO of a <unk> company in Italy .
they didn &apos;t spend any time on power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
because college students are trained to find the right thing .
and then they follow the plan .
but the truth is , when they put the cotton at the top , they took a finite amount of time , and what happened ?
the crisis came .
listen to that ? yes .
the kindergarten kids do different things , and they start with the cotton candy , and they take a prototype model , and then they keep on using it , and they keep it on the top , so they always have a lot of opportunity to do it .
and so the designer realized that this partnership was a key ingredient in this interaction .
for every version , the child will quickly get feedback , they know what to do , what doesn &apos;t work .
so the capability of the prototype is real key , and let &apos;s see how different teams work .
the average height of most of the <unk> tower is 20 feet high , and the average school student , about half a dozen lawyers , but not anywhere in kindergarten , better than most adults .
who does it best ?
architects and engineers , thank God .
the highest tower I &apos;ve ever met is 39 inches .
why ? because they understand that triangles and their own models are the key to stability in architecture .
the president is a little bit better than average , but the interesting thing is that it &apos;s fun .
and if you add them in their group , they get a lot better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around , you say , &quot; <unk> won . &quot;
you already know , why ?
because they have special simplicity .
they manage the process . they understand the processes .
so in short , any groups are more engaged and focused on the work itself , there &apos;s a dramatic increase in performance .
the special skills and the combination of simplicity has led to success .
if you &apos;ve got 10 people in this campaign , about six of them can build structures that can stand upright .
I made an interesting try .
and I thought , let &apos;s make that bet .
so I gave you 100,000 dollars @-@ worth of software , and I gave it to groups of people .
can you guess what happens to the students who design it ?
what happens ?
and that &apos;s the result : there &apos;s not a single group that has built a standing building .
and even if any one of these guys had an inch in an inch , they could put a <unk> back in .
so , what &apos;s interesting is that there &apos;s a lot of money going on .
and then we repeated this campaign in the same students .
and guess what ?
and here they see the value of the <unk> model .
so the worst group became the best team .
they took the tiniest amount of time , the tallest building .
and it really <unk> the sense of reward and success for all of us .
so , you might ask yourself , &quot; How can somebody spend their time writing a cotton problem ? &quot;
and the reason for that is that I can use <unk> and processes to help people build cars , video games and visualization .
and the challenge of the cotton candy is to recognize some assumptions that are hidden .
because , frankly , every project has its own cotton candy .
and the challenge is to give you the experience of a common language .
it &apos;s this simple exercise that gives us valuable experience .
if you &apos;re interested , you can go to <unk>
this is a blog you can read , and tell you how to build cotton .
there &apos;s a specific process .
there &apos;s also strange examples from around the world that people can adjust the system .
there &apos;s a world record there .
and I believe that the fundamental nature of design is actually a form of communication .
it requires us to take all of our <unk> and put them into the task , to ask us to use the best mental state of mind , our sense of action , to welcome our challenge .
and at some point , an experience of a small model will help us turn it into a moment where the minute it is , it &apos;s time for us to break it down .
and the result is huge .
thank you .
let &apos;s imagine a machine here .
it &apos;s a big , cool , TED machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
everybody &apos;s going to walk into this time .
you can choose to go back to the past or to the future , which is not the present .
and I &apos;m thinking about what you &apos;re going to do , and I &apos;ve asked my friends a couple of times more about this , and their answer has been back to the past .
I don &apos;t understand . they say , go back to the age of no cars or Twitter .
I don &apos;t really understand .
I &apos;m sure there must be some <unk> or some <unk> .
and I can understand that .
but I had to acknowledge that I wasn &apos;t a mess with them .
I didn &apos;t want to go back . I didn &apos;t want to take risks .
it &apos;s because the probability of the Earth , it &apos;s not something that you can go to the future .
in other words , I wanted to walk into this machine and go into the future .
our age is the best of all times , whether you look at it in any way , like health , mobility , opportunity rates go down .
never before .
my grandparents died at the age of 60 .
my grandparents died in their 70s .
my parents died when they died .
I wanted to be dead at the beginning of a nine @-@ digit number .
but it &apos;s not just about us , because it &apos;s bigger than us .
a child born in Delhi today can be as brilliant as 100 years ago .
think about it . it &apos;s an amazing fact .
why does this happen ?
because we killed smallpox . smallpox killed hundreds of millions of people on the planet .
it <unk> the population of the Earth , and it is impossible to see any war .
but it &apos;s been wiped out today .
it &apos;s a man who <unk> it .
in a modern , rich society today , just one generation ago , there was almost no longer a threat of life .
there &apos;s almost no reason why we don &apos;t have polio .
do you know what those names mean ?
vaccines and modern medicine and humans have been able to provide food for millions of people , both for science .
it seems to me that the scientific method is an ongoing trial , a process of change , and it &apos;s one of the greatest <unk> of humankind .
so these are the good news .
but unfortunately , the good news is so much , because we &apos;ve also met some other problems , many times .
one of them is , although we &apos;ve come up with great progress , there &apos;s a billion people in the world that live in hunger , they suffer from hunger every day .
the numbers are coming up , and the speed is coming up very quickly , and this is enough to get us <unk> .
not only that , but the imagination of the human imagination brought huge garbage .
drinking water , tropical rainforest , oil , gas , gas , all these resources are disappearing and disappearing , and unless we understand innovation , we don &apos;t have any hope .
the question is : can we do it ? I think we can .
I think we can produce enough food for billions of people , and not damage the land where they live .
and I think we can find <unk> energy to supply the world &apos;s energy .
I do believe that that &apos;s true , that &apos;s not true .
but I &apos;ve always come across things that I can &apos;t sleep at night . this is one of the things that makes me fall asleep , and there &apos;s never been a need for technologies like this .
and we haven &apos;t had the opportunity to use these technologies in our history .
in many of the fields , we were all standing in the midst of an amazing discovery , and in fact , I think we need to look back , 30 years ago , back in the Renaissance , and only in the early days when people were fighting to survive , someone was more violent than we were today .
people always like to put themselves in their own framework , and they kill themselves so often that they can &apos;t die .
they can &apos;t get them shaking .
listen , everybody can hold his point , and they can even insist on their point of progress .
but do you know what you can &apos;t stick with ?
you can &apos;t just stick with what you know . you can &apos;t .
it took me a while to learn .
about 10 years ago , I wrote a story to The New Yorker about a small vaccine .
but what I discovered was that there was such an <unk> against me that they were against the most effective public health measures in human history .
I really don &apos;t know what to do , and I just do what I do . the story says , I do something else .
shortly afterwards , I wrote an article on <unk> food .
and then there was a huge amount of resistance , which was bigger than once .
people were crazy .
so I also wrote an article on that , and I couldn &apos;t really understand why people would understand this as <unk> food for evil , and I don &apos;t understand why people would think that in a certain way , rather than in any way , living molecules are natural .
but I was just going to do what I needed to do , and I ended up writing anyway .
I &apos;m a journalist .
our work is to write , publish , eat , and that &apos;s our life .
but I didn &apos;t know what it was , until then I knew what it was .
and the ones that kept me nuts were not actually <unk> molecules .
they &apos;re people who have ideas , people who have educated , who have integrity .
they &apos;re like people in this room .
it really bothers me .
and I thought , let &apos;s face it .
our age has become different from where we are today .
we &apos;re seeing progress in a very curious way .
we &apos;re going to talk about progress in the ironic context , and in quote , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and I think there &apos;s a reason for that , and we know what it is .
our institutions , for civil society , are sometimes for government , sometimes for science , have lost trust , and maybe we have reason to do not believe .
just to give you a few names , you know what happened .
Chernobyl , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the weapons of mass destruction , the semi @-@ saturated votes .
I think you can put a list in your mind .
we &apos;ve had a completely trust in the past , and it &apos;s a problem now . so people should have a bit skeptical .
ask a couple of questions , ask for evidence and evidence .
you can &apos;t believe anything .
but one thing to notice is that when you get the evidence , you need to take the evidence , but we &apos;re not good at it .
and the reason for that , I think , is that we now have an epidemic of fear , an epidemic of infectious disease and depth that I &apos;ve never experienced , and I don &apos;t want to go into .
12 years ago , the media had written a message , which was a very scary news , and it was taking the autism and the <unk> and the <unk> vaccine .
it &apos;s really scary .
so there &apos;s a lot of research going on around that .
there &apos;s a need to do this , because it &apos;s a serious event .
and the data came out .
from the United States , Sweden , Canada &apos;s data <unk> the same conclusion that autism and vaccines don &apos;t have any contact , haven &apos;t been connected .
but that turns out there &apos;s not a lot of sense to the public , because we like to listen to small stories , and we believe that we see our eyes , and believe that what we see in our hearts , we believe that we see is true .
but it &apos;s not believed that a stack of documents that didn &apos;t believe the data from the government , and I could understand that , I think , all of us have this kind of psychological .
but what happens ?
the consequences are unbelievable .
listen to this fact : Americans are the only country in the world where measles was failing .
it &apos;s enough for us to be ashamed , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s a terrible thing .
what caused this happen ?
now I got it . I really got it .
who here has measles ?
have you ever seen someone else &apos;s death for measles ?
no more , no more .
in fact , it &apos;s not going to happen in this country , but in the last year , 16 million people have died because of measles .
the numbers are enormous , and basically 20 people every hour die .
but because it didn &apos;t happen to us , we could do it any matter , like the people on the TV show could still be transmitted to their fears and ignorance .
and the reason they did this is because they didn &apos;t put the reason together .
and they didn &apos;t know that the things that looked like were actually the same .
we need lessons from all of that , and we need to learn better .
this guy , <unk> <unk> , is a hero .
because of the vaccine that was invented to get people to avoid the worst disaster .
now people don &apos;t need to be afraid of this disease , and they don &apos;t have the pain , they disappear .
that guy in the middle is not that old .
he &apos;s called Paul <unk> .
he and a couple of other researchers have developed three million doses of vaccine .
this vaccine , every year , saves four billion children in developing countries .
it should be good , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s great . this is Paul going to tell people about this vaccine everywhere , and say how good they are , how good they are , how better they can be .
he did .
so we think of Paul as the terrorists .
when Paul came to the trial , he had to be armed with armed guards .
he would get a call at home because people would tell him where his child was going to school .
why ? because Paul invented a vaccine .
I don &apos;t have to talk about this , but vaccines are really important .
and once the vaccine stops , the disease comes back and it &apos;s a terrible disease , and this happens .
now the United States has measles .
and it gets worse and worse , and very soon , there &apos;s children dying of this disease , which is just a digital problem .
not just measles .
and polio , who dare say it doesn &apos;t happen again ?
one of my students at the University of university wrote a letter to me a couple of weeks ago , and she said I was a little too picky .
no one ever said that before .
she said she wasn &apos;t going to vaccinate children . she certainly wouldn &apos;t .
all right .
why ? because there &apos;s no polio in this country , but you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have this disease yesterday .
today , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know , maybe one of the people in the community , and his destination was Los Angeles airport .
and a few hours later , he would get to the ground , and he would come up to Long Beach , and he would come to a TED dinner .
he didn &apos;t know that he was infected with polio , and we didn &apos;t know it was the world .
the fact that we have here is this : don &apos;t think it &apos;s true .
we love believing lies . we all love to do that .
did each of you take vitamin ?
or if you &apos;re feeling intense , or maybe even a little bit of <unk> , it &apos;s only when you &apos;re feeling intense .
and the reason you do that is because half of Americans do this every day .
they eat this , they eat it , they eat it , even though we already know that these things don &apos;t work .
that &apos;s what the data says .
it just makes your urine dark , and it doesn &apos;t work .
if you &apos;re willing to spend billions of dollars to get some black urine , you &apos;re going to get some black .
I was not averse .
it &apos;s black urine , it &apos;s black .
why do we do that ? why ?
and I thought maybe I could understand . we have a huge problem in this country .
and we all hate big government , because we don &apos;t trust people in that .
but we don &apos;t have to do that . we have poor healthcare systems .
that &apos;s a cruel system for millions of people .
and for those who can afford it , it &apos;s also a form of <unk> and ruthless medical system .
so we had to figure out how to escape this . where do we go ?
we made a huge commitment to placebo .
this is a wonderful job . Oh , I love placebo .
but you know , this was a serious thing because it was a big thing , but we had hundreds of millions of dollars to buy placebo .
I &apos;ve got all kinds of samples here .
none of them work , whether it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is , but we spend billions of dollars to buy them , which is deception .
but you know what ? when I was talking about this , people scream at me . they would say , &quot; Well , you know , what &apos;s wrong with you ? let &apos;s get people to do it . &quot;
eat placebo , at least it makes you feel sick . &quot;
you know ? you &apos;re wrong .
I &apos;m not going to make it easy . if the American health and the public minister of medicine said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t care if the experts ever found the evidence for breast X number , &quot; or a cancer reader who wants to be treated by coffee .
if you believe in belief and magic , you end up going to a place where you don &apos;t want to go .
maybe you will end up being the leader of South Africa .
he insisted that <unk> and <unk> were more effective than the anti @-@ AIDS anti @-@ AIDS anti @-@ AIDS drugs , and that killed 40,000 people because of HIV .
thousands of people who don &apos;t need to die , and that &apos;s where the most severe HIV infection in the world .
please don &apos;t tell me that these examples aren &apos;t going to happen .
and the consequences are , always there .
now , the most ignorance epidemic we &apos;ve got is the result of genetically engineered crops and <unk> in two camps .
it &apos;s also a stupid argument . we have to stop that argument .
because arguments are just words and metaphor .
it &apos;s about ideology , not about scientific arguments .
everything that we have in our stomach , every one of us , every one of them , every one of them , has been changed by Brussels <unk> .
there were no orange in the garden .
there &apos;s no <unk> .
there &apos;s no Christmas tree . it &apos;s all made @-@ up .
humans have built these things in the last 11 years .
some trials succeeded , some of them failed .
and the ones that failed were difficult .
and now we can do this in a more precise way , and that &apos;s certainly risky , but we can put vitamin A.
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
I just said , I don &apos;t understand that .
a lot of us are against genetically modified foods .
why ?
the reason I hear a lot about this is that there &apos;s so much chemistry , too much pesticides , too much hormones , hormones , testosterone , that we don &apos;t really want to make the same crops , that &apos;s fine .
we don &apos;t want to make commercial companies patent for a new crop .
we also didn &apos;t want to let the big company <unk> .
can you imagine the response to these objections ?
well , guess right , let &apos;s get the solution together .
well , we had a very serious food problem , but that &apos;s not science .
because it &apos;s not science .
this is the issue of law , ethics , patent law .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
not even an idea , it &apos;s a process .
and it &apos;s sometimes successful and sometimes failing , but because we &apos;re afraid that we shouldn &apos;t have scientists to go and learn how to do things that are horrible , and that will prevent millions of people from getting to prosperity .
in the next 50 years , we need to grow 70 percent more food than we are today .
this is the total investment we &apos;ve spent the last 30 years in Africa .
it &apos;s reassuring .
the people there need this , but we don &apos;t .
why ? because of genetically engineered food .
we didn &apos;t encourage people to eat the wrong food , such as the <unk> .
there are 5,000 people in the world who eat <unk> .
that &apos;s a crop that looks like a potato .
it &apos;s only calories , it tastes bad .
there &apos;s no nutrition , there &apos;s no protein , there &apos;s a scientist trying to put these up into the <unk> .
you can avoid being blind by the guy who has modified it .
you &apos;re not going to starve .
that &apos;s good . it &apos;s not as good as restaurants , but it &apos;s good .
and I just said , &quot; Why are some people against this ? &quot;
ask yourself , why are we against ?
because we don &apos;t want to move the genome ?
this is just moving some genomes , nothing related to adding chemicals .
it doesn &apos;t matter . we always want to get larger food , better food , more food .
it &apos;s not about <unk> meters , it &apos;s just about trying to get some live off , and it &apos;s time for us to take it seriously .
you know what ?
and if we don &apos;t do that , and stick with it , we &apos;re going to have a future where we don &apos;t want to happen , and we &apos;re going to have high @-@ tech <unk> .
no other word is more appropriate to describe it .
this is a selfish , <unk> , doing this just reducing our dignity , and we have to stop doing that .
all right , and after a very interesting conversation , you might say , you know , you &apos;re going to walk into this machine , and you &apos;re going to go to the future ?
of course . I would certainly .
it &apos;s a machine that &apos;s parked right now , but we have a great opportunity .
we can build any time machine .
we can go there . we can go there .
we need to start having conversations like this , and we need to think , when we enter the time machine and the future , we will be happy with our choices .
and I believe that we can , and that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
yeah .
and for a while I was interested in <unk> , a magician would not be interested in a placebo , but if you think from my career , it &apos;s to make something real , to make people believe that they &apos;re true .
in other words , there &apos;s a drug that you can measure in some studies , and what &apos;s called a placebo effect , because people think that what happens to them is a drug , or give an example of a drug for a drug called <unk> if they believe it &apos;s a drug , there &apos;s obviously a placebo .
fake things become real because people understand it .
to understand each other , I want to start showing you a very simple , simple magic .
and I would also tell you how I became , and this was the simple magic that came from every child in the &apos; 50s .
when I was in the 1970s , I learned it from magic to child soldiers .
I &apos;ll just show you , and then I &apos;ll explain .
and I &apos;ll conclude by why I want to explain .
see , it &apos;s magic .
this knife , you can check it ; my hand , you can check it .
and that &apos;s what I did .
and I brush my sleeve up .
and to make sure that nothing can go up and down my sleeve , I &apos;m just going to push my wrist .
so you can see there &apos;s no time for anything to do , and as long as I can remember , there &apos;s nothing to do with my sleeve .
it &apos;s very simple .
and I &apos;m going to open up my palm hoping that if everything &apos;s going to work , my body will stick to this knife .
in fact , it was so tight that I could even shake the knife .
nothing in my sleeve , no tricks . you can look at everything .
all right .
well , it &apos;s a magic child that I often teach kids about magic , because you can learn a lot about deception by learning about magic -- even though it &apos;s a very simple magic trick .
there &apos;s a lot of people here who know this magic .
it happened .
I had this knife in my hand .
I said I &apos;m going to grab my wrist to make sure there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , which is a lie .
and the reason I hold my wrist is because of the secret of the <unk> .
and when I move your hand up to you in the middle of my hand , this finger , and my index goes from here to here , to the right spot .
okay .
there were a lot of people sitting there who hadn &apos;t had a childhood .
that &apos;s how my finger moved , from here , right .
as I rotate my hand , my fingers are moving .
we can talk about why this has been liar , and why don &apos;t you note that only three fingers beneath this , because your mind , and the way we process consciousness , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three . it <unk> them .
but that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to talk about today . right ? I &apos;m going to open my palm up .
obviously it &apos;s lined up there , not through any physiological magnet , but through deception , my <unk> .
and I would shake my fingers , and again , as I would , I would hide my fingers at some point .
shake the hand . you take the knife .
this trick you can do with your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with a placebo ?
I read a study about a year ago , and it opened my understanding .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this was a surprising thing to me .
it shows that if you give people a placebo in the form of a placebo sugar pill , like aspirin , if it &apos;s a circle of white pills , it has a measurable effect .
but if you change the form of placebo sugar , for example , you take it into a small pill , and paint it in blue , and it has a much more measurable effect .
even though none of them have any real medicine -- they &apos;re all <unk> .
but white pills are no blue .
what ? it really confused me .
but in fact , that &apos;s not the end .
if you take the capsule , they work more than any form of pills .
there &apos;s a color capsule , a yellow one , and the red one on the other side is more effective than a white capsule .
the dose was done .
one day two , one didn &apos;t get much work . I &apos;m sorry .
but the point is .
and the dose is about medicine .
<unk> form and medicine .
if you want to have extreme <unk> , you need an injection of <unk> .
right ? one or two <unk> with a syringe , you inject it into a patient .
in their mind , it &apos;s such a powerful idea that it should be much better than white pills .
it &apos;s a very strong imagination , and when I have the slide , I can show you the statistics .
the point is that white pills don &apos;t have blue pills ; there &apos;s no <unk> .
they don &apos;t really have medicine . it &apos;s just your belief that makes it real , and it makes it more robust to you .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to magic tricks .
there &apos;s some obvious tricks that make it real .
we know from the study that if you want to have a fish , you have a <unk> .
this is a <unk> cap . it &apos;s very sharp . I &apos;m going to take it down .
this is my muscle . this is not a <unk> .
this is my skin . this is not a Hollywood effect .
and I &apos;m going to stick it through my skin and bring it over the other side .
if you &apos;re ever more nervous -- if you &apos;re easy to remember -- I showed some friends yesterday in the hotel , some people I didn &apos;t know , there was a woman who almost died .
so , I would suggest that if you could easily see anywhere in the next 30 seconds , actually , you know , I would start doing bad things at the back .
you &apos;ll see , you can see if you want to .
well , this is what happened , right here in my arms under my arms , and I made a small hole .
sorry . I &apos;m scared of you ?
just walk through my skin in one way .
now , we &apos;re basically in the same position as a knife .
pretty much .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers now , right ?
so let me show them . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah . Oh .
I know what people want when they see this .
and they said , &quot; Oh , he &apos;s not going to be able to tap his skin and play with us for a few minutes . &quot;
so let me peek at you .
so what does that look like ? good .
I know .
and the people in the background said , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t really see that . I don &apos;t really see that . I don &apos;t see it . &quot;
people in the remote room are now capable of filtering .
let me take a closer look at this .
this is actually my skin . this is not a Hollywood effect .
that &apos;s my meat . I can rotate it .
sorry . if you feel disgust , look elsewhere , forget this .
the person at the back , or a few years later , looked at this from the video and said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a little bit missing effect , but if it &apos;s real , there &apos;s a hole , there &apos;s a hole , if it &apos;s real bleed .
let me give you my blood .
yes , that &apos;s it .
and normally I would take the needle out .
I would wash my arms and show you that I didn &apos;t get hurt .
but I think that in this case , things that come from this point of view become real things , and I &apos;m going to stop there .
I &apos;ll see you in the next couple of days .
I want you to look forward . thank you very much .
everybody was talking about pleasure lately .
in the last five years , I &apos;ve asked the number of people to come up with more books in recent years , about 40 years , and then more than that .
more and more researchers today are starting to get interested in happiness .
and there &apos;s a lot of happy teachers who teach them .
making other people happy is their goal .
and while these kinds of jobs continue to be part of the cognitive trap , these trap will increase the difficulty of happiness .
I &apos;m going to focus on these cognitive trap .
these trap effects that normal people think about their happiness , and that it also affects the moral judgments of the scholars , because we &apos;re all wrong .
the first trap is not to admit the complexity of happiness .
as it turns out , pleasure is no longer a word of regular words , because we have so much to interpret .
I think we should define what it means , but generally , we have to give up this idea of what it &apos;s like to live in a more complex way .
the second trap is the association between experience and memory , which is basically the experience of pleasure and pleasure in life , and the difference between your life .
and the two meanings were <unk> away from the waist down .
and the third trap is the illusion , <unk> , in any case , when we think about something about pleasure , we feel it very important .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
it &apos;s <unk> .
now , I want to start with an example of one of my personal <unk> , one of my <unk> <unk> told me a story . &#91; unclear &#93; &#91; unclear &#93; , he said that he was hearing music when he was listening to a symphony , but at the end of the performance , the <unk> had fallen voices .
and then he was so excited that this was a mouse that had broken the horse .
but it wasn &apos;t .
and what &apos;s happening is that it &apos;s only memory of that experience .
he experienced this experience .
and he went through 20 minutes of hearing contests .
but now it &apos;s a little bit smaller now , because the <unk> left a memory ; it &apos;s that bad memory , and the other 20 @-@ minute prizes are totally forgotten .
and this tells us , we &apos;ve used two types of ourselves when we think of ourselves and other people .
the first one is self @-@ experience , and the self is living in the present , and the idea is , at the same time , but basically he &apos;s from the present moment .
now , what happens is the experience of the doctor -- as the doctor asked you , do I touch you when I touch you here ?
another self is a memory , and he &apos;s in charge of his life , and he &apos;s in charge of his life , and he &apos;s looking for him , and he says , &quot; How does he feel so recently ? &quot;
or will it be fun to go to Italy , or something like that ?
the experience of self and memory is completely different , and the combination of those two is the cause of happiness .
remember , it &apos;s about telling stories .
and the story starts with our memories -- the actual upload .
it &apos;s not the stories we &apos;re telling .
it &apos;s a story of our memories that we have within our experience .
let me start with an example .
this is an ancient study .
some of the real patients are going to be receiving a treatment .
details go back to details . today &apos;s therapies are no longer true , but when it &apos;s done in the 1990s , it &apos;s a terrible solution .
every six seconds , the patient has to report their pain index .
here are two patients . this is their record .
and I asked you , &quot; Who &apos;s most painful in them ? &quot;
the problem is simple .
obviously , the patient was B. He had a <unk> with a <unk> tree , and the patient &apos;s <unk> node A feels for a minute , and B is sustained .
but there &apos;s another question : do these patients think they &apos;re suffering ?
here &apos;s a little accident .
and the amazing thing about this is that the patient &apos;s memory of a <unk> is actually worse than the patient .
the story of two meters is different , and the end of the story is the gap .
both stories don &apos;t spark intelligence -- but obviously they &apos;re different .
one of them obviously felt worse than another .
it felt worse , and it wasn &apos;t a good story for the very last period .
how did we know that ?
because we asked them at the end of the session , and we asked them one more time later , what do you think of as a <unk> ?
it turns out that A &apos;s memory is obviously worse than B.
now this is the direct conflict between self and memory .
from the experience self @-@ experience , the patient is obviously a little bit miserable .
so how do we actually do a clinical trial , and when we do this , we get the result , in fact , that we can extended the patient over A &apos;s time to slow down the flow of machinery .
the patient still hurts a lot .
and if you continue this way , you would make the patient &apos;s experience worse , but the patient &apos;s memory is better , because you gave the patient a better story , a better memory , a better memory .
how do you define good stories ?
and it &apos;s true , and it &apos;s true , and it &apos;s true .
the good news is it takes a few moments to end .
at the end , it &apos;s important that the story on top is led by the end .
now , experience itself as a result of that experience .
he had a moment of experience , one after another .
and you say , what about all of this ?
and the answer is simple . they disappear forever .
most of our lives -- I &apos;ll just take a second round of psychology -- three seconds from a psychology point of view , and that means there &apos;s about three thousand moments of human life , and in a month , there &apos;s about three thousand of them left .
most of these memories are completely ignored .
and yet , you can now see that some of the feelings are stored , because every moment in our experience , the moment @-@ by @-@ moment aspects of our life .
as long as we &apos;re alive , we &apos;re going to consume these limited resources .
it &apos;s important how to use them , it seems to be important , but it &apos;s not something that &apos;s left to us .
so memory itself and experience are great .
the biggest difference between them is the way they process time .
in the experience , if you had a holiday , the first week one was as happy as the first week , the pleasure of the week was twice the amount of vacation .
and the memory self is not that way .
for memory , two weeks , it wasn &apos;t any more than a week of vacation , because there wasn &apos;t any new kind of memories involved .
the story is still alive .
so time is the key ingredient for self @-@ expression and experience , and time doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s not just memory and telling stories .
and it &apos;s also about making decisions , because if you have two different surgical patients , you have two different types of surgeons doing this , and now it &apos;s deciding to take a look at it from one of them , the patient &apos;s chosen is better than the memory of the memory , which is how the doctor chooses .
the experience of self is to make choices and to do them .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between two experiences . we &apos;re choices in two different experiences .
and when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think about it in the form of experience .
we &apos;re going to present the future in memories .
and by and large , you can see that memory itself is a tyrant , that you can imagine that memory itself is pulling out of the experience , that he is taking the experience out of his own experience .
and I had the idea that , as we were <unk> , there was a big part of it for our own memories .
and I think that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
how much memory do we use ?
it could explain why memory itself became the dominant self .
and it reminded me of a vacation that I spent a couple of years at the South Pole , which is one of my greatest <unk> , and I often think of this vacation .
it took me about a three @-@ week trip , about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , as I opened my eyes , there &apos;s about 600 photographs in it , and I might take an hour to remember .
three weeks of traveling , it took only one and a half hours to remember .
it seemed to be out of sync .
and it got me a little bit annoyed , because I remember it &apos;s really too small , but even if you remember it , there &apos;s a real problem . why do we use memory more than we do ?
so I want you to think about an experiment about thinking .
if you were to take your next vacation , if you knew that all of the photographs that were destroyed at the end of the vacation would be destroyed , and you would also swallow a forgotten drug to you .
do you think about the same vacation ?
and if you take a different kind of vacation between two of your own self , you have to figure out how to judge this conflict , and it &apos;s not very easy , because if you only have time you &apos;ve got one answer . but if you only think about it , you get another answer .
the question that we have to ask is , why don &apos;t we just want to take our choices between the two selves ?
now , two selves have different ideas about pleasure .
these two different insights into happiness corresponds to two selves .
so you say , &quot; How happy is it ? how happy is it ? &quot;
and then you say , &quot; How happy is it ? how happy is it ? &quot;
the process of these moments of pleasure is complex .
how do we measure emotions ?
by the way , we now have a rough idea of self @-@ experience as time is given .
and the memories of self are completely irrelevant .
it &apos;s not a question of how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s a question of how happy it is .
different insights .
and if you can &apos;t tell the difference between these two sets of ideas , I &apos;ve been studying pleasure as well as other students who live in a long time , and that &apos;s why .
in recent years , self @-@ experience and experience the difference between the self @-@ experience and the quality of our experience is to identify the two .
there &apos;s a poll that was recently conducted around the world where over half a million people have asked a question like this , which is how they see their lives and how they experience it , except for this issue , this company has done other surveys .
in recent years , we &apos;ve learned about two types of happiness .
and I think the main lesson that we &apos;ve learned is that they vary .
and you can tell if one person is happy to live , but you can &apos;t tell you how happy they are , and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the connection , they &apos;re only about 50 percent related .
that means when you see someone , you &apos;re told that his dad has <unk> high enough , can you know how tall this guy was ?
well , you might have a basic idea , but very uncertain .
you couldn &apos;t define it .
if I were to say that somebody had written their own life mass , he played eight / 10 , you couldn &apos;t grasp how happy they were .
so the connection is very low .
we know what makes people happy .
we know that money is important , it &apos;s important .
we know that happiness is something that takes place through the people we love , the time and the people that stay with them .
there are other factors , but this is the main factor .
so if you want to make both of them happy , you have to throw them away and do something different .
I mean , we should at least be <unk> as happiness .
that &apos;s the difference .
now , one of the reasons why we don &apos;t understand the nature of happiness is that we see life differently than we do .
so when you ask people in California how happy they are , you don &apos;t get the right answer .
because when you have a situation like this , you think it &apos;s a little bit pleasant , and you live in Ohio .
when you want to live in California with a lot of pleasure , you think of the differences between California and other <unk> , like climate .
it turns out that the climate conditions are not important , and it &apos;s not important to think about how happy it is to judge ourselves .
now , since the real self @-@ dominated , some people might have come to the conclusion that it &apos;s moving to California .
they moved to California for a better life , and they were tracking what was going to be a pretty interesting thing .
their experience is not going to be happier .
we all know that .
but one of the things that happened was that they thought they were happy , because when they thought about it , they came to Ohio &apos;s state of affairs , and they felt that they made the right decision .
it &apos;s really hard to understand how happy life is , and I hope I &apos;ve given you a basic idea of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . I have a question to ask you .
thank you very much .
a couple of weeks ago , we had a telephone , and you heard a fascinating phenomenon from the Gallup Organization .
can you share it with us ? we have a couple of minutes .
Daniel <unk> : okay .
I found a very intriguing number from the Gallup Organization , which I found in the Gallup world .
we found a phenomenon about self @-@ experience .
that &apos;s how much people feel when they have income .
and it turns out that , for those of you who are living in less than one year , that &apos;s a lot of them , and they &apos;re pretty close to 60 million people , and they &apos;re quite mature .
<unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
people who earn less of a year are less happy , and they &apos;re happier than they are .
and when you get more than 60,000 , we get a standard .
it &apos;s a very nice way to see a flat line .
obviously money doesn &apos;t buy experience , but it doesn &apos;t have money for you , and we know the depth of the pain , the depth of the pain , the clarity of the pain .
and for another self , memory itself , you have a narrative for the other .
the more you make , the more you get .
it doesn &apos;t have any contact with emotion .
yet , life , liberty and pursuit of pleasure is the goal of all Americans .
if you look at that carefully , it &apos;s going to turn our ideas into things like <unk> policies .
could the political figures in this country look like this and see it on the right and on ?
<unk> : I think there &apos;s a sense of what pleasure looks like in the policy @-@ making policy .
but that &apos;s an idea that we don &apos;t have any idea of , but it &apos;s in Britain , and it &apos;s contributing to the rest of the world .
and you start to realize that when you start to look at policy , you start thinking about pleasure as well .
and while this is going to take a moment , people are going to start thinking about it , and what they &apos;re going to do is they &apos;re going to experience it , and so quickly we &apos;re going to understand it .
it &apos;s a way of <unk> pleasure , but it &apos;s a lot of other ways to think about how you think , and what you think about is that memory is still about self @-@ experience .
and I think that within a few years , this will affect policy .
America has paid a tremendous amount of effort to measure the pleasant experience .
I think that in 10 or 20 years , this will be part of the country data .
the issue for me would be the most policy issue in the next few years .
thank you very much for creating behavioral economics .
thank you very much , Daniel <unk> .
my name is <unk> . I am a game designer .
I &apos;ve been playing online games for 10 years , and the goal of my decade for the decade is to be able to make it as easy to play with game games .
now , the reason I want to explain to you why I say this is that if you look at bigger , better games , including those of you in this room , and spend more time in the game , you think I &apos;m more persuasive .
these people now play online games for about three billion hours a week , and these people are playing online games for about three billion hours a week .
some of you may think it &apos;s too expensive to spend so many time playing games .
maybe there &apos;s a lot more going on , because there &apos;s a lot of pressing problems that we need to deal with .
and yet , according to my future research , research on issues , we spend less time on games .
three billion hours a week , the world is far less than three billion dollars a week for real @-@ world problems .
in fact , I felt that in order to live better on Earth , in fact , I felt that in order to live on a better life on Earth , we needed a lot more time .
I &apos;ve done calculations , and the game we need is <unk> billion hours per week .
maybe it &apos;s counterintuitive , but I want to repeat to that , so that the ideas that we have to understand , if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , obesity , I believe that we need to be encouraged to play video games for at least 10 years .
well , I &apos;m serious . I &apos;m not kidding .
and here &apos;s the reason why we organize this situation together , and that &apos;s why games are important for the survival of the human race .
this is a portrait taken by <unk> .
he wanted to capture some of the emotional changes in play , so he put them in front of the game .
this is the classic expression of a player .
now , if you &apos;re not a game player , you don &apos;t really see what it means to yourself in this image .
you might feel that pressing , <unk> fear , rather than the religious mind , or the focus , is the problem .
if you &apos;re a game player , you &apos;re feeling a bunch of different things in the corner of the eye , the fold of the fold of the eye , the fold of the folds around you , and this is a very optimistic sign , and the eyebrow is a sign of the fine .
that means that the player is going to get epic in the game .
you &apos;ve heard that word , OK , some of you have been a player .
this epic victory is a result , but it &apos;s very exciting to get this victory before you even think of it .
it &apos;s even beyond your imagination .
and when you do that , you will be struck by the skills of your own skill , which is the so @-@ called <unk> epic .
and this player is about to fulfill this kind of victory .
at the same time , this is in the middle of nowhere , and what we want to do is to deal with the challenges of the world , the ones that come from obstacles , the ones that come from them .
now , unfortunately , when we deal with different kinds of facts about our daily lives , what we often see is this expression .
I normally call this a &quot; <unk> &quot; to live a life @-@ threatening experience , to see if I made this out of it .
and that &apos;s the kind of <unk> I made , not the best way to live the expressions of my life .
and this is one of the older communities that I studied in California , one of my Ph.D. in Berkeley , and one of my Ph.D. &apos; s subjects was that reason why we felt that virtual reality is much better than the real world .
and it &apos;s also a lot of game play .
we feel like we can &apos;t adapt to real life in games .
and I don &apos;t think that adaptation is a success , and both of them are not on a par with success .
we do have more success in the world , but here &apos;s what we call an internal motivation , the motivation , the collaborative inspiration and collaboration .
when we &apos;re in the world , I think we can do the best of ourselves , when we see a message , we &apos;re going to be able to help someone else , and we &apos;re going to have a problem , and we &apos;re brave enough to stand up and continue to work .
but in real life , when we &apos;re confronted with failure , we don &apos;t usually feel that way .
we tend to feel overwhelmed and worry and anxiety and anxiety and anxiety and anxiety and anxiety and <unk> and <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have a game at the time , and we didn &apos;t feel it in the game .
this is what I studied when I was a graduate student .
can the game make us think , can we do anything ?
how do we take that feeling from the game to the work of reality ?
so I looked at games like &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; and they were really the ideal platform for collaborative issues .
and I noticed that some of these things were the ones that made the epic performance possible in online gaming .
the first thing is , whenever you show up online online gaming , particularly in World World War II , there &apos;s going to be a lot of different actors , and they &apos;re very confident about you , and they &apos;re going to help you save the world .
but it &apos;s not all the tasks that look like this , but it &apos;s just the ones that match your current level .
so you have the power to do it .
designers don &apos;t give you a mission that you can &apos;t do right now .
but to do that task requires you to limit the limits of your ability , so you have to do everything you can to do in World of Warcraft .
there &apos;s no audience , there &apos;s something very special and important to wait for you to do it .
and there &apos;s a lot of people in the world who can work together .
and everywhere you go , there &apos;s a thousand people waiting to be working with you to get a tough job .
and in real life , there was no such thing as a kind of ease between our fingertips , and there were thousands of partners , and there were thousands of partners in real life .
there &apos;s a wonderful story about the game , and the plot draws us , and it motivates what we do .
at the same time , there &apos;s a positive response for any effort that we &apos;ve done .
you &apos;ve heard about the rise , the rise of the hierarchy , the ability to add up to the level , to get more intelligence .
and we don &apos;t have that kind of sustainable feedback .
for example , when I walk down this stage , I don &apos;t have the ability to speak up , to speak up , to get crazy ideas , to say , 20 times more .
I didn &apos;t get any rewards in real life .
and in the network , like World of Warcraft , in World of Warcraft , like World of Warcraft and others , is a very pleasant life , because we can continue to win the final triumph , and that &apos;s because of the fact that we can play the game .
because it &apos;s better than reality .
so far , the World War II game player in World War II has spent the vast majority of its time dealing with all kinds of virtual problems in the hands of Western European nations .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
but it sounds like a bad thing .
and we wrote these numbers : our ancestors , 10,000 years ago , were upright .
this is the first upright @-@ walking primates .
so when we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend on this game , the only way to make it reasonable is to think about how much time we &apos;ve spent on human evolution , and how remarkable it is .
and to think of it this way is the right thing , because what you find is that we spend a lot of time playing games , and we can change our ability to be human .
we &apos;re moving towards a more integrated , robust species .
it &apos;s true . I believe it .
this is an interesting survey that was published by a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in an atmosphere where young people are playing in an atmosphere , a very strong atmosphere , a very strong atmosphere , where young people today are now 21 years old , and the average person is spending 10,000 hours on average .
now , 10,000 hours is an interesting value because of two reasons .
first of all , American children spend their fifth grade when they &apos;re high school , and you have to do well on time .
and we had this parallel processing data , which showed that young people were doing a good job game , and the time they spent in school was the same .
some of you must have read the latest book , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so your insights about success are not that strange , 10,000 hours of success .
the law is based on cognitive science research , and if we spend 10,000 hours on the age of 21 , we should be able to do something else , and we would be able to get a huge success on these things .
we &apos;re going to be the world @-@ class expert on anything we do .
now , what we &apos;re looking at is the full generation of young people .
the big question is , what are the game players doing ?
if we could give answers , we would be able to extract an unprecedented human resources .
they are the ones we have today that spend at least one @-@ hour online game players .
they &apos;re brilliant ; they &apos;re great ; they &apos;re good at some people .
and in the next 10 years , more than a billion people have come in .
and if I haven &apos;t heard it , I &apos;ll tell you , it &apos;s happening .
the game industry has been evolving so far , it has become available today , and it has moved from the Internet to the wireless network of mobile phone players around the world , particularly Indian , Chinese , Chinese players , Brazil .
in the next 10 years , there will be 10 billion new players in the next decade .
we had 15 game players .
so I started thinking early , where are these games going to lead us ?
and I felt like there were four things . the first was the positive idea of <unk> , the emergency .
think of it as an object that is both extremes .
the optimism of this is bringing together the urge to solve obstacles immediately .
the game players always believed that the victory was not possible .
the gamers are not isolated .
they were very good at creating social structures .
an interesting survey showed that we prefer people who play with us , even though they beat me , they did .
and the reason for that is that , in the course of the game , we accumulate trust , because in the game , we accumulate trust .
and the reason why we trust them is because they spend the same time with the same rules that we spend on , we &apos;re going to fight side by side by side .
in this case , games can actually build coordination , trust and collaboration .
and we &apos;re going to create a more robust social network .
I love the productivity of happiness .
the average World of Warcraft players , on average , spend 22 hours a week as part @-@ time games , are part @-@ time games .
it &apos;s because , when we play games , we &apos;re having a lot of pleasure , and we &apos;re having a lot of fun .
as humans , we like to do things that are hard , but it &apos;s more interesting .
if you could give a proper task to play player , they would just keep playing .
and finally , it &apos;s epic .
the game player likes to carry on in the <unk> of a human story .
any small amount of routine you &apos;ve ever done , you &apos;ve heard about Wikipedia , the biggest <unk> of all around the world .
the second largest bank in the world , &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; has about eight million hits .
every month , 500 million people are using it .
there &apos;s more information about World of Warcraft than any other theme on the Internet .
and this creates a epic story .
and it was also a story about &quot; World of Warcraft . &quot;
and this is the example of bringing those four superpowers to an event where the players are the ones that are highly licensed and hopeful .
they all felt that they were capable of changing the world , that they were capable of changing the world .
but the problem is that they believe they can change the world , not the real world .
and that &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to solve .
one economist , <unk> <unk> .
his job was pretty extraordinary . he studied why people spend so much time and energy and money online play .
and he said , &quot; We &apos;re seeing lots of people who live in virtual worlds and online gaming . &quot;
because he was an economist , he was rational .
and he said ...
unlike me , I &apos;m a game designer , and I &apos;m alive .
and he also said that games make sense , because games have more in the virtual world than in real life .
they can have better social relations in the video game , and they can get much better outcomes than real life .
so he said that for the game players , spend more time in the virtual world than in real time .
now I still think that &apos;s rational .
but anyway , that &apos;s not the best option .
we have to start building real world @-@ reality , like a game .
so I got inspiration from something that happened 2,500 years ago .
these are old <unk> , made out of bone <unk> .
before we had designed the game controller , we humans had the Christmas tree of a sheep joint .
this is the earliest game equipment ever devised .
if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient Greek historians , like the Greek historian , you will know what the history of the game invented and why .
the game is , in particular , the night sky game is invented by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
obviously , there was a terrible famine in history , and the king decided to do something crazy .
people were suffering and fighting each other .
they need an extreme solution .
according to the <unk> , they invented the dice , and they created a policy across the country , and one day , everybody could eat , but the next day , everybody would play a game .
people are playing dice because games are so appealing to us to live in such a self @-@ fulfilling situation , where people forget that they don &apos;t have food .
the next day , people were playing through games , and the next day they were going to eat .
and according to the old nations , the people in the form of <unk> have spent 18 years eating one day , playing games , and they have lived a great famine .
and that &apos;s how we look at games today .
we were <unk> through playing sports .
we use games to avoid the real world , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the things that we need .
and this process can be done forever .
this is very exciting .
the king , after 18 years , had no positive signs , no positive signs , so the king decided to play the last game in the country .
he divided the country on average , divided it into two groups .
together , one of the winners of the dice would be to take on a journey of adventure .
they &apos;re going to go out and find a new place to stay alive , and they &apos;re going to be able to live out of the existing resources , and they &apos;re going to be able to spread , the burden of <unk> , the <unk> of our civilization .
it sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but recently DNA evidence shows the ancestors of the Roman Empire -- the same thing as the <unk> .
recently , scientists have discovered crazy stories , historically , in history .
and geologists also looked for evidence that there were hundreds of millions of years of global cooling down , and that would explain this big famine .
so this seemingly crazy story is real .
they were able to survive their culture through the game , save their culture for 18 years and finally survive , and then they were able to figure out how to get people together through the game , and save the entire civilization .
we can do it that way .
people were playing World of Warcraft .
this is the first real @-@ time game in World of Warcraft , 16 years ago .
this is an 18 @-@ year @-@ old game , and we played the dice .
so I would argue that we &apos;re ready to accept a game that can change our lives .
this is the discovery of one half of our civilization , looking for the new world , and now we have six billion hours of play .
let &apos;s talk about half of us play games for an hour , and we can solve real @-@ life problems .
and you might ask , how do we solve the real problems in the game , <unk> -- that &apos;s why I &apos;ve spent the last couple of years focusing on what I &apos;ve been doing , what I call the <unk> Institute for the next few years ?
this is an ad that we put in our office in an office building , and it gives us a sense of how we think about the future .
we don &apos;t try to predict the future .
but we &apos;re going to create the future .
we had imagined the best possible results , and we wanted to see that by trying to get people to be real .
we crave the epic triumph , and we gave them the means of winning .
and I want to give you a quick overview of all the games that I do , some of the attempts , to try to give people the future , to create their own epic success , to give them something .
this is &quot; The <unk> World . &quot;
the game was made in 2007 .
this is a online game that gives you a chance to live without oil .
there &apos;s a waste shortage of oil , but we &apos;re going to spend a lot of the stuff that you think is real , and it &apos;s going to affect your real @-@ life situations in real life , so when you open up the game and tell us what &apos;s going to happen to you in real time , it &apos;s going to tell you what &apos;s going to happen to happen to happen .
in 2007 , there were 17 people on this game , and we tracked these people for the next three years .
and I can tell you that this is a very revolutionary experience .
no one wants to change their way of life , or because they think that &apos;s true for the environment , or that &apos;s reason .
but if you asked them to go into an amazing experience and tell them , we &apos;d run out of our oil .
it &apos;s going to be a wonderful story you &apos;ve ever heard of and extraordinary experiences .
challenge yourself , to see how do you live , most of the players in the game , keep the ones that they &apos;re used to in the game , keep the players from the ones that they &apos;re used to .
in the next game of saving the world , our choice is more difficult than the oil shortage .
we did a game called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which was a game called <unk> , and we made a game called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the premise of this game is that supercomputers live on the Earth for 23 years .
this supercomputer was called the World <unk> projection system .
people were playing in a game like Jerry <unk> .
you all know about <unk> <unk> , you organized a team of four members of your family who had astronauts and scientists and people who had a stake who had saved the world .
in the game that we designed , we didn &apos;t have the five team of five , and we designed them to be one of the four @-@ year @-@ olds , and your job is to develop the energy , the food , the safety systems , the safety networks of healthcare , the safety nets of society .
we had 8,000 people play this game , played with eight weeks .
they concluded 500 crazy , but creative solutions , if you could go online and go to Google <unk> , you could see results .
the last game we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to launch it in March , which is a game done with the World Bank .
if you can do this game , you will be able to get the <unk> of the World Bank and be the World Series .
by working with sub @-@ Saharan Africa , we &apos;re inviting them to participate in social innovation .
the game is more like a cartoon fiction . we have an equilibrium with skill , such as deep insight , knowledge , sustainability , etc .
and I invite you to actually share this game with young people everywhere , especially in the developing world , where you can get people to , to start thinking about their own social enterprises , to save the world .
I &apos;m going to finish my talk .
I want to ask a question .
what will happen in the future ?
we have so many good players , and we have these games that maybe we have trials that we &apos;re going to have in the future , but nothing has ever saved .
and I hope you will agree that my point is that the game players are a huge human resource , and we can get them to work in the real world , because of that , play is a real revolution .
we have all these wonderful superpowers , the ability of happiness , the ability of organized social structure , the ability of the mind , and the hope for the property .
and I would like to be honest with you , to be able to play with some of the great games of the next century .
and I want you to join us in making or supporting games like this .
and when I look forward to the next 10 years , I &apos;m pretty sure that first of all , we can create any future we can imagine , and second , we can play any game we want to play with .
let &apos;s start changing the world .
thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you a couple of months ago an article about a magazine called <unk> .
when I was writing , I was always putting the dictionary next to me , and I was able to get the article out , and I realized that I had never looked in the dictionary .
let me read this out for you .
twenty @-@ five <unk> of disabled , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , destruction , <unk> , injured , injured , injured , injured , injured , injured , injured , broken , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
conversely , it &apos;s robust , it &apos;s accessible .
and I read it to a friend who was listening to me at the time , and at first I was laughing so ridiculous that when the books were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , I looked up and I had to stop <unk> myself with these words .
yes , my old <unk> , my old <unk> , I think , must be very old .
but in fact , it was the norm that in the &apos; 80s , I was supposed to be able to take classes outside of my family and create a sense of myself and connect with the world .
thank God I had never had a dictionary .
what I mean by that is that , by <unk> the dictionary of the <unk> of disability , I can tell you that the world I live in today does not exist as my own disability , the world of the disabled , yet today , I &apos;m bringing them to my own adventure and opportunities for me .
so immediately , I looked online and looked at the <unk> of disability , in 2009 &apos;s version of the <unk> dictionary , and I expected to see some important changes .
and I &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a new version of disability .
unfortunately , the explanation wasn &apos;t much better than that .
the other word &quot; approaching &quot; is the opposite , &quot; and I &apos;m very uncomfortable with them : the full , the sound of the sound .
in fact , it &apos;s not just a few words .
when people use that negative vocabulary , they actually reflect the view of the disability .
what &apos;s remarkable about this is the value of the people who describe the vocabulary of the disabled , and the process of that value .
our language affects our mind and the way we see the world , the way we see it , the way we see it .
in fact , there are many ancient forms of ancient Greek and the ancient world that believe in the form of speech , because once it &apos;s said , it &apos;s true .
so , what do we really want to make something that &apos;s not capable or somebody that &apos;s capable ?
sometimes , we just give it to an adult or a child , but we can give them possibilities to question their own .
don &apos;t we want to open our hearts ?
I had this guy in my life , and he opened the door of my heart , and he was taking care of one of my doctors when I was a child , a doctor named <unk> <unk> <unk> at the <unk> Institute .
his name is <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s an Italian @-@ American woman who , obviously has a lot of his names , and it &apos;s very difficult for him to call him P .
and P physicians always carry on his own <unk> , and he was very well @-@ educated with his kids .
in addition to training courses , I spent a lot of time in his hospitals .
and I &apos;m going to do it through this thick , colorful , flexible tape that I &apos;ve been able to do over and over again and again with my legs , and I &apos;ve been able to remember the pieces of my leg , I &apos;ve even given them names .
I was a five @-@ year @-@ old boy , and I asked him to please stop me from letting me go . and of course , I didn &apos;t .
and one day , P &amp; amp ; quot ; So when I was doing my research , I was like , you know , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and he said to me , &quot; Amy , you &apos;re such a tough girl , you &apos;re such a tough girl , I feel you can break this tape .
when you broke it , I rewards you for 100 dollars .
obviously , this is a trick that P @-@ P @-@ A doctor , who just wanted me to do these things that I didn &apos;t love to do , and it turned out to be the richest people in the middle of the month , the most vulnerable patient in the middle of the month , but P , which I hate to translate into a whole new agenda .
today , I &apos;ve been thinking about how powerful my own dog , P &apos;s vision , and how powerful a strong young girl who has given me his own sense of self @-@ awareness , and today , I &apos;ve realized that my inner vision is <unk> , my future is bright .
this is an example by P , which illustrates the potential of a child with power .
but in the case of the <unk> dictionary , our language does not allow us to take what we want to see and turn it into reality and not allow the disabled to recognize that they are actually capable of being capable .
the technology is bringing social development , and our language has not evolved as we speak .
of course , from medicine &apos;s point of view , my fake leg , <unk> my vision , the X @-@ ray of the body , the hip replacement for the elderly , the kinds of technologies that allow people to combine and apply their ability to the natural world , and build them into the social networking platforms for our own people .
so technology is clearly showing us a permanent truth , and that is that every one of us is incredibly powerful , and that is the ability to contribute to society and to adapt to our environments .
it &apos;s interesting to talk about human adaptation , and I think it &apos;s interesting to talk about it , because when people want to get me out of adversity , I &apos;m afraid to do a little bit of it today , to get out of <unk> , to try to get people to come and talk about things that I &apos;m not particularly comfortable with , and that &apos;s why I start thinking about this .
and one of the things that came out of adversity is that there &apos;s a recipe for success , or pleasure at the other end of a difficult experience , and that experience itself has nothing to do with success and pleasure , and it &apos;s like , I &apos;ve been successful because I &apos;ve been around as a series of challenges that I &apos;ve seen as an amputation .
but in fact , these challenges really changed us , and on the course of our journey , we had this change that was possible in our bodies , possible in our bodies , and probably both .
what I want to say is , it &apos;s a good thing to face .
in the face of adversity , we shouldn &apos;t treat it as obstacles to continue our lives .
in fact , adversity is part of our lives .
I imagined adversity as my shadow .
sometimes it looks big , sometimes very small , but it &apos;s still around me .
of course , I &apos;m not trying to <unk> people &apos;s values and meaning out of <unk> .
we are destined to experience adversity and challenge all of us in our lives , but the problems we care about are not whether or not you want to go to the <unk> , but how to deal with it .
so our responsibility is not to simply simply simply to simply put ourselves in the fields of people we care about , but to make them <unk> out of adversity .
when we let our kids feel like we don &apos;t have a comfortable capacity , we actually hurts them .
the objective of medicine is to determine whether I &apos;m a disabled person , to think about whether I &apos;m a disabled person , is there a difference between those two things ?
in fact , one of the only problems that I had to deal with was the world &apos;s inability to describe and describe each other .
we want to be able to protect the people that we care about , that we &apos;re going to be able to take the hard physicians and diagnose them , or sometimes , to make predictions for their future lives , but we have to pay attention to whether or not we &apos;re going to destroy them .
perhaps , people are used to focus only on the flaws in their own body , and to think about how to repair these <unk> , which is more damaging to the lives of disabled individuals .
we don &apos;t see disabled people in a single way , and we don &apos;t recognize them , it &apos;s very difficult for them .
we can actually evaluate the value of a society based on its value .
so our eyes should not be limited to the <unk> of the disabled , but should be aware of their value as human beings .
in addition , the most important , the sum of the constraints of the disabled , between the human creativity .
so , the tough years of suffering are the ones that shouldn &apos;t be <unk> or <unk> , and that &apos;s not the case , we should be looking for opportunities in adversity .
in fact , what I would like to suggest is that adversity is not something that we should embrace , and we should embrace it and embrace it and I used it as a <unk> term .
maybe , if we can think of adversity as something natural and full @-@ stop and human beings , it can no longer afford us .
this year , we celebrated the 200 anniversary of Darwin , and when Darwin writes about the evolution of the species 150 years ago , he <unk> the truth of the human nature .
and the phrase that he said was probably that the species that survive on Earth are often not the strongest , not the smartest , but the outside environment .
conflict is the mother of creation .
Darwin and so many of you have seen this shift in the ability of human beings to survive , and that is the transformation of the human spirit .
and again , the greatest human ability , I think , is transformation and adapted .
maybe , before we get too far , we don &apos;t know what it is .
maybe this is the act of adversity , a sense of self and individual ability .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of adversity as an opportunity to change .
it wasn &apos;t a tough time .
adversity is a change , and we don &apos;t have time to cope with it .
and I think the biggest dilemma we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this notion of &quot; <unk> . &quot;
okay , what is it about <unk> ?
there &apos;s no justice at all .
I know what it is , what it is , what it is , what it is , what it is , I don &apos;t know what it is , what it is , if there &apos;s a poor , accessible person , <unk> , you &apos;re interested in them ?
I don &apos;t think so .
if we don &apos;t invest our energy into the <unk> , we invest in different possibilities , we see different possibilities , we invest in different kinds of abilities , take care of the potential of many children , and we &apos;re going to make them more valuable , they &apos;re going to be able to contribute to their communities .
anthropologists tell us that as humans , we always hope that the people in our community are useful , the ability to contribute .
the Neanderthals were , around 60,000 years ago , a pretty good evidence for their society , because they believed that old people were rich , that they were valuable .
older people never see themselves as useless , but they &apos;re considered as valuable .
one day , a few years ago , I was in a state of <unk> , Pennsylvania , a place where I was standing next to a <unk> tomato .
because it was the summer , I was wearing his shorts .
I came up with a man &apos;s voice in behind me , but isn &apos;t it Amy <unk> ?
and I turned around and realized that I had no idea .
and I said , &quot; Mr. <unk> , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve met ? I &apos;ve forgotten you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; Well , you don &apos;t remember the meeting we met . &quot;
because at the time , I was <unk> you out of your mother &apos;s uterus .
that &apos;s what I met .
and of course , at the end of the day I thought I was there .
this guy was a doctor , and I only knew that one man was telling me that I was a night old , two weeks later .
and at that time , my mother was given a vacation to take care of her doctor , and so she ended up being a doctor and a woman that I didn &apos;t know existed before .
when I was born , there were none of my <unk> , my feet , and neither one of them had to convey two bad things .
and he said to me , &quot; I told you that you would never walk , you would never walk like any other child , you would never live an individual life , ever since .
and one of the great things he did with my childhood was to pull out all of my childhood stories , including myself , when I was a sophomore at my second birthday , and I had all these stories in my medical school students , and I had them at school with my doctor &apos;s birthday party , and I had them come to school .
he called my story the X @-@ factor of the human mind , the infinite potential of the human mind .
there &apos;s no medical diagnostic to explain how powerful this will be , how powerful will it affect the quality of a human being ?
and Father <unk> said to me , even though there were many times other people <unk> my opinions , and according to my experience , even though there were fewer support for them , they were able to do it .
see , Tony &apos;s mind changed .
he realized that there was a difference between the medical diagnosis and the way one person treated it .
and a few years later , I had a certain shift , like , if you were 15 when I was 15 years old , if you were to ask me if I was going to use my current prosthetic arm , I would have said yes .
because I wanted to get that ticket .
but if you ask me the same question today , I &apos;m going to ask you .
and that &apos;s because of the experience I have with my prosthetic arm , I have a huge impact on it .
maybe , I &apos;ve got a deep inside of myself , because , in the people I met , people who opened my door to the new world , they &apos;re much more <unk> than I could put into my psyche .
see , what you need is a person who can show you the power of yourself .
the human soul is embracing , and if you can give somebody a key , give him the strength of the key to the key , and at the very moment , you can use the key to somebody else , and you can open the door in the best way to educate them .
because you &apos;re teaching them to open up the doors to the new world .
in fact , the <unk> of education , the meaning of the word &quot; <unk> &quot; comes from the word &quot; <unk> .
and that &apos;s where the light goes , is to discover the potential within it .
so , what are the potential for generating capability ?
there &apos;s a case in the 1960s where children from high school to high school .
in the U.K. , there &apos;s a guy called <unk> <unk> , and we call it the <unk> <unk> tracking .
the exam students divided the test scores from the top down to A , B , C , D.
there &apos;s a better teacher , etc .
and the three months of this experiment were told , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the time the students were told they were A , and they were told they were brilliant , three months at the end of the trial , and this is what the students were doing .
and of course , there &apos;s a flip side to this case , and that &apos;s that those who are supposed to be told that they &apos;re D @-@ C @-@ D students .
three months at the end of the trial .
many of them have dropped out .
one of the key points for this experiment was that teachers who were not aware of it .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that the students were killed .
the teachers were just told which A was a <unk> , and what was the James <unk> teacher ?
so , I think that true disability is a soul that has been beaten , a soul that has no hope for the future , a soul that can &apos;t feel a great soul , a soul that has lost our imagination , that has lost its imagination .
if we could make a human soul , we would love to see the soul and the beauty of the human spirit , and the imagination , and the imagination in a very good way .
as long as a soul continues to have those qualities , it creates an infinite possibility and a new lifestyle .
and I want to leave you with a poem by the end of the century , which is a poem by a friend of mine , Jacques <unk> , who told me his name is &quot; only a god of four words , &quot; each child knows that God has four words , not a word of God , but a word for them .
dancing with me . thank you .
I want to ask you now to imagine a <unk> robot that could give you a superhero , or a wheelchair where users could walk again .
we call this exoskeleton in Berkeley .
there &apos;s nothing else you can wear in the morning , and it &apos;s going to give you extra power , and it &apos;s going to give you the speed at which you are , like , control .
it actually <unk> people and machines .
but not only that -- it will combine and connect you with the outside world , connecting to other devices .
it &apos;s not just something that doesn &apos;t happen .
to show you what we &apos;re doing right now , we &apos;re going to talk about American soldiers , and they &apos;re about 100 pounds of weight on their back , and they &apos;re also asking for more equipment .
obviously , this leads to a number of violent problems -- 30 percent of the soldiers have injury on their back -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we should face this challenge and create an exoskeleton to help solve this problem .
so let me tell you a little bit about <unk> -- that &apos;s human loads .
soldiers : after I have <unk> exoskeletons , I can carry about 200 pounds of walking in complex terrain .
it &apos;s flexible design that allows people to go deep , down , down to high @-@ flexibility .
it can feel what I want to do , where I want to go , and then raise my strength and my strength .
Alan Kay : we &apos;re working with our partners and we &apos;re ready to introduce this new exoskeleton this year .
this is real .
now let &apos;s turn to the wheelchair itself , and that &apos;s a very personal part .
there are 240 million users in the world .
about one percent of the population .
this is a conservative estimate .
and what we &apos;re going to talk about now is that very young people with spinal cord injury are doing things -- 20 , 30 years old , 40 years old -- that touch a wheelchair is the only choice .
and this has enabled this number to grow .
and the only choice , roughly -- when someone has a stroke or something else -- is a wheelchair .
it &apos;s actually been shown recently that this is a very successful introduction , and I must say .
so I think we should start to write new stories about mobility .
now let me introduce you to the <unk> , which is Amanda <unk> , who had been damaged by the spines 19 years ago , so she couldn &apos;t walk until now .
Amanda <unk> : thank you .
<unk> : I said , &quot; Amanda wearing our <unk> . &quot;
it has sensors .
they send signals to the back of her back @-@ up computers .
and there &apos;s a battery pack , and there &apos;s a motor in her hip @-@ hop , including her <unk> motor , which allows her to go as a smooth step forward .
Amanda : I was the pinnacle of my life when I was 24 , when I fell asleep , and I was paralyzed .
and in that moment , I lost all the sense and the ability of the pelvis .
and very soon , a doctor walked into my ward and said to me , &quot; Amanda , you can &apos;t walk anymore . &quot;
that was 19 years ago .
he deprive me of hope .
I &apos;ve been able to learn how to ski again from technology , climb , climb up , even <unk> .
but nothing made me walk , until now .
thank you .
<unk> : as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down , which are already discussed .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential , to change our lives -- not just for the soldiers , but for the people that we have , but for everybody .
Amanda : thank you .
in New York , I am the head of the nonprofit sector .
I was also a senior in the middle of the herd of poverty , and I was also a hero of volunteer fire .
in our town , in a place where volunteers have been successful , you have to go very early to a place where you &apos;ve got to go .
I remember the first fire .
I was the second volunteer in the field , and I was probably going to be in the middle of nowhere .
but you also have to run and win and find other volunteers , first of all , to get the job distribution to you .
and when I was finally approached by the king , he was <unk> and <unk> , and she was obviously experiencing the worst of my life .
she stood in her pajamas and <unk> and <unk> , and her house was shaking .
another volunteer named him after my first step was called <unk> <unk> , and together , he was assigned to kill him , to save the dog .
<unk> ! I &apos;m jealous of death .
it &apos;s a lawyer or a <unk> for life to tell somebody that he &apos;s going to go deep and live a living dog , because he &apos;s better than me .
okay , here I am .
voice 3 : my past .
and he said , &quot; <unk> . I need you to get bored .
I need you upstairs , and I want you to take a break for this woman . &quot;
it &apos;s true . I swear .
this is not the image I have in my mind , but I went upstairs , and I walked up to the bottom , and I went through the <unk> , and they were literally blowing out of the fire , and I walked in and I got a pair of shoes .
I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m not a hero .
and I took my assignment and I went down to the front door , and I met the guy who had just met him earlier , Mr. <unk> and his dog .
and we went to the front door with our <unk> , and he was far more concerned than I &apos;d ever received .
a couple of weeks later , we received a letter from our family , and thank you for saving her family .
and she talked about this little , tiny little piece of detail , and somebody even gave birth to her .
whether I &apos;m working in &quot; <unk> , &quot; or me as a volunteer <unk> , I &apos;ve seen a lot of very generous <unk> , and I &apos;ve also seen how different the courage and compassion can be .
you know what I learned ?
they &apos;re all equally important .
and when I look around , people who are looking around , people who are beginning to succeed , they all have amazing outcomes , and I want to tell you , don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait for the first one to make a difference in someone else &apos;s life .
if you &apos;ve got something to give it to the present , it &apos;s time to pay .
whether it &apos;s food for the poor .
you have an example .
not every day , we have the opportunity to save lives , but every day we have a chance to affect the lives of others .
come on : save those shoes .
thank you .
Bruno : mark , Mark , come back .
thank you .
I &apos;d just come back from a community to master secrets of human survival .
in this community , women &apos;s dominant , have to have sex , have sex with each other , and play is a matter of every day -- play is serious .
no , it &apos;s not <unk> men , it &apos;s not San Francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your close relatives .
this is the wild world of the bonobos in Congo .
the bonobos are the most closely associated with the chimpanzees .
it means that we all share a common ancestor , a grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are dying for their females .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve been so <unk> about the evolution of human evolution .
but the bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
when the chimps are dominated by the bonobos , by the females , by the bonobos .
the bonobos do everything well for the bonobos , because the bonobos are detected .
but unfortunately , the bonobos are one of the most known species of <unk> by humans .
they live deep inside the jungles of Congo , so it &apos;s very difficult for them .
Congo is a landscape of <unk> -- she &apos;s a property of extraordinary biodiversity and beautiful land , but she &apos;s also dark -- violent images that have been taking place for decades that take place like World War I.
and it &apos;s not surprising that this damage was also a life of chimpanzees .
the business of meat and the bushes that mean that we can &apos;t provide a small habitat for the rest of the world &apos;s bonobos -- we can &apos;t even know if there &apos;s a small habitat .
and yet , on this land of violent and chaos , you can hear the <unk> dancing flames in the trees .
what are these close relatives ?
we know that they &apos;re <unk> , don &apos;t have war , so they have frequent , casual sex and sex with people to deal with conflict and social problems .
now I &apos;m not suggesting that this is a way to solve all of the problems that humans have -- because play is more than <unk> for a chimpanzee .
the bonobos are human , and the chimps love play throughout their lifetime .
play is not just a child &apos;s game .
for those of us who are right now , play is the foundation of intimacy and nurturing .
it also allows us to learn about trust and play .
it &apos;s a combination of creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about diversity -- the dynamics of diversity , the dynamics of diversity , the connectivity of diversity .
when you look at the <unk> of the bonobos , you see the source of very evolutionary roots , of dancing and rituals .
play is what makes us connect to each other .
now I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you two clips from just wild to special .
first of all , this is the <unk> game of the bonobos -- I don &apos;t mean football .
here , two young females are playing the game .
see what she &apos;s doing .
that &apos;s the phrase , &quot; She &apos;s playing with the birthplace of his music . &quot;
I just think he likes that way , right ?
yes .
so it &apos;s common for both humans and for humans .
and this video is really interesting because it suggests -- it &apos;s really interesting because it shows how you can take what is unusual , and you can take what is creative in a game -- like the <unk> -- how games can seek trust and nurture -- and at the same time , infinitely .
but play is a transformation process .
play is a <unk> process , and it can become a lot of play , some games are silent , imagination , imagination , imagination , <unk> -- perhaps magic of play .
and I want to show you , this is <unk> , a young woman who &apos;s playing water .
and I think , like her , we sometimes play on ourselves , we explore the boundaries of our hearts and our external world .
it &apos;s that play <unk> that drives us to explore , to engage us , to engage us , and then the unexpected connections that we &apos;ve created are real ingredients .
so these are just the ones that give us this deep insight into our past and now .
but they also have a secret to our future , and in the future we need to embrace an increasingly challenging world that has never been done before .
the secret is that play has all of these abilities .
in other words , play is the God who we use for the future .
we need play .
but are we going to play as hard as possible ?
play is not insignificant .
play is essential .
for those of you who are right now , life isn &apos;t just dogs and cats .
it &apos;s the most appropriate thing to play , but it &apos;s probably the most demanding of play .
well , my own primates , let us embrace the gift of evolution , the gift of play , and that we rediscover creativity , the relationship and wonder .
thank you .
and I want to ask you to imagine that six @-@ year @-@ olds were in the same day in 1979 , the same moment when every child gave birth to a child ...
so two and a half million people have moved to a child .
now , I don &apos;t want you all to spend your time thinking about being pregnant because if you spend too much time thinking about it , you &apos;re not going to hear me .
so think about it a little bit .
so in this case , I &apos;m going to take a look at the egg of the Y chromosome with the Y chromosome .
the other one is sperm that carry the X chromosome with the X chromosome .
both survive , and both of them started to grow .
let &apos;s take a look at this .
I became one of the two characters in my field .
one of the roles was my anatomy .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and what I study is how humans deal with anatomy -- either human body or animal bodies -- how they deal with body fluids , abstract bodies , how they look at bodies .
another role , as an activist , as a role for the patient -- or , as I say , as a physician , as a doctor , as a doctor -- I &apos;m pretty radical .
and what happened to me in my work was some of the challenges .
for example , some of the people I met were the <unk> who shared one body .
and then there &apos;s a couple of other patients , and they &apos;re much more effective than the average person .
in addition , many of the people that I met , their gender @-@ specific -- they didn &apos;t have a standard male feature or a female signature .
in general , the symptoms can be called <unk> .
there are many different forms .
let me give you a couple of examples where you can both be non @-@ standard male features , not the standard of female traits .
one example of one person can have four chromosomes , and the <unk> gene on the Y chromosome , we have the raw ingredients in the fetus that make it into the testicles .
so during the baby period , the testicles are hormone .
but this individual is missing the receptor , and the hormone has no response to the testes .
this is a disorder called <unk> .
so it &apos;s a lot of testosterone , but it can &apos;t cause it .
so the body moves toward a female trend .
when the baby was born , she looked like a girl .
she was the girl , and she was raised as a young girl .
most of the time , until puberty started , her chest wasn &apos;t growing , and we were starting to wonder what was going wrong .
so they looked at her , and they found that she didn &apos;t have <unk> and uterus , and she had hair in her body , and she carried the Y chromosome .
now , one of the big questions that I want to tell you is that this guy is actually not a boy .
women , like men , have an organ called <unk> .
it &apos;s on the back of our bodies .
and the hormone <unk> is responsible for a male hormone .
like most of my women -- and I believe that I am a typical woman -- I don &apos;t really know the composition of my chromosomes , but I think I should be a typical woman -- most of them are actually more sensitive than I am .
we release testosterone , we respond to it .
as a result , there were women like me , and the brain exposed more testosterone than she had when she was born .
so gender is a very complicated thing ; it &apos;s not about the men and women -- in some ways , they can cover the whole range of sexual function .
there was another couple of years ago when I received a call from a boy named <unk> , a boy who was born with a boy who had a girlfriend and a girlfriend who had sex with his girlfriend , but recently found himself having a life in her body .
all he had was a very extreme situation called steroids -- 21 <unk> disorder .
he carried <unk> chromosomes , and he was active in the womb to form a male hormone .
and as a result , he grew up males , and his brain got a lot more male testosterone .
so he was born , and he looked like a boy -- no doubt whatsoever .
and only when he got to age 19 , when he started to encounter a biological problem , it happened in the body , and the doctors discovered that the inside of him was actually female .
all right , let &apos;s take a quick look at another example of what could possibly be sexual .
some of the people on the chromosome will develop an organ called <unk> , which is one of the tissues that organized in the testes .
we don &apos;t know what it is .
so gender can be pretty hot .
the kids who have these physical traits -- whether it &apos;s an <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> -- are often diagnosed with a surgical procedure , not actually for their own health .
because in many cases , their bodies are healthy .
and the reason they were given all kinds of surgery was because they were under threat of our society .
or there &apos;s a typical body structure in society , what characteristics .
so the idea is that as a woman , you have to have the property of a woman , and so on and so on , a black person has to live in your body .
so we had this very simple recognition .
and when we &apos;re faced with something different , the ideas that we can &apos;t categorize , they &apos;re surprising .
so there &apos;s a lot of really great ideas about our culture , and it &apos;s about <unk> .
and our country is based on a very unusual concept of <unk> .
well , you can imagine how shocking that when two children were born in one body .
I recently met this situation where , at last year , Africa &apos;s track athletes , <unk> <unk> , were asked to question gender issues in the international competition .
and a lot of reporters called me and asked me , &quot; What kind of test would they use to prove to you <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
so I had to explain to them that there was no way to test .
in fact , we now know that gender is very complex , and we have to recognize that nature does not have a clear line between men and women , or men and women , and the lines that we draw ourselves .
so what we &apos;re seeing now is that the more the science is developing , the more we recognize these gender @-@ style forms , the more we take for granted , the physical structures , the more likely ones , are much more likely to give them than we think .
and it &apos;s not just about gender issues .
and it &apos;s also about racial issues , and this complexity is not something that our academics have described .
as we can see , we have all kinds of hard things .
let &apos;s take an example , and the reality is that we compare it with 95 percent of human DNA with gorilla .
and the fact is that humans and gorilla are just different creatures .
the more technologies we have , the more we have to deal with , the more difficult we have to admit , are simply too simplistic .
and for that reason , we &apos;re looking at a lot of human life .
one of the fields , for example , is that our culture , the culture of the United States today , lies upon its origins and its end .
we had a tough discussion about when we moved from one body to another , and we had a different kind of right to the baby .
we have a very controversial issue today -- maybe even beyond the internal debate in medicine -- about the question of when to consider death .
in the old days , our ancestors never sat down too much .
and most of all , just carry a feathers on their nose , and if the feathers moved , people wouldn &apos;t break them .
if feathers don &apos;t move , they disappear .
but what &apos;s happening today is that we want to transplant organs from people to other people .
and as a result of that challenge , we started to ask questions about whether or not we had died , which resulted in a very difficult situation , which had no simple breakdown .
now , you might think , well , all of these categories of things that are breaking down may be great for people like me .
I was a man who lived on a political note , and I had to admit that it really disturbed me .
and I realized that these categories were more unstable than we thought , and that made me nervous .
at the same time , my tensions came from democratic perspective .
so to tell you the extent of this tension , I want to admit that I &apos;m the biggest fan of all .
I know they &apos;re racist . they &apos;re <unk> , but they &apos;re great .
what I mean by that is , they &apos;re so heroic , fearless and engaged in their own business , and I will re @-@ enjoy the musical experience every few years .
it &apos;s because what happened around the world in <unk> .
the leaders , I think they &apos;re the earliest <unk> , and that &apos;s why I love them .
they were against a anatomical concept , and they were using a concept of another two @-@ year @-@ old concept , 200 years .
and when you think about our source , what we call an idea of <unk> , and that monarchy is based on the idea of simplicity .
the ones under the old regime had no DNA , but they were following the idea of &quot; birth . &quot;
they have a sense of aristocracy .
and they think that the people in politics , the people in politics , should be remembered as the <unk> , from the soul to the sons .
and the people who founded it were against it , and they were using it in a new way , and the idea was to do it .
they got rid of the hierarchy of ideas , and the idea of their anatomy , and it was really a radical innovation .
and in a way , it &apos;s still happening now , because they &apos;re part of the Enlightenment system , and two things are common .
democratic institutions were being formed at the time , but they were also technological .
what &apos;s really striking is , if you look at the history of the leaders , many of them are interested in science , and they &apos;re all interested in the world .
they <unk> the supernatural ideas about supernatural power , because the idea of supernatural power is transmitted by a very blurry notion .
they advocate for concept .
if you look at it , like in the Declaration of Independence , they talk about natural and natural God .
they didn &apos;t mention the nature of God and God .
they mentioned the power of nature to explain who we are .
and so as a result of that , they brought us an idea of equality .
and they did come up with a wonderful road to the future .
they had no idea what was going to happen , but they set us up , and that was great .
so what happened a few years later ?
for example , what happens to women in women , what they want to vote for , what they want to do , is they say , &quot; We have the uterus and the ovaries , which means that we don &apos;t have a free vote , we don &apos;t have private property rights , etc . &quot;
and the women said yes .
and the next thing that happened was that the Civil Rights Movement had come up with people like Joseph <unk> , who said , &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot;
we know that men have used to sign up for the civil rights movement route , &quot; I &apos;m a man . &quot;
in addition to that , the <unk> call to the <unk> and the <unk> .
we see the same success cases where people are <unk> .
the problem is , of course , when we started to look at all the citizens , we had to start questioning why we had a fixed line .
now , what I want to remind you is that I want to maintain some boundaries of the body , and within our culture .
for example , I don &apos;t want to give fish the same rights as humans .
I don &apos;t want us to give up the distinction between the anatomy .
I don &apos;t want to think that kids can get sexual activity , or they can get married .
so there are lines of anatomy , and there are meaning to us , I think , that should be kept .
but a huge challenge is to try and figure out why we should preserve them , what they mean .
so , let &apos;s go back to what we &apos;ve been talking about , and that &apos;s the first two of us that started out with this presentation .
we had six and a half million people pregnant at the same time in 1979 .
let &apos;s imagine , Mary was born three months earlier , so she was born on June 1 , 1980 .
Henry , on the contrary , his foot was born in January of 1980 .
it was only three months before Mary was born , and she had all kinds of rights over the course of three months before Henry , allowing the rights of sexual activity , the right to drink .
he had to wait for his physiology , not because he was born different .
we also found other incredible rights problems .
Henry , since I &apos;ve been assuming that for men -- although I haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s a <unk> genome -- because it &apos;s been hypothesized to be a man , Mary doesn &apos;t need to worry about this .
at the same time , Mary couldn &apos;t afford to enjoy all states , just as Henry , the right to marry .
Henry could get married in any state , but Mary is now married in a few states .
so the kinds of biological categories that we insisted on , the kinds of structures , they have problems and they need to question .
and to me , the question is : what do we want to do when our science is so advanced , we have to admit that the democracy on our anatomy may collapse ?
I don &apos;t want to lose hope for science , but at the same time , it &apos;s a little bit of science that &apos;s influenced by our impact .
so where do we go ?
it looks like our society has a utilitarian attitude : &quot; well , I have to draw a line somewhere , and I &apos;m just <unk> a line . &quot;
but a lot of people get a very embarrassing place .
for example , Texas has a decision to marry a man that says you don &apos;t have Y chromosomes , and if you marry a woman , you have Y chromosomes .
in reality , they don &apos;t actually test the chromosomes .
but this was also very strange , because I started telling you about the story of PMS .
we looked at one of the founders of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Luther King , in his &quot; I have a speech , &quot; gave us a solution .
he thought that we should not judge people &apos;s skin by a man , but by the way , by the way .
and I said , &quot; Yeah , that sounds like a good way . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do you judge him on his own ?
I also wanted to point out that I wasn &apos;t sure that we should distribute human rights , because I had to acknowledge that some of the gold <unk> seemed to be more useful than some of the people I knew were .
I also want to say that I know that some <unk> seem to be more <unk> than some of the 40 @-@ year @-@ olds , more <unk> , more mature decisions .
so how do we measure that ?
it turns out it &apos;s very difficult .
and I also wanted to know that if the right thing could be scanned in the future -- maybe be scanned by MRI ?
do we really want to get there ?
I &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what I know is that it &apos;s important to think about the problem of democracy in the United States .
we &apos;ve done a great job of trying to fight for democracy , and I think that &apos;s going to do it better .
we were different from Iran , like a man who was obsessed with other men , so that he could be killed unless he wanted to change his sexuality .
we didn &apos;t have that situation .
and I was pleased to say that we didn &apos;t have that situation -- to a surgeon , to a surgeon , who said that a few years ago , he wanted to be able to help them out , and to some extent make them famous .
but when I asked him why he wanted to do this surgery -- because it was a dangerous operation -- he said , in this country , kids like this will be cruel , so he has to help them .
and I said to him , &quot; Well , do you think about surgery for them instead of having surgery ? &quot;
the United States has made a huge contribution to kids like this , and they may not have to change their bodies in the world .
so I think we should be leading this idea .
well , by the way , I want to remind you that I &apos;ve talked a lot about what I &apos;ve been talking about .
I also wanted to think about what democracy would look like , or what it would look like if we could get more mothers to participate .
and I also want to say that a little bit radical about feminist is that I think different people might bring different perspectives , especially when we get used to thinking .
I &apos;ve been interested in sex for many years and years .
one of the things I &apos;m really interested in is to look at the differences between men and women in the world and the problem .
we know from a cultural study that we know that women , on average -- not everybody , but on average -- tend to be more interested in complex social relations , more concerned about the vulnerable of the population .
so if we think that way , we find an interesting situation .
a few years ago , when I read my graduate student , one of my <unk> @-@ <unk> knew that I was interested in -- I was a feminist , who was always -- he asked me a weird question .
and he said , &quot; Well , tell me where feminism is . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Well , this is the most important question I &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is the result of all the activities of the free @-@ gender , and therefore , feminism is not a shame .
but , to further understand this , I think , more likely , that feminism has some of the <unk> .
in other words , maybe there &apos;s a group of women who think differently than men , and it makes us much more robust to the complex social relations and more concerned about the vulnerable .
but the first thing that people have heard before is how to protect the individual from the state , and if we put it in this concept of <unk> , it &apos;s possible that we will have far more than one concept , more than just how to protect each other .
maybe that &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to go in the future , and when we take away from people , let &apos;s say democracy -- that &apos;s less likely to think about individual identity , but more about human identity .
so when people are trying to create a better , industrial force , what we need to think about is what we do for other people .
thank you .
I &apos;m Jesse , and this is my face .
but when I showed you what I had put in there , I had to do a very open , very openly , and that was , I was obsessed with clothing .
I was looking for them and wearing them , and recently , I was in love to photograph their pictures and their blog about them , and each of them has a different set of colorful , colorful clothes that are best for them .
but I didn &apos;t buy anything new .
my clothes were bought from <unk> and <unk> .
Oh , thank you .
shopping allows me to reduce the impact of clothing , and the impact of my wallet .
I could meet all kinds of funny people , and I could save money to charity ; I got dressed ; and also , shopping became my own private utility .
and I thought , what will I find today ?
would it be my size ?
would it be my favorite color ?
will it be under 20 dollars ?
if the answer is yes , I feel like I win .
I want to go back to my <unk> and tell you what I &apos;ve taken for a week at TED .
what is this guy with so many clothes ?
so I &apos;m going to show you what I took .
and I took the sheets of paper .
and that &apos;s exactly what happened to me on the week .
and I would bet I would find all the clothes that I needed .
since you see me right now , not the woman who &apos;s sitting next to TED -- it suggests that I actually found something new .
and now I really want to show you my week of clothing .
does it sound good ?
and of course , I &apos;m also going to talk to you about the life @-@ director , whether you believe it or not , these are the ideas that I &apos;ve been <unk> in &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so we started Sunday .
my name is &quot; Tiger . &quot;
you don &apos;t need to be <unk> with a lot of money .
it &apos;s almost like you can do it for less than 50 dollars .
this whole suit , this whole coat of clothing , was the most expensive clothing I could wear in my pocket .
Monday : color is powerful .
in biology , it &apos;s almost impossible to wear bright red pants on a bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other people to pleasure .
Tuesday : the stock got <unk> .
I spent a lot of time in my life trying to make myself , and also in mainstream .
you do it yourself .
if you have the right people around you , they will not only understand , they will enjoy it .
Wednesday : embracing your <unk> .
and sometimes people tell me that I &apos;m dressed , or I reminded them of their seven @-@ year @-@ olds .
I liked to smile and said , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
Thursday : confidence is key .
if you think you &apos;re wearing something looks good , you &apos;re going to wear pretty well .
if you don &apos;t think you &apos;re wearing something good , you &apos;re pretty sure .
growing up , my mom told me this every day .
but I was about 30 years old and knew what that meant .
and I &apos;ll give you a quick analysis .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person , <unk> , there &apos;s nothing you can wear .
so everyone in this room has no reason .
we can wear anything .
thank you .
Friday : a pervasive truth -- a few words for you : the gold standard .
and finally , Saturday . it &apos;s really a great way to tell the world who you are , who doesn &apos;t have to say .
it &apos;s time and again to prove to me that when people come to me this week , it &apos;s just because I wear something . we have a great conversation .
and of course , the clothes didn &apos;t break into my <unk> .
so before I got back to Brooklyn , I was going to pull everything out .
because this week I was teaching myself to let go .
I don &apos;t need to be worn out , because in the next corner , there will always be a crazy set of <unk> , <unk> in my <unk> , just as long as I carried my love to find .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon .
I have something to show you .
think of this as a pixel , a fly pixels .
we &apos;re in the lab , we call it <unk> .
let me introduce you to this .
now , if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian , every Italian boy has this photo on the wall , and they grow up , but I &apos;ll show you why some of the interesting things happened in the <unk> equation in the last few decades .
before , if you wanted to have a budget on <unk> , you just had to have a budget , and you took your budget and you bet on a good bet and a car .
if your car is good enough , then you &apos;re going to get it wrong .
now , if you want to look at this , in fact , you also need something else , like this -- some of which can detect the actual <unk> of a car that connects thousands of sensors to the vehicles that are collected , deliver them into the system , and then processing the feedback from the car to the actual processing information to the car .
so this is what engineers call real @-@ time surveillance systems .
basically , the system includes two components , one is a driver .
now , what &apos;s interesting about this is that this real @-@ time surveillance system is starting to sink into our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , have been covered by networks , by electronic industry .
it became like wireless and close @-@ up computers .
and also , as a wireless and closed computer , they begin to respond to different kinds of sensing and <unk> .
if we can optimize the city , it &apos;s actually a leap forward .
in my own mind , I would like to say that cities only occupy two percent of the Earth &apos;s surface , but they occupied 50 percent of the world population .
their energy consumption is 75 percent of the world -- 80 percent of the CO2 emissions .
so if we optimize the city , it would be a flying .
on these cities , all of these sensing and <unk> are entering into our daily lives .
this is an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
the theme is &quot; talking to me . &quot;
our environment , our environment , is beginning to give feedback .
in a sense , like every atom is turning into sensors and <unk> .
and that fundamentally changed our relationship to nature .
and in a way , this is the old dream .
you know , when Moses was like Moses , like Moses , at the end he got a <unk> , threw it into Moses , like -- in fact you see the little <unk> at the bottom -- saying , &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re talking to the <unk> , why ? &quot;
today , for the first time , our environment started giving us feedback .
and I &apos;m going to show you just a couple of examples -- one time , that we &apos;re going to perceive and respond to our environment .
let &apos;s start with sensing .
the first project I want to share with you is actually one of the first few projects in our lab .
that was in Italy six months ago .
what we were doing there was actually using a new network of networks that were already covered in the world -- cell phones , and through this network of information collecting detailed information about how cities work .
the summer was a very lucky summer -- 2006 .
this was the year the Italian World Cup <unk> .
some of you may remember , <unk> , the French race , which was a great deal .
anyway , Italy won .
now let &apos;s take a look at what happened that day in real time .
you see the city now .
you see the theater of Rome in the center , <unk> .
this is the morning , before the match .
you &apos;re looking at the top of the timeline .
and at noon , the people there were people walking around .
the game started -- silence .
<unk> <unk> . Italy was an <unk> .
and everybody quickly <unk> the phone , went to a toilet .
the game ended .
the first one , the second one .
when the wind broke , it was there .
Italy wins . ha .
at night , everybody went to the inner city celebration .
you can see rush hour .
the next day , everybody went to the inner city to the <unk> team and the prime minister .
and then the <unk> started coming back .
you see this place called the <unk> <unk> , where people started in Rome , and they celebrated -- there &apos;s a great party at the end of the day .
this is just one example of how we now perceive this city in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
another quick example of perception is not about people this time , but about things we use and consume .
today , we know where everything comes from .
this is a map showing you all the <unk> of a Mac and how to assemble .
but we have very few things to know where the ends are .
so this project , we actually developed some small tags to track the waste from the waste so that it &apos;s moving in the system .
in fact , we worked with volunteers who were willing to help us in Seattle , just a year ago , to get the things that people were throwing away -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that we just threw away anyway .
we took the little <unk> , the little tags , and we started tracking it on the garbage and we started tracking it .
this is what we see .
from Seattle ...
a week later .
and from that information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of effective operating in the system .
I actually do the same thing with less energy .
this data was not available .
but there &apos;s a lot of garbage and complex things happening .
there &apos;s another thing that we believe that if we want the cups we take away every day , it doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on Earth .
we &apos;d drop it every day .
if we showed this to people , then we could also advocate for changing behaviors .
so that &apos;s what this project meant .
I &apos;m at MIT , and Peter <unk> , who will tell you more about perception and lots of wonderful things that we can do with perception , but I want to start with the second section , which is actually about our environment .
the first project was done a couple of years ago in Spain .
it started with a question that was asked by the mayor , and he found us that the southern part of Europe , in a building , in a public water field .
the question is : how can technology , new technologies , make it cool ?
one of the ideas came from an R &amp; amp ; D group at MIT was about , you know , imagine a pipe , you have a valves , you have a <unk> , it doesn &apos;t work , it turns off .
you create a <unk> with the pixels of the water .
if the pixels leave , you can create these pixels , you can show the <unk> , the images , the text .
and when you approach it , it even shut you off , like you see here .
we showed this to the mayor of <unk> .
he liked it .
and then we got permission to build a building .
we call it the digital <unk> .
the whole building is made from water .
there are no doors or windows , but when you walk into it , it automatically makes you go to the corner .
the roof is also covered with water .
if there &apos;s a little bit of wind , if you want a little bit of water , you can actually put some roof down .
or even close the building , the building disappears , and it looks like this .
and these days , you &apos;ll see it in the winter days , and when they lower the roof , they &apos;ll say , &quot; They &apos;re <unk> the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t , just when it dropped , the building was almost completely gone .
this is what water does .
you can see how people get into trouble .
this is the sensor that I &apos;m trying to stop myself from testing the sensor .
I should tell you something happened at night when all the sensors stopped working .
but it made it even more interesting .
and all the kids on the building are going to get a little bit different .
the building will not open up and let you enter , but the building will still be divided into different spaces , so you wouldn &apos;t have to go to bed again .
and it &apos;s also interesting for us , because , as an architect , as an engineer , as an engineer , as a designer , we often think about how people use what we design .
but it &apos;s always unexpected .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing this .
this is a physical pixel , made out of water , and then made a projection on it .
and it reminds me of the next project I want to show you .
this is , imagine these pixels fly .
imagine that you would have a small helicopter that would move in the air , and each of them has a little pixels that can change color -- almost like a cloud that can move through the air .
watch a video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one we just saw , and a couple of helicopters , synchronize , moving .
so you get this cloud .
you get a flat screen , or you can show it , like this one -- two @-@ dimensional configuration .
or the usual , but the three @-@ dimensional changes are the drama , not the pixels .
you can use different methods .
imagine your display with a different scale or a scale , with various <unk> resolution .
but everything is just a three @-@ dimensional pixel cloud , and you can zoom in and look at it and see it from multiple perspectives .
this is the reduction of grid @-@ like grid .
when you turn on the lights , you can actually see this as it was before .
imagine if every one of those were controlled by one of them .
you can get input from every pixel , from the person , from person to person , from person to person .
I &apos;ll show you some of the first ones .
we &apos;re working with <unk> <unk> <unk> , one of the top <unk> of New York -- the New York Museum and <unk> -- to capture his 3D movements in real time .
you can see the <unk> dancing .
you can see it on the left , on the left .
this is all in real time 3D scanning and motion capture .
so you can reproduce the whole movement .
you can jump up like this .
but once you have these pixels , you can steer them with color and motion .
we wanted to use this as a kind of input @-@ output side of a fire .
I want to show you the last project we &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s something we did for the Olympics in London .
it &apos;s called the digital cloud .
and the idea came , again and again , as you can imagine , we can get people involved in doing things to change the environment -- namely , to sponsor our digital cloud built -- just like Lego , but the digital cloud .
think about the amount of money you can give everyone a pixel .
I think what has happened in the last few years is remarkable , in the last few decades , we &apos;ve gone through the physical world to digital .
now , computers , knowledge , are everywhere in the Internet .
today , for the first time , the Obama campaign told us -- we can go from digital self @-@ organized networks to physical world .
and this is feasible , in our case , to create a logo .
it would mean building some buildings in cities .
but in the future , it can be the challenges that are approaching today -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we go from digital to the physical world .
so we can actually get people involved in this .
this is the cloud , and , using the pixel formation , the way clouds form in the cloud form of particles .
the particles are water , and the numbers are the clouds of the pixel .
this is from London .
you can walk in and experience different experiences .
you can actually see at the bottom , the critical moment in 2012 , and really using it as a bridge to connect socially .
and the clouds in the sky are at the top where you can get to , like the new top of London .
you can come in .
it &apos;s a new digital <unk> at night -- but most importantly , it &apos;s created an experience where anyone can get to a peak .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is important to me .
through my artwork , I try to demonstrate that humans are not separate from nature , but everything is interconnected .
about 10 years ago , I went to Antarctica , and I first saw the iceberg .
I felt awe .
my heart is quick and quick , and try to understand what this is in front of me .
and I came to the waters of the iceberg , almost 200 feet away , and it was strange that a snowflake was covered in another patch , year after year .
the iceberg formed when they broke off the ice sheets , or breaking off the ice shelves .
each iceberg has its own unique personalities .
they interact with the environment around them in a slightly different way .
some of the iceberg refused to stick , and some of the iceberg couldn &apos;t survive without any tension whatsoever .
when you look at the iceberg , it &apos;s easy to think that they &apos;re alone , they &apos;re separate , they &apos;re separate , they &apos;re separate , they &apos;re more like us , sometimes .
but the reality is much more than that .
and as the iceberg melts , I breath out of its ancient odor .
and as the iceberg melted , it released the minerals of the rich minerals that fed everything .
and I started photographing these whale bones , and I was photographing my ancestors , and I realized that there was no way that it would ever exist in these individual islands .
when they melt , it &apos;s not death ; it &apos;s not an end ; it &apos;s an <unk> path to death .
I photographed the iceberg , some of which were very young -- thousands of years .
some ice has over 100,000 years .
the last image I want to show you is a iceberg in Greenland .
it &apos;s a very rare opportunity for us to actually see a iceberg as well .
so here you are .
on the left you see a boat .
this is a boat about 15 feet .
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg , the shape of it on the surface .
and here you see it starting with a boat , a boat moving along the other side , a man stands there .
this is an average of Greenland .
it came to the water , it was about 120 feet tall or 40 meters tall .
this is actual shot .
like this iceberg , they &apos;re showing you different aspects of their personality .
thank you .
I had the pleasure to participate in a variety of amazing projects .
but the really cool stuff about this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the original graffiti artists in the 1980s .
and one day he ran back to his house and he said , &quot; Dad , my legs were kind of <unk> . &quot;
this was the early onset of tens of patients .
he was completely paralyzed .
only his eyes would work .
I was with him .
I had a company that was designing and animation , and apparently graffiti was a complex part of the art world .
so we decided to become Tony , to sponsor our cause .
so I went to find his brother and his father and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you some money .
what would you do ? &quot;
his brother said , &quot; I just want to talk to Tony .
I just want to communicate with him and he can communicate with me . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Wait a minute , I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking , &quot; not all anyone who was paralyzed could communicate with these devices ?
and he said , &quot; No , unless it &apos;s someone who &apos;s in charge , &quot; with an incredible amount of money , or not .
it &apos;s not that easy . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK , how do you communicate ? &quot;
have you ever seen the movie &quot; <unk> and butterfly ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- moves their fingers .
and I said , &quot; It &apos;s too late . how ? &quot;
the wish that I came up was to just open up the check , and instead , I had a check that I had no idea how to break .
and I promised his brother and his father -- &quot; OK , we &apos;ll give him a machine , we &apos;ll figure out a way to do it again .
because one person is still sane and can &apos;t communicate , it &apos;s ridiculous . &quot;
a few months later , I had a speech at a conference .
I met these guys called <unk> , the graffiti lab , and they had a technology that allowed them to take a flash of light and paint it on any surface , and then paint it with a laser surface that would form a dark gap .
and they walk around and show art like this .
all of these things , they call it a life cycle .
first of all , pop @-@ up , then an <unk> , and then an <unk> Bush , and people saw art .
but they always showed meaning a life @-@ cycle .
and I went back home , and I had dinner with my wife for dinner with my wife , and I told her , &quot; Yes , if we knew that this technology would allow you to control things with your eyes , why don &apos;t we take a laser , this is what he could do again . &quot;
so we started acting .
about two years later , a year later , through many organizations and many of us changed something .
first of all , we had the door of the insurance companies , and we really gave him a machine to communicate -- a Stephen Hawking &apos;s machine .
that &apos;s great .
he &apos;s the most fun person -- I call him a <unk> , because you &apos;re speaking to him , and he gives you the impression , &quot; I &apos;m not . this guy &apos;s fine . &quot;
the other thing we did was , we gathered together programmers from all over the world -- literally , every corner of the world -- bringing them to us .
my wife and I moved to the garage behind , the hackers , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> .
many of our friends thought that we were so stupid that when we put our house back on the wall , the images were taken , and the walls were covered .
but after two weeks of doing that , two weeks later , we went to Venice Street , and my child was involved , and my dog was involved , and we made this .
we call it the eye <unk> . you can look at this .
this is the cheap sunglasses , and we buy it on a <unk> path to Venice , some <unk> and some lessons from <unk> and Radio to <unk> .
we took a <unk> camera , we dismantle it , put it in an LED , and now this device is free -- you can make it , you can download it for free .
now we can do it completely without limits .
no insurance would say , &quot; No . &quot;
no hospital can say &quot; No . &quot;
anyone who &apos;s paralyzed can now use their eyes to paint and communicate with .
thank you .
thank you very much . that &apos;s great .
at the end of two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
I love this photo because this is somebody else &apos;s room .
all of these congestion are meant for this momentous occasion .
over a year &apos;s program , two weeks of programming , fast food and night conferences , Tony started drawing in seven years .
this is an amazing image , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking at his life support system .
we had his bed so he could see it .
we formed a projector , and we put a wall out of his hospital .
he started painting , in front of his family and friends -- you could imagine what it felt like in a parking lot .
and the interesting thing is , we also wanted to break into the parking lot , and we felt like we were part of the whole thing .
and at the end of this session , he sent us over a series of letters , and it said , &quot; This is the first time I ever painted seven years .
I felt like I &apos;d been underwater , and I finally had a hand to put my water in the water , so I could breathe . &quot;
that &apos;s great , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s kind of like our battle slogan .
that &apos;s what keeps us moving .
we walked so far that we could .
it &apos;s a great device , but it &apos;s different from the drawings .
one has more artistic potential .
we &apos;re still exploring the process of exploring how to make it better , faster , more powerful .
and since then , we have all kinds of acceptance .
we won a lot of rewards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; no one in us makes money .
all of our spending is on us .
and we said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s great . &quot;
Armstrong had invented our Twitter , and then in December , the magazine gave us one of the top 50 inventions in 2010 , which is really cool .
and the cool thing is -- this is going to complete the whole loop -- April this year , at the San <unk> Gallery in downtown L.A. , there will be a &quot; street lamp . &quot;
and the street art will have a lot of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all of these people will come .
and this will happen in the <unk> , which is great .
so basically my point is , if you see something that &apos;s not impossible , make it possible .
everything that happened in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this <unk> , this eye -- it was impossible .
this is every single person in this room making it possible .
I &apos;m not a programmer , I hadn &apos;t done anything with the eye movement to recognize technology , but I was just thinking about something and linking myself to some amazing people that we can do something about .
and I just wanted everybody to do it every day , and when you think about something you should do , you should ask yourself questions . if I don &apos;t do it now , when I don &apos;t do it , who would do it ?
thank you .
as you know , my job is to write children &apos;s books , and I &apos;m probably the most widely read of American children .
I always tell people that I don &apos;t want to be a scientist .
you can think of me as a farmer , or a guy in a <unk> , but nobody was there .
I want to tell you today about recycling and connections .
and the epiphany is usually about showing you that you get into certain circumstances .
you have to go around and find an epiphany .
this is a loop image .
a friend of mine drew -- Richard Wurman .
it &apos;s complex . I &apos;m going to tell you about that .
my cycle started in the 1960s with a <unk> high school as a child .
I was one of those people who beat me up every week until a teacher got me out of this life .
she pulled me out of this life and put me in the bathroom in my teacher &apos;s room .
and she did .
she did it for three years .
but I had to leave the town .
with expertise , and I had 85 dollars , and eventually I had <unk> , California -- and I met my partner -- thinking back in the &apos; 80s , and &apos; 80s , and I noticed that the work was necessary .
about three or four years ago , I got a call from the teacher at night , and she said , &quot; I need to see you .
I was disappointed ; we never knew each other as adults .
can you please come and find someone you &apos;ve been looking for ?
I should mention that I have cancer , but I would like to invite you to ignore that .
so the next day we went to Cleveland .
we met her , we talked , we watched , and we knew that she needed to live in an old patient .
we found one for her , took her back and took care of her family , because it was necessary .
some things we need to know how to do .
that &apos;s the way I looked at my adult mind as an adult , and I ended up putting the powder in my hands .
and what happened was that , at the end of the cycle , it formed a loop -- the epiphany of what I said was self @-@ expression .
and that epiphany is a piece of life .
she saved my life , and I saved her life .
and that was the day of life .
it needs real and pleasure , and I &apos;m glad that many times today has been mentioned .
it also needs -- it requires dignity , love and joy , and the work of our work is to take these kinds of walking around .
thank you .
the idea behind the computer worms is fairly straightforward .
we don &apos;t want Iran to have nuclear weapons .
they were used to develop nuclear weapons @-@ based facilities , which were highly centralized <unk> facilities .
the <unk> boxes you see are real @-@ time control .
if we were to try to hack into these speed @-@ controlled systems , we could actually do a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
this <unk> box can &apos;t run Windows ; they &apos;re using completely different technologies .
but if we were to manage to take a Windows virus and put it in an engineer &apos;s box and put it on a laptop , then we could start to do it .
that &apos;s a conspiracy behind the virus .
so I started with a Windows <unk> .
it carried the virus up to the <unk> box , the centrifuge , the <unk> programs -- the task was done .
it &apos;s easy , right ?
and I want to tell you how we found this .
when we started working on the virus about six months ago , we knew nothing about it .
the only thing that you know is that its Windows portion is complex , and it uses multiple <unk> attacks .
it seemed to be able to do something about these <unk> boxes , these real @-@ time control systems .
and this caught our attention , and we started a lab project , and we had a virus virus that we had , and we ran a very careful examination .
and then something very interesting happened .
now , this is what happens when you don &apos;t like the <unk> of the virus -- smell , but not eat .
I don &apos;t understand .
and after we experimented with various different <unk> , I realized that this was an active attack .
it &apos;s totally <unk> .
if you find a specific configuration , you &apos;re going to dive into a <unk> box , even if it &apos;s trying to get infected , it &apos;s doing the same thing .
if there &apos;s no target , nothing can do .
and this really caught my attention , and we started working on this day and night , because I don &apos;t think we know it yet .
the goal might be , for example , a chemical factory in the United States , or in Germany .
so we &apos;d better figure out the goal as quickly as possible .
we took and we <unk> the code , and we realized that it had two digital bombs -- a smaller and bigger one .
and we also found that they were highly skilled at being able to understand all of the people who knew the information .
they know all the details about the attack .
they even knew the number of shoes .
they know everything .
if you &apos;ve ever heard of it , the complexity of the virus , the complexity of the virus , let me tell you , it &apos;s very complex .
it &apos;s more than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
and here you see the footage of the actual attack .
we &apos;re talking about -- it &apos;s about 15,000 books .
it looked very old .
I want to tell you how we can figure out the code .
the first thing we have to look for is the system <unk> , because we know what these functions are .
and then we had to find <unk> and <unk> , and then try to connect them to the real world -- linked to potential reality .
so we need to think , well , we need to figure out what to do with it .
and in order to get ideas , we remember that this would have been an absolute damaging destruction , so there must be a high @-@ value target , and there could be a risk of infection in Iran , because of the report of Iran .
there &apos;s not a lot of goals going on in this area .
you can basically narrow the target down to <unk> and <unk> plants .
so I said to my assistant , &quot; Give me a list of all the <unk> and the power plants . &quot;
I had a telephone with them , with their expertise , and we found it in code and data .
it works pretty well .
we can connect this little number with the controller .
this is a channel inside of a centrifuge , and this is the black object that you see there .
if you were to control this speed , you could actually crack the pen and make it explode .
and we also saw the goal of the attack , which was to slow the things down -- obviously making them mad , they &apos;re not going to be able to figure out the problem very quickly .
the big numbers are -- and we have the opportunity to understand this in a very careful way .
so for example , the numbers are pretty compelling in these code ; they can &apos;t ignore it .
and I started looking at the science literature of how to build these kinds of scientific literature about <unk> , and finding that they &apos;re organized in something called a level , and then each layer contains a centrifuge .
it &apos;s a little better . it matches up .
even better match .
and in Iran , these centrifuge were divided into 15 so @-@ called <unk> .
guess what we found in the code ?
a close @-@ knit family structure .
so again , it &apos;s perfectly appropriate .
this gave us more confidence in what we did .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , it &apos;s not like this .
and these results involve a few weeks of hard work .
and we go all the way down to the beginning .
so in short , we &apos;ve identified these two goals at the same goals .
the small trees choose a floor , accelerate the speed of light , and then they slow down , and the big <unk> choose the six @-@ floor and controls the valve .
in general , we were very confident that we knew what the goal was .
it &apos;s the <unk> . it &apos;s the <unk> .
we don &apos;t worry about the other goals of being attacked by a virus .
some of the cool things that we saw -- actually , I was shocked by things .
and here &apos;s the <unk> box , and there &apos;s a centrifuge up there .
and the thing is , it <unk> the input from the sensor -- for example , the input from the pressure sensor and the vibration sensor -- and providing a legal code for the code that stays at the time of the attack , the actual input from the code .
in fact , the data from the input data is from pre @-@ viral virus .
and just like the <unk> footage of a film in Hollywood , the camera was even recorded in advance .
cool , right ?
it &apos;s going to be obviously not just the driver of the control room .
it &apos;s actually more dangerous , more predator @-@ like .
it &apos;s going to be around the digital security system .
we need digital security systems where the operator can &apos;t do enough .
for example , in the power plant , when it &apos;s massive , it &apos;s got to open up a millisecond .
obviously , the human operator couldn &apos;t do that .
so we need digital security systems here .
and when they &apos;re damaged , the real problems come out .
the power plant would explode .
the operator and the safety system doesn &apos;t notice .
it &apos;s terrifying .
but it gets worse .
what I &apos;m going to say is , it &apos;s important .
think about this . this attack is universal .
it doesn &apos;t have to do specific things to uranium in a centrifuge .
it also works , for example , in a power plant or a car <unk> .
it &apos;s common .
as an attacker , you don &apos;t need to -- you don &apos;t have to send the virus out , as we see in the case of the <unk> virus .
you can also be transmitted by conventional worms .
it &apos;s as widespread as possible .
and if you do that , then eventually you have a network of weapons of mass destruction .
that &apos;s what we have to deal with .
unfortunately , the biggest goal of these attacks is not in the Middle East .
it &apos;s in the United States , Europe and Japan .
all these green areas , these are the areas that target density .
we have to deal with those consequences , and we better start to get ready .
thank you .
I have a question .
Ralph <unk> , who believed that the mind was a <unk> .
what do you see ?
Ralph <unk> : okay , you really want to know ?
yes , OK .
I think it &apos;s not Israel .
the back of the Internet was the networked .
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s America -- luckily , very lucky .
because otherwise , we were faced with more severe .
thank you very much for letting us smile , thank you , Ralph .
in the last few years , I &apos;ve asked myself to be both tough and dangerous .
I went to prison -- tough .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
I was photographing in the war -- tough and dangerous .
I had spent 30 days eating this food -- which was interesting in the middle , and in the middle , it was tough , and at the end , it was pretty dangerous .
in fact , for most of my career , I &apos;ve spent the most part of my career trying to get myself involved in situations where I &apos;ve been particularly drawn to people , more interestingly , to study social problems in front of an audience .
so when I realized I was going to come here and do a TEDTalk about brands and funding , I realized that I wanted to do a lot of money .
some of you may have heard about that a couple of weeks ago , and I ran an ad in an ad campaign .
there &apos;s a little bit of information about Facebook and Twitter that I &apos;ve given people the opportunity to buy my TED Talk in 2011 .
yes , some lucky person or company would have the only opportunity in life , because I &apos;m sure Chris Anderson won &apos;t allow this to happen , the second time -- to buy this presentation that you &apos;re looking at , there &apos;s not a sign , there &apos;s not a lot of advice , and there &apos;s nothing for that .
so what you get is : your <unk> are here : you don &apos;t know anything about my TED Talk , and it determines whether or not I &apos;m going to blow it up , and if I give you shame the company , that &apos;s the big possibility .
but then again , this is a fantastic opportunity for ad hoc .
do you know how many people are watching TED ?
there &apos;s more people .
by the way , this is the headline of the speech .
and in doing that , I believe some people will buy it .
if you were to ask me a year ago , I wouldn &apos;t be as good as this .
but the new project that I was working on , which is my new film , is that we have to deal with marketing , and we have to do something about it .
as I said earlier this years , I &apos;ve been keeping myself in a situation where I &apos;ve been in a situation where I &apos;ve been , but I &apos;ve been most vulnerable to my practice , and I &apos;ve been most vulnerable to my own experience .
you see , I have a film like this .
Morgan <unk> : I wanted to take a film about advertising , put it in , marketing , marketing , and an ad campaign , and this was funded by ads , marketing , marketing , campaign .
and the title of this film is going to be &quot; The <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; top @-@ down film &quot; has <unk> all over the world , and it &apos;s filled with brand from top to bottom , which is brand .
the brand , the <unk> Center ...
the lives of these people combine the film with this film -- forever .
and the movie was this idea -- Michael <unk> : what is it ?
I always say it again .
that &apos;s to emphasize .
it &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but not only do we sell each other &apos;s brand , but we also sell every product in the video of the brand .
so , we sell one pair of shoes , and we become the most <unk> of all time .
the most <unk> of all time in the history of film , the car in which the best car ever had , the most dominant <unk> of all time , made the film &quot; film ever . &quot;
<unk> <unk> : so what that means is , not just show that brand is a part of people &apos;s lives , but it &apos;s raising this brand .
<unk> : in fact , we will show the process of marketing .
the point of this film is transparency .
in the video , you &apos;re going to see the process of the brand marketing .
this was the whole movie . this was the whole movie .
I wish <unk> could help .
Robert Friedman : it was funny when I first heard this , I think it was the most profound honor for the audience .
but I don &apos;t know if people can .
Edith Widder : have you ever predicted -- I don &apos;t want to take that word , because it has a negative color -- what do you think the result of that ?
DR : how much would this film take ?
one and a half million times .
John Kamen : I think it &apos;s going to be very difficult to deal with these brand , but it &apos;s worth looking for these big brands .
<unk> <unk> : who knows , your movie came out , and we were probably a bunch of stupid <unk> .
<unk> : what do you think they &apos;re going to do ?
Stewart Brand : most of them refused .
<unk> : and the reason they refused was because I myself ?
John Kamen : all of them .
<unk> : <unk> .
sir , can you help me ? I need help .
Michael <unk> : I can help you .
FG : great .
that &apos;s great .
Michael Sandel : we must lock the brand .
FG : exactly .
you &apos;re going to work with those people .
Michael <unk> : we have some people in the chain .
turn off the camera .
FG : I thought , &quot; Let &apos;s turn the camera off , &quot; and talk about it in private .
as a result , it meant , &quot; We don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your film . &quot;
<unk> : so there it is , these companies have gone .
none of them wanted to help this film .
and I was shocked .
they were not interested in this .
and I was shocked by thinking that the idea of advertising , the idea of advertising , was essentially to put your product in front of as many people as possible to see your product .
and in particular in the world today &apos;s media , shouldn &apos;t there be a new way of transporting information to the masses ?
no , that &apos;s just my personal idea .
the problem is , you see my idea , there &apos;s a lethal mistake here .
in fact , it &apos;s not true .
that &apos;s not the problem .
this is acceptable .
but this graph represents the problem .
you see , if you Google &quot; <unk> &quot; -- that &apos;s one of the biggest pictures on the search .
I love your way . <unk> <unk> .
this is the problem : transparency -- transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , access to information , access to information , and access to business -- the last one is probably the biggest problem .
you see , recently we hear transparency .
our politicians , our president , even CEOs , are using this word .
and yet , at the end of the day , the situation changed .
why ? transparency is <unk> -- it &apos;s like this bear here , but it &apos;s also <unk> bears .
it &apos;s kind of strange -- like this strange act in the countryside .
it looked like an <unk> .
so what else ?
and you eat all this ice cream and ice cream .
it &apos;s pretty bleak .
when I started talking to companies and told them we wanted to tell a story , they said , &quot; Oh , we want to tell you a story .
we want you to tell stories , we just want you to tell our stories . &quot;
and when I was a child , my father sometimes realized that I was looking at him in the wrong way -- he was looking at me all the time -- he said , &quot; The son , every story has three stories .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , there &apos;s a real story . &quot;
you see , we want to tell the story in this movie .
and only one of the companies wanted to help me -- because I had a meeting with John Allen and Richard <unk> -- and I realized that just as far as I had to skip ahead , I had to skip ahead with my team directly with my team .
and you suddenly start to realize that -- or when I started to realize -- you started talking to these companies about your own brand .
Ryan <unk> : I &apos;ve got two friends of film in Hollywood , and I &apos;ve met friends like me who make small independent movies .
and the friends of my film , the friends of Hollywood , told me they were successful because of their brand .
and my friends who made small independent movies said , &quot; How can we make these Hollywood movies ? &quot;
and one of those movies is called &quot; The <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
so how are we going to see this brand in this film ?
and when I got out of the door , every time I open my kitchen cabinet , you would see <unk> .
and whenever I talk to someone , I say , &quot; You &apos;re going to have enough breath today ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
I &apos;ll help you relax .
maybe you can use some of it before you talk . &quot;
we &apos;re <unk> these strands of body fluids .
whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> , there &apos;s always one right for you .
we &apos;re also going to give men women these products -- solid , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> body fluids .
that &apos;s what happens .
now I &apos;m going to answer any of your questions for you to further understand .
Frank Gehry : we &apos;re a pretty good designer .
and as you &apos;re talking about the cost of a little movie , we &apos;re a brand .
we don &apos;t look like other big brands .
and to do that kind of campaign -- you know , it &apos;s going to cause people to pay attention to each other -- that &apos;s where we come from .
<unk> : what would you use to describe this brand ?
and how about that ?
Frank Gehry was a good idea .
woman : cutting @-@ edge .
<unk> <unk> : technology is not the best way to describe it , <unk> is the product of people moving in .
we talked about daring , <unk> .
and I want to say , &quot; <unk> &quot; is the positive flow of products , and the flow of light , and the need for comfort .
it gives you a sense of <unk> .
how do you <unk> your body -- it &apos;s much more clean .
these things can be positive .
that &apos;s a small number of businesses .
what about me ? what does a man think ?
I had to ask people on the street , and they were like me , and they were on the street .
they have to tell their brand .
<unk> : how would you describe your brand ?
my brand ?
I don &apos;t know .
I love very good dress .
in the 1980s , the <unk> , unless it is today .
FG : okay , Gary , what a brand ?
Gary : different .
I think it &apos;s my style that I think should be &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I love the dark gray things .
I usually wear a <unk> , like <unk> , and I like a <unk> .
if you had a brand , then it would be a classic shed , like the Mercedes <unk> .
two : my brand , I would call it &quot; <unk> @-@ <unk> . &quot;
woman 2 : a bit of hippie , a bit of yoga , a bit of <unk> -- I don &apos;t know .
I like to raise the pets .
my own national bank , even around the world .
and I think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand new brand in the <unk> industry .
four : my brand is FedEx . I &apos;m <unk> .
&#91; unclear &#93; <unk> <unk> writers .
is this a ?
lawyer : my brand is lawyers .
Tom : I am Tom .
<unk> <unk> : so we can &apos;t all be Tom &apos;s , but I find myself the result of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I realized that what I needed was an expert .
a person who could read what I thought was , who could really help me understand what brand means .
so I found a company in Pittsburgh called <unk> .
they &apos;ve helped <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , brand <unk> , to see their brand .
if they could help those brands , then they would certainly help me .
<unk> : have you taken pictures ?
FG : I took it . the first picture is my <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : tell me what it feels like to feel about yourself .
<unk> : these people helped me to create the way we see the world .
<unk> : what kind of a world ?
<unk> : the world ? I think your world is the world of your life -- all of your friends , your family , your lifestyle , your work .
all of this has been a single @-@ <unk> place , and that &apos;s where I &apos;m in West Virginia .
<unk> : what about the next picture ?
<unk> : next . this is my happiest day .
<unk> : what does this relate to your perception ?
FG : this is about who I want to be .
I love new things .
I like weird things .
<unk> <unk> : tell me , &quot; Why &quot; -- what does this help us ?
so what does that mean ? where do you come from ?
why is it so important ? what is the red ?
so let &apos;s take a look at this .
talk about what doesn &apos;t fit in your style .
what are you going to walk through ?
it &apos;s not necessarily fear . what kind of a roller coaster that you &apos;re sitting on ?
FG : Whoa !
<unk> <unk> : thank you for your patient .
<unk> : yeah .
I don &apos;t know what the end result is .
that &apos;s a lot of complex stuff .
Edith Widder : so the first letter of this brand is two separate pieces of your brand , but one on both sides -- Morgan <unk> -- is a brand , or a brand , or a brand .
these two are great <unk> .
it &apos;s almost like a <unk> .
and I think some companies often take advantage of their advantage and not both .
most companies tend to -- and this is true -- avoid the kinds of things they don &apos;t know , and you &apos;re the opposite of it -- and you actually turn it into <unk> , which is great .
so what does a brand like ?
the first is the classic , Apple .
and then there &apos;s also Target , the dome , and there &apos;s <unk> .
some brands are &quot; <unk> , &quot; and some brand has a depth of ideas , and those brand aren &apos;t very long , but a depth of ideas , a depth of ideas , a brand of power .
<unk> : a brand . what about your brand ?
what if somebody asked you to describe your brand , your brand personality ?
are you annoyed ? are you going to make people miserable ?
or is it a static brand ?
do you make your brand more robust , <unk> ?
it &apos;s more like a brand @-@ new style <unk> , a little bit like <unk> <unk> <unk> , an <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> , a magic and a secret .
or are you more unstable ?
you &apos;re like James Bond , you know ?
do you <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> like Oprah ?
have you ever believed in a stable , familiar , <unk> with ideas and wisdom , like the Dalai Lama or the <unk> ?
from this film , we found companies that were more than 1,000 or less low @-@ tech brands , and they said , &quot; No , they &apos;re not willing to have anything to do with the film .
they didn &apos;t want to relate to the film , because they didn &apos;t have control .
but we ended up with 17 companies who were willing to hand @-@ hand control and collaboration with people like me who had ideas and their power to tell stories , to tell stories about the things that we don &apos;t know -- the stories that the advertisers never have .
they asked us to tell stories about <unk> , and we introduced them in the movie , how they could use MRI to find areas of the brain that control desire , to go to marketing .
we were going to ban <unk> São Paulo .
there &apos;s no poster in the city for the last five years , no poster , no poster .
we went to school areas , where companies were trying to put ads in all the major schools in the United States .
what blew my mind was , I got the most feedback or gave me the biggest results that I could ever deal with .
what do they do ?
they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , thought , well , these <unk> may not take my benefits .
I &apos;m going to focus on artists .
and I &apos;m going to create a very special film with him , and it &apos;s going to make a difference in the world .
what does it do to people ? is it successful ?
it was on film <unk> , and we looked at it .
according to the data , film has been released from January -- it &apos;s not the whole movie -- we &apos;ve got about nine billion stories of the press on the movie .
the whole story would add up to two and a half weeks .
and this is just what happens on the Web -- not whether it &apos;s <unk> or TV .
the film was not even released .
there &apos;s not online .
it &apos;s not happening in other countries .
and it ended up having a lot of attention .
and for a movie like this , it was a great achievement test , and we wanted an ad agency to not get involved .
and I still believe that if you dare , if you dare , take risks , those risks become opportunities .
I believe that when you don &apos;t let people take risks , you &apos;re pushing them towards failure .
and I believe that when you educate your staff and you don &apos;t take risks , you &apos;re putting the benefits of the entire company in danger .
and I think that to make progress , we have to encourage people to take risks .
we have to encourage people to not be afraid of seemingly dangerous opportunities .
and finally , I think we have to face this fear .
we had to put that bear in the cage .
the fear of terror is upon us .
a bite of the risk .
eventually , we have to embrace transparency .
now , more than ever before , a little bit of faith can have a very strong life .
and I said , &quot; <unk> my whole talk through honesty through creativity and transparency , &quot; <unk> transparency , &quot; by my friends at <unk> , they gave a talk on <unk> .
<unk> : big data , big opportunities for global entrepreneurs .
they give you transparency .
thank you very much .
Jean @-@ Claude <unk> : so where did zero @-@ sum targets have been made for transparency ?
<unk> : that &apos;s a great question .
I have a check in my pocket that comes out of the TED <unk> Foundation , and that &apos;s a <unk> check for my next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I proposed this idea to my boss to do something about art and museum , and my boss was here today .
it took 18 months .
I &apos;ve been through a lot of fun negotiation and stories , and I can talk to you about nine countries , and I &apos;ve met 17 very interesting museums .
but I want to focus on this .
I can tell a lot of stories about why we should do this .
my personal story is very simple : how do you go in the slides ?
I grew up in India .
I got a great education , and I didn &apos;t want to complain about what , but I didn &apos;t have a lot of opportunities to see the museums and artwork .
so when I had the opportunity to travel around these museums , I learned a lot .
when I was working at Google , I was able to combine the technology and make it easier for people to come into the space .
so we formed a team , a wonderful team , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to go and show you some of the interesting stories that started this project .
so , very simple . you go to <unk>
you see all these museums .
you see the museum , you see the New York Museum of Modern Art , the museum , the Netherlands , the museum .
now let me get to one of my favorites , the New York Museum of Art .
there are two ways to go , very simple .
click , bang , you &apos;re in the museum .
wherever you are in Mumbai , Mexico , doesn &apos;t care .
you &apos;re walking around . you &apos;re enjoying it .
you want to follow a line in the museum .
you click on it . you pop it up .
you go in , you want to walk into the corridor .
go on and play .
explore .
thank you . I haven &apos;t talked about the best parts .
now I was faced with a painting of Peter <unk> , who was the one I loved .
I saw this plus .
if the museum gave us imagery , you click on it .
this is one of the images .
here &apos;s all the data .
if you &apos;re really interested in this artwork , you can click on it , but now I &apos;m going to lock it up .
this is an image we took , and this is what we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
for example , this is a map , close to 100 billion pixels .
a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you get from 100 billion pixels ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to show you what the 100 billion pixels are showing you .
you can contract it with a brief <unk> .
you see something interesting .
I love this guy . his face is valuable .
but you really want to go further .
so I looked around and I saw what happened here .
and I said , &quot; Wait a sec .
close to here , I started noticing what these kids are throwing .
and I studied it , and I talked to a couple of people in the museum , and it turns out that this was a game called <unk> , and it was a tough day with sticks .
it &apos;s pretty popular .
I don &apos;t know why they do that , but I learned that .
and now it gets deeper , and you can see the <unk> .
now let me show you a little bit of this vision , and I &apos;m going to zoom out , and you can see it all .
this is our site , and this is the painting .
best of all , wait .
now let &apos;s go to the Museum of Modern Art .
my other favorite : &quot; <unk> . &quot;
let me give you an example of the details .
so what if you wanted to look at <unk> ?
and if you want to see how <unk> actually created this masterpiece .
you zoom in . you really zoom in .
I couldn &apos;t see the favorite parts of my favorite , which I could really see .
this is &quot; <unk> , &quot; which I thought I &apos;d never seen .
I want to introduce you to another function that I like .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff . I don &apos;t have time to go through it .
this is one of the really cool parts , the collection .
any of you , no matter whether you &apos;re rich or poor , whether you have a gorgeous house , no matter if you &apos;re rich .
you can go in and create your own online museum in these pieces .
it &apos;s simple . you come in and you create this force called the <unk> , and you can see it everywhere .
this is the <unk> of the National Gallery .
you can write <unk> , and you can send your friends to really explore the sense of your work .
so I want to conclude by saying that for me , the most important thing is that these creatures are not from Google .
I personally thought that it wasn &apos;t a museum .
I &apos;m not supposed to say that .
it really came from these artists .
and that &apos;s the way I feel it .
I mean , I want this digital media to be able to show their artwork properly .
and the biggest question I &apos;ve got today is , &quot; Do you try to replicate it ? &quot;
my answer was no .
it &apos;s a replacement experience .
and I said , thank you .
thank you .
this is a diagram of the brain . your brain can split into two parts .
the left hemisphere , which is responsible for reason , the right brain , is largely responsible .
and if we measured the power of the brain , we could measure our brains by measuring it .
for example , it means that somebody is completely rational .
and that means that somebody is completely emotional .
so where do you put your brain online ?
some people might choose one of these extreme situations , but I think most of you in the audience should be more like this -- two brains simultaneously have a very high potential .
they &apos;re not likely to tolerate or anything .
you can be rational and emotional .
and I think that there are many other quantum physicists , like most of these experiments , have great ideas about how to relate to complex ideas .
but at the same time , we also need a good intuition to keep the experiments going .
so how do we raise that intuition ? well , we like to study things .
we study and mess with it , and then we look at how it responds , and then we lift our intuition .
you actually do the same thing .
some of the intuitions that you may have developed for many years is that there &apos;s only one thing that happens at the same time .
I mean , it &apos;s weird to think about a thing that can happen at the same time in two different places , but you &apos;re not born that way , you &apos;re born .
I remember seeing a child playing with a piano .
he was also a child that was not very good at this child , and he fell down .
but one of the great lessons that I bet and <unk> play has given him is that large objects don &apos;t allow you to go through , and they stay in a place .
this is a very conceptual model in the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
and this would also be a very bad model for particle physicists , because they didn &apos;t look at the <unk> , they looked at the little particles .
and when they looked at their particles , they thought they were doing all kinds of really strange things -- like they could penetrate the wall , or they could come in at the same time .
they were recording these findings , and they were calling quantum mechanics .
this is the cutting edge of physics a few years ago ; you need quantum mechanics to describe tiny , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around you .
and that doesn &apos;t really match my intuition , maybe because I don &apos;t look at the particles too often .
well , I still work on them sometimes , but it &apos;s not the same .
and I never saw them .
I mean , nobody can see the particles .
but that doesn &apos;t match my logic .
because if everything was made up of particles , and each of those particles followed the quantum theory of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t anything follow quantum theory ?
I couldn &apos;t find why it didn &apos;t follow .
so I know better about the whole thing , and if we look at it in a way that tells us everything is rooted in quantum mechanics .
not long ago , I started .
I built this .
this is the first thing you can see and the result of quantum mechanics .
here we see a computer chip .
in the middle , you can probably see the <unk> .
that &apos;s the metal I &apos;m going to talk about in the next couple .
this is a picture of it .
focus a little bit . we see that at the center .
and it &apos;s a very close @-@ up , very close @-@ up view .
what we see here is a little bit of metal , and it looks like a water tank , and it stretch out on one end .
and I made this metal with a computer chip .
I was working on a silicon chip , and I was <unk> all of these large machines for about 100 hours .
to the end result , I had to make my own machine -- at the bottom of the swimming pool .
this device has the ability to layer quantum layer , but it needs some help to do it .
let me give you an example .
do you know how uncomfortable it is in a crowded elevator ?
I mean , when I was a person in the elevator , I could do all kinds of weird things , but when other people came in , I stopped doing these things , because I didn &apos;t want to look at other people , or , frankly , scared people .
so quantum mechanics suggests that non @-@ organisms have changed the same situation .
the people who don &apos;t live in are not just people , but it also contains the heat of its light and its heat .
so if we want to see the properties of this piece of quantum mechanics , we have to wipe out all the other passengers .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
we turn off the lights , and we put it in a <unk> and we pull out all the air , and then we cool it down to above freezing .
now , in the elevator , the little <unk> can do anything she wants to do .
we measured it .
and we found it in a very peculiar way .
it &apos;s vibrating , not completely static . it &apos;s vibration @-@ like .
and just to give it a little bit of impact , we can make it vibrate and not vibration -- something that happens only in quantum mechanics .
I &apos;m here to tell you a couple of wonderful things .
what does a thing vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
one example : all of the atoms that make up are still static and they &apos;re moving up and down .
only at a certain time , they are consistent .
the rest of the time they &apos;re <unk> .
that means every atom is at the same time , and it &apos;s going to tell you a little bit about where the entire field is in two places .
and I think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
and I &apos;ve been able to lock myself up in all of these years because , if you look at this , the size of a single atom and a <unk> is about as bad as the mass of your individual .
so if the individual position is in two different positions at the same time , then the bow can be in different positions , why don &apos;t you ?
I mean , that &apos;s just my logic .
so think about what it would look like if you were in multiple positions at the same time .
how do you know that you &apos;re going to address the <unk> of your own space ?
this is a piece of the story .
when we heat it up and we open it up , and we see that the lights are still one piece .
so I had to create a new intuition , and it seemed that all the objects in the elevator were actually tucked in a tiny space .
you &apos;ve heard a lot about how quantum physics explains everything connected .
well , that &apos;s not exactly right .
it &apos;s more widespread than that , more profound .
and that &apos;s the connection , the links between you and the neighborhood around you , really define who you are , and that &apos;s the deep science of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , I felt we needed to reinvent the economic development of our consciousness .
our new goal should be to work in places where each family thinks about their work and their jobs , at least five different places where they can choose to be competitive to new cities .
we have a long way to go .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t have a city that will have them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that it &apos;s much more valuable than the cost of building .
so we can easily build hundreds of miles for the world , or hundreds of miles .
you may think that sounds ridiculous if you &apos;ve never considered a <unk> .
but this is just about replacing the urban building .
imagine half of the people who wanted to live in the apartment were already there ; half weren &apos;t there .
you can grow the size of existing housing , and try to scale it up .
but you know that you &apos;re looking at the homes and places around that are protected by law to make sure that the buildings are <unk> and entertaining .
it &apos;s very difficult to do these things .
but you can build a new building in an area without development , like the beginning of the <unk> .
so I proposed that the government would set up enough places for the new city and call it the Charter for Compassion .
and at about the same time that I know this , the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> are thinking about <unk> in Honduras .
it &apos;s said that about 12,000 immigrants from the United States every year and they want to ask , what can they do to make sure that these people stay in Honduras &apos; job as well ?
and one time , the <unk> said to the Tower , &quot; If we were to take our land around -- what if we gave it to the embassy -- some of the American embassy ; some <unk> to Canada -- if we wanted to find jobs in Canada or the United States , they would find their way to work in these islands or else ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , Honduras had a military coup .
in the next routine of followed by election , <unk> <unk> made a difference between the election and the peace of peace .
and he invited the tower from <unk> to his <unk> .
at the same time , I was preparing a TEDGlobal Talk .
through a series of <unk> , a lot of users have been testing , trying to take the idea of the Charter , the complex concept of the city and compress it to the most fundamental essence .
the first one is that the significance of the law , as it says , is that you can &apos;t be harassed to the extent it &apos;s written .
we &apos;re focusing on new technologies , but new technologies need technology and demand implementation .
at the end of 2010 , a friend of Guatemala sent a TEDTalk .
and he showed it to <unk> .
they called me .
say , &quot; Let &apos;s show this to our president . &quot;
we touched the conference in Miami in December of Miami in December .
I tried to explain what the city value of these cities is and what its value costs .
I took this slide to show the value of an area like New York , and notice , in some cases , tens of thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it &apos;s a relatively abstract discussion , and it &apos;s a little bit more abstract to say , &quot; Paul , maybe we can watch a TEDTalk . &quot;
and in a nutshell , you &apos;ve written the Charter for Compassion , a form of Charter for Compassion , makes a decision whether or not people want to live in the next lesson .
and the president of Honduras asked the question to the question , who said that we need this project , and that &apos;s the crux of the way we move forward .
I was invited to come and visit this project on January 4 , <unk> .
I showed you another example of this slide , and I tried to tell you about this , and if you want to create huge value in cities , it has to be huge .
this is a photograph from <unk> , which is an airport in Denver : the new Florida airport .
there are more than 100 square kilometers of this single airport .
I tried to convince Honduras for the President , if you want to build a <unk> , you &apos;re going to start at least 1,000 square miles .
that &apos;s bigger than 2,500 acres .
everyone was very polite to be rude .
the expression of the audience is serious and critical .
and the President of the meeting said , &quot; <unk> , thank you for your lecture , but maybe we can take a TEDTalk .
I &apos;ve got one on my laptop now . &quot;
so I sat down , and they watched a TEDTalk .
it also captured the essence of the new city , and it brought people a new choice .
this is an option that you would go to a city , maybe to Honduras rather than the <unk> North .
it also gave leadership new choices .
because the leaders of Honduras &apos; government need a universal help to get the benefits of the Charter to help them set and implement the Charter for everybody to believe that the Charter will actually act .
one of the things that happened to the president was to make sure that I thought that as a way to build cities that would be as important as the ones that have been taken place for years and years and years .
and we went through that area .
this is a photograph there .
it &apos;s a thousand square miles .
and not long after , on January 19 , they passed a vote in Congress to offer a legal support for a specific area .
in the case of the coup government , the country acknowledged the constitution is more than one .
all parties , all parties , in society , support that demand .
as part of the Constitution , you actually need twice as much in Congress .
on February 17th , they passed the bill again than one .
and immediately after the vote , on February 21 to 24 , about 30 people came to two of the most interesting places in the world .
one was Korea .
this is a large building from Korea , a new downtown downtown -- bigger than Boston .
all you &apos;ve seen has been built for four years , but they &apos;ve spent four years building .
another interesting building was Singapore .
they &apos;ve actually built two <unk> in China and built the third one .
if you think about it rationally , that &apos;s our situation .
they had an international site , and they had considered it to be the second city .
they &apos;re entering an legal process to allow the managers to come and have another legal system .
a country has licensed the Supreme Court for the new justice system to become the poster for the final appeal .
this is the city designer and architects that are interested in them .
and it even gave them economic support .
but one of the things that you know about earlier is that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of businesses who want to go there in particular to the United States and to the free trade zone .
there are seven billion people around the world who want to live forever to some place .
one million people went from Latin America every year .
a lot of it is the father who is looking for jobs -- sometimes a single mother to earn money for housing .
sadly , sometimes a child is trying to be reunited with parents that they haven &apos;t seen for a long time , for decades .
how does it take to think about building a <unk> in Honduras ?
or have you built tens of thousands or so developing hundreds of them around the world ?
how does it take to account for every family that has a number of competitive options ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends of mine gave me peace , thank you .
hello . my name is Kevin <unk> . I &apos;m a researcher on YouTube , and my profession is YouTube .
this is real .
so today we &apos;re going to talk about why some of these videos are going to be popular and even important .
we all wanted to be stars -- celebrity , singer , comedian -- and when I was young , it was very , very difficult .
but now online video is making it real , so we can all be creative to do things that we want to do , and then suddenly become part of the world .
any of you can be on a Saturday during the Web .
but every minute there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube .
and in many , only the tiniest proportion of people on this rise will appear to be popular and rise to a culture of <unk> .
how does that happen ?
three keys : <unk> , community engagement and unexpected .
okay , let &apos;s see .
Mr. <unk> gas : Oh , my God . Oh my God .
Oh , my God !
ooh !
Oh , Whoa !
last year , Mr. <unk> <unk> , upload this video of a shot outside of his <unk> park .
in 2010 , the video was watched three million times .
this is a video that just happened to be in the middle of nowhere .
but the bear didn &apos;t have to take pictures that were popular .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because this is what the self @-@ organization is doing .
and he uploaded a lot of video .
this was actually uploaded in January last year .
so what happened ?
that &apos;s Jimmy <unk> .
Jimmy <unk> put a tweet and put it back .
because there were things like Jimmy <unk> , who introduced us to new , interesting things that allowed the audience to come to these things .
Rebecca <unk> : today is Friday , Friday , Friday . play is on Friday . everyone &apos;s expected to go on weekends . Friday , Friday , Friday .
Rebecca <unk> : &quot; Friday &quot; Friday &quot; was one of the Year &apos;s Eve .
this year drew almost 200 million views .
this chart shows the popular trend .
and it was like the movie &quot; <unk> , &quot; and it was like there was suddenly a red cross between .
what happened that day ?
Oh , that was the day , a Friday .
if you &apos;ve questioned the peak , it &apos;s all on Friday .
but what happened on that day ?
it was chosen by <unk> , and many of the tribes <unk> discussion .
now , that &apos;s the mystery of the science theater .
the point here is that there &apos;s a movement or a group of people who looked at the video and they shared their views , and they accelerate through the video .
and it &apos;s a shared joke , and it &apos;s shared , not only to talk about it , but it &apos;s going to <unk> its own version .
so now there &apos;s a thousand <unk> on &quot; Friday &quot; on YouTube .
and even on Monday , there &apos;s a different kind of funny behavior going on Monday .
it &apos;s not like a one @-@ way entertainment media in the 20th century , it &apos;s a collective engagement that allows us to become part of a common phenomenon -- through spread or independently .
this is a piece called &quot; <unk> &quot; which is a continuous music series .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
that &apos;s up to 50 million times this year .
and if you think that &apos;s incredible , you &apos;re much more difficult to imagine this video , and there &apos;s three @-@ hour versions that attract four million people to watch .
and there &apos;s even this video from the <unk> .
the cat is watching this other cat .
but what &apos;s important about this is this technology that motivates ideas , the geeks , the Internet .
and it &apos;s been produced by <unk> .
somebody made nostalgia .
and we walked up and down the street .
the whole <unk> of the Red Cross has made this original joke into something that everybody can collaborate .
because now we &apos;re not only <unk> , we &apos;re also involved .
who knew this ?
who would know that rainbow or <unk> ?
what kind of script do you write in it ?
and on this minute , there &apos;s only two days of the Internet video , and there &apos;s only the unique and incredible video that you can &apos;t imagine .
one of my friends urged a very nice video to be shot by a guy in New York City , and I had to admit that I had no interest .
Casey <unk> : I had a ticket because I didn &apos;t ride on the bike lanes , but often because a lot of obstacles don &apos;t even get you on bike lanes .
Kevin <unk> : in a way that was unexpected , he had this funny idea and he attracted 500 million views .
and that way applies to everything that we have innovations .
so let &apos;s have a problem .
and Mr. <unk> : what does that mean ?
Oh ...
Kevin : what does this mean ?
the wave of ideas , the creative engagement groups , and the <unk> , these are the characteristics of new media and new media that people can participate in and define what &apos;s going on .
and as I do that , <unk> now comes <unk> from the <unk> of YouTube .
your ideas don &apos;t need people .
we all have autonomy in the popular culture .
and it &apos;s not just the old media , nor is it the media of today , but it &apos;s going to be the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
10 minutes later , enough to tell my stories about three generations of women , the incredible strength of this ties with her four @-@ year @-@ olds and her grandmother tied together , five days old with a boat sitting on a boat , and waiting 30 years ago to keep a little girl alive today -- no one &apos;s living in San Francisco today .
a constant story .
it &apos;s like a puzzle that &apos;s being painted .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
the first image in retrospect is a man who works as well .
he was a poet and <unk> who spent his whole life working on the unity and freedom of the country .
imagine him being a communist , and he &apos;s facing his whole life .
the ridicule of friends .
he was quiet .
as history , he &apos;s dead .
he was my grandfather .
I never knew his life .
but our lives are much richer than our memories .
my grandfather gave me his life .
and my job was to stop his experience as being useless , and my responsibility was to learn from the fact that history tried to defeat us all the time .
the next piece of the puzzle was the dawn of the morning , <unk> to the sea .
my mother , <unk> , 18 @-@ year @-@ olds , had two girls .
for her , the only purpose of life was to flee families in Australia .
it was impossible for her .
so , four years of <unk> &apos;s novels , a long boat in the ocean , from fishing boats , from fishing .
the big people know about the dangers .
the biggest threat is piracy , rape and death .
like all adults , my mom took a little bit of poison .
if we were <unk> , my sister , my mother , and my grandmother .
my first memories came from a boat -- the motors , the ups and downs , the sea level .
I don &apos;t remember the pirate supply coming a couple of times , but the man on the ship was scared , and the engine was turned into six hours .
but I remember looking at the <unk> of oil ; it was a young <unk> from the coast of Malaysia ; it was the first apple , a guy from <unk> .
no longer eat that delicious apple .
three months after the prison camp , we settled in Melbourne .
the next piece of the puzzle is the new life that women create together .
we settled on <unk> , a working @-@ class suburban , dominated by migrants .
I didn &apos;t forget my existence , let alone the <unk> .
the store tastes like the taste of another world .
speaking of the same language , people were interacting with each other , and one of the things was the same , and then gradually started .
and the mother started working in rural areas , and then went to the car for six days , six days a week , and <unk> .
and sometimes she would go and learn English and get the IT <unk> .
we &apos;re very poor .
save every dollar . the rest of the money is used to <unk> English and mathematics , whether it &apos;s not new clothes , wear clothes , wear clothes .
and they dressed up in this sock , and there &apos;s another hole .
the uniform of the school system is over the knee , because it has lasted six years .
and while it &apos;s very rare , very few miles in search of <unk> , some graffiti sometimes says , &quot; Asian people go home . &quot;
go home ?
something <unk> my heart .
a force pulls in , quiet voice says , &quot; I &apos;m going to pass you beyond you . &quot;
my sister and my mother slept in the same bed .
mothers drag their families home every night , but we were talking to each other about one day , and they were listening to the acoustic enclosure .
my mother had a nightmare in my life , a boat .
my job was to stay awake , wake her as a nightmare .
and she started a computer store , and she was learning how to build a <unk> .
the story of men , it &apos;s not , it &apos;s mad , it &apos;s boring , it &apos;s like two worlds .
find money and funding .
they built the center .
I live in a parallel world .
on the one hand , I &apos;m a typical Asian student .
on the other hand , I went to the dangers of reality , of violence , of <unk> , of drugs , of apartheid .
but there are so many years of help .
when I was asked for the Olympic Village , I was selected to be the young Australia of that year .
I jumped from one piece to another , no beautiful connection .
<unk> <unk> , an ordinary citizen , now refugees , social activists , invited a talk to a place where no one had ever heard .
I don &apos;t know the agreement .
I don &apos;t know how to use <unk> .
you don &apos;t talk about wine .
it &apos;s not speaking .
I wanted to go back to the past , anonymous , comfortable living in -- the grandmother , present and two girls for 20 years , talking about the past , getting to sleep in bed , three of us still in bed .
I told my mom , I couldn &apos;t do it .
and she reminded me that she took us a boat out of a cruise ship , and it was my age right now .
no choice .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; she said , &quot; to be true . &quot;
so I talked about the job losses and the education issues that I talked about , and I talked about the issues of unemployment , and the lack of political rights .
the more honest I was talking about , the more I talked about it .
we met people around , and we did what they loved .
even though I had completed my studies , I realized that I couldn &apos;t define law enforcement .
here &apos;s another puzzle clip .
at the same time , I realized that being an outsider could also , the latest thing , the news on the screen was not just possible , but something came from a boat .
because being a <unk> , it &apos;s easy to abandon your vision , it &apos;s easy to get your assumptions .
I &apos;ve got to stand now in the comfort zone , and yes , the world started to break apart , not as much as you &apos;re worried about .
you don &apos;t allow for allowing people to zoom in .
there &apos;s energy , ruthless optimism , mixed with people and the courage .
follow my hunch .
I gathered a team that couldn &apos;t do the only challenge we had .
for a year , we didn &apos;t do it .
and at the end of the day , I had a big share of people .
every night , working hard .
most of our ideas are crazy , and a few are smart , and we breakthrough .
I felt like moving to America .
after a trip .
my intuition ran over and over again .
I got to three months , and I continued to take risks .
at the end , let me say my grandmother .
she grew up in the middle of a massive epidemic , and she was the biggest person in the world .
life in centuries had never changed .
she was born , and her father died .
it was raised by the mother alone .
she married an old girl who was 17 years old enough to be a <unk> , a <unk> girl .
there was no husband &apos;s support , taking her husband to the court , <unk> , winning her reputation .
impossible is possible .
and when she was in Melbourne about 600 miles away , I was shower in Sydney .
through the glass , I saw her standing across .
I knew she was a good bye .
my mom &apos;s phone rang a few minutes later .
and a few days later , we went to <unk> , and we sat next to her coffin .
we tell stories , and we promise her we &apos;re always with her .
and it was told by midnight that he had to cover the coffin .
my mom made us feel the grandmother &apos;s hand .
and she said , &quot; Why is it that the grandmother &apos;s hand is Van <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been on the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you never let go . &quot;
if we have mobility in our family , it must be women .
and if we think about our own and lifestyle , we can now see that a man has to cut us out . we have to cut up .
it &apos;s easy to fail .
now I want my child , my own boat .
who would not ?
and I was afraid of privilege , privilege and power .
the oars of their lives , the brave <unk> , the ups and downs , the engines , the general field , the general field , the <unk> vision , could I do it ?
I don &apos;t know .
but I could let it go , look at their safety , and that &apos;s what I want .
and at the same time , this is where we are today , we have four , three quarters .
today I want to share with you my photography .
or is this a photograph ?
because this is obviously a photograph , but it &apos;s a photograph you didn &apos;t take with a camera .
however , my interest in photography started when I first got my first digital camera .
it was buried in my passion for drawing , but it was a little different because the actual process of using the camera is already ahead .
and when you take a camera and you shoot the camera , the whole process is over .
so it seems to me that photography is more about the appropriate places and time .
I think anyone can do it .
so what I wanted to do was to do something special was to start the process as you beat the shutter .
here &apos;s a photo : a busy highway is being built .
but it was surprising .
but nonetheless , it remains a sense of <unk> .
or there &apos;s a photograph like this , which has color and color , but it &apos;s all about trying to preserve a sense of <unk> .
and what I &apos;m talking about is what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m talking about , what I &apos;m
because it &apos;s not something you can really grab , but I always wanted to make it look like a way to get caught .
these pictures need to be able to quickly figure out the skills behind them .
so what &apos;s more about it is capturing an idea rather than capturing a moment of actual existence .
but what does it take to make these pictures look realistic ?
what about the details ? what about color ?
what about light ?
what made it possible ?
and sometimes you get different perspectives .
but ultimately , it &apos;s important to think about how we understand the world and how we understand it in a two @-@ dimensional space .
it &apos;s not about what it is , it &apos;s about what we think looks like .
so I think these ingredients are simple .
I think of it as a kind of a puzzle in the real world where you can combine different pieces of the real world together to create a real reality .
let me give you a simple example .
there are three things that can be imagined and real , and we can find them in the real three @-@ dimensional world .
but if you combine these objects in a way , you can create visual objects that are still three @-@ dimensional , as if it &apos;s there .
but at the same time , we know it &apos;s not possible .
and we &apos;re cheating our own brain , because the brain is not going to have that fact .
and that &apos;s what happens .
it &apos;s just a combination of different things .
so what makes a photo look like is things that we normally don &apos;t even think of as things that look like , but in our daily life .
but when we combine that , it &apos;s worth remembering that otherwise it might seem a bit odd .
and what I want to suggest is that we have to follow three simple principles that act like this .
you see , these images are not special .
but together they can create this .
so the first principle is that all of the photographs that are taken together show the same angle .
secondly , the same amount of light that comes together .
both of these photographs fit in the same way that they were taken from the same height and the same light .
and the third principle is , it &apos;s hard to figure out how to tell the difference between these different pictures and what makes the bridge look like .
and it &apos;s not just how this image works .
by matching the colors of the colors of the photo array , the <unk> and the <unk> of the image , the depth of the depth and the noise of the eye , we can remove the boundary between the various photographs and make it look like a single photo , even though there &apos;s a photo .
here &apos;s another example .
some of you might think that this is just a piece of paper underneath it .
but this photo is actually taken from many different places .
I personally think that creating a place is easier to find than find a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise your own mind .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and when this came to mind last winter , I knew that I had a few months to design this thing , and it was basically going to take a picture of this puzzle .
this fish , for example , was a <unk> .
the coast of the coast shot at another location .
the depth of the water was taken by a quarry .
and by the way , I put it in red , and it made it look more wind .
in order to achieve something like that , I think the most important thing is plan .
it always comes up with the idea and the idea .
and that &apos;s a different picture .
every single one of these photographs is taken by the plan .
if you could get a good photo , it would be beautiful , and it would be very nice .
so all of the tools that we have in there are , in fact , our imagination .
thank you .
I &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many digital healthcare programs failed .
and I think the most important thing is that we don &apos;t listen to patients .
one of the things that we did at the University of Holland was appointed a <unk> .
not in a very scientific way -- she has a coffee or a cup , a family , a relative ?
what needs us ? &quot;
and I think that we would like to think that this is one of the main causes of almost all electronic healthcare programs that we don &apos;t listen to .
this is my weight gain , and this is a very simple thing .
here &apos;s a switch .
every morning I weigh it .
<unk> , I set myself a nickname , as you can see .
I set the weight up .
in fact , the whole operation was very simple , and it sent my data to Google .
at the same time , my doctor , he could be received , and then he could see what my weight had , not when he had a heart attack , but when he had a heart attack , he was looking at the weight .
but here &apos;s another thing .
some of you may know that I have <unk> fans on Twitter .
so every morning I weighed <unk> weight , and before I got on my car , people started talking to me , &quot; I think you &apos;re lunch today or Jane . &quot;
but that &apos;s great , because it &apos;s peer @-@ to @-@ peer pressure , it helps patients with stress -- it helps to treat obesity .
but on the other hand , it can also bring people together in some kind of play @-@ like games to keep healthy .
the next week , the next week is over .
there &apos;s a little phone like this that connects to the smartphone or some other equipment .
and then people measured their blood pressure in their home , and they sent it to their doctors and other people shared it for $ 100 .
and that &apos;s the crux , when the patient is collecting data , they &apos;re not only able to control the data themselves , but they &apos;re also going to be able to deal with the challenges we have in our healthcare care , things like Medicaid , or demand , etc .
we &apos;ve got to get technology in order to get people to track their tracks .
you can do that with technology .
today I &apos;m going to show you a project that we &apos;ve been working on .
we have mobile devices in our cars .
it &apos;s even mobile .
we know where the ATM machines are .
you know where the gas station is .
of course , fast food .
but the nearest <unk> of the patient &apos;s lives , where are the <unk> ?
and we were asked everywhere .
no one knew that I was going to be able to live my life .
we sent it to the Dutch mission .
we built a website that said to people , &quot; If you see a <unk> , please mark it on the Web , and it &apos;s open because it &apos;s not necessarily opened for 24 hours .
in the Netherlands , we have <unk> tagged .
the next step is to develop appropriate apps .
we developed an iPad .
an <unk> app , <unk> , <unk> , looking for <unk> .
if you see someone in <unk> , you can actually use an iPhone in a couple of weeks , and Microsoft has found a recent saving .
what I want to talk to you about today is not just the name of that product , but the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to push this project around the world .
and we &apos;re also calling to colleagues and universities all over the world to help us figure out how to do things together .
so when you go out and you see someone who &apos;s dead , maybe your family or your way to someone else , you find your family .
and we also wanted to call for companies around the world to be able to test them .
for example , maybe sending a <unk> or a <unk> to see if the flag &apos;s still there .
so please , in this case , help us not only make us healthy , we can make them better .
thank you .
today , I &apos;m going to talk about some unexpected discoveries .
now I &apos;m working on solar energy .
and the company that I just founded was asking us to engage us in a natural way and look at it .
you can &apos;t see it .
this is a video of what we &apos;re doing .
ah , wait .
it takes some time .
maybe we can skip -- I &apos;ll skip the video .
don &apos;t do it .
that &apos;s not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
wouldn &apos;t it be my time ?
all right , thank you very much .
a few years ago , I started a project where some incredible people were using technology and design were working in a situation where they were meant to represent everything they wanted to be -- government @-@ to @-@ day projects .
this project is called &quot; The United States Code , &quot; a little bit like <unk> .
we take a couple of people every year and we work them for governments .
they don &apos;t send them to the third world , but they send them to the city hall .
there , they created wonderful applications , working with the city council .
but the real goal is to show the possibility that technology can create today .
this is Al .
Al was a fire hydrant in the inner city .
it looks like it &apos;s waiting for its date , but what it &apos;s really waiting for is a person that can break it up when it &apos;s <unk> , because it knows that when it &apos;s <unk> at four feet , its ability to melt down .
how does it work in a particular way ?
last year we &quot; The United States Code &quot; has a team at <unk> .
they were in February , and there were a lot of them last year .
and they noticed that the fire hydrant had very little caught in the city .
one of the guys in that group , Erik <unk> -- he &apos;s got another phenomenon : the citizens <unk> out the front of the fire hydrant .
so he did something that any good programmer would do , and he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a lovely program for you to adopt a fire hydrant .
and then you agreed to mine it in snow .
if you did that , you could give it a name ; he called the first Al .
but if you don &apos;t know it , other people steal it from you .
so it has a little bit of fun in it .
this is a relatively small program .
it might be the smallest act of a team that wrote that year .
but it did something other government couldn &apos;t do .
it &apos;s like a virus .
and one of the IT workers in Honolulu , which came to work in Honolulu , and realized that it wasn &apos;t necessarily meant to use it to <unk> the snow , it could use it as a bird for the adoption .
these tsunami functions important , but people steal the battery from them .
so he asked citizens to examine them .
and Seattle then decided to use it to get citizens to clean up the sewer channels .
and Chicago started using it to get people out of the mountains .
we now know there are nine cities that are being used .
and it just <unk> , organic , natural , spread out .
if you know something about government , you know , it &apos;s not common .
developing a software would take a few years .
last year we had a team of three people working on a project for two and a half months .
it can help parents decide which public schools are best for their children .
and then we were told , if this project went on normally , it would take at least two years , and it would take about two million dollars .
and this is just a small number .
California has a program that costs 20 billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are all kinds of projects in government .
so a program that takes just a few days to program , and works like a virus , is a <unk> for the government .
it sees that government can be more efficient -- but not more private companies , like many people think .
it wasn &apos;t even a tech company , but it was more like the Internet itself .
that means you don &apos;t have to approve them , you know , they &apos;re available .
and that &apos;s important .
but what this program represents , more importantly , is that the next generation of people are looking at the problem of government as a group of issues to solve the problem , not a form of institutions .
and that &apos;s a great message , because , as it turns out , we &apos;re very good at the technology community .
now there &apos;s a very large community built that allows us to do things more efficiently .
it &apos;s not just the people in the United States code , but it has hundreds of people in the country who write code every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up government .
and while they were disappointed , they didn &apos;t complain , and they were trying to improve it .
these people know something we &apos;ve lost .
and that is , when you peel everything that makes us angry , like our sense of politics , and the long lines outside of the vehicle , the government , in the center of it , says , &quot; The government can do something for us . &quot;
there are a lot of people who are totally <unk> about the government .
if you &apos;re one of them , I want you to think about it , because a lot of things are changing .
politics has not changed , but governments are changing .
and because of the power of the government , the power of the government , in the most fundamental sense , comes from our people , how we see it going to affect its transformation .
when I started this project , I didn &apos;t know much about government .
like a lot of people , I think the government is just a selection staff .
two years later , I had a message . the government , in particular , was the government .
and here &apos;s the phone center for service and information .
if you call the <unk> in your city , you &apos;re going to be connected to that .
if you &apos;re going to get a chance to work at the center of your town center , like some of our projects , Scott <unk> did this -- they actually had to do this service -- you would see people call in very different issues , including having a government consultant , including having a telephone .
Scott got this call .
he put his word out , and he typed it into an official <unk> .
nothing . he started with the animal control center .
and in the end , he said , &quot; Well , you can open up all your door and open your door and stare out loud and see if it &apos;s going to go away ? &quot;
and that worked . Scott , <unk> .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the story .
there &apos;s no waiting room number .
it has a program , a website and a mobile project called &quot; citizen <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write the program .
it &apos;s a brilliant group of people who write in new structures at the office of the city .
there was a day when the information came out , and there was a real report that came out : &quot; there &apos;s a trash bin . you can &apos;t see if it died .
how do I get it ? &quot;
citizens connected to this problem in different ways .
Scott &apos;s communication was human .
but it &apos;s freely accessible by citizens , so everyone can see .
this time , a neighbor saw it .
the next report we got was this : &quot; I walked by the site and found the trash behind the house .
have I ever seen it ? I &apos;m alive .
put the trash in , put it home .
go ahead and get it . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
so that &apos;s good . that &apos;s the reality and the digital world .
it &apos;s also a great example of how government plays an <unk> game .
but it &apos;s also a great example of a government that &apos;s done by government .
and I &apos;m not here to tell you about the definition of the platform .
I just want to mention a platform where people can help each other .
a citizen helped another citizen , and the government plays an important role .
it just <unk> two strands .
it can be used by government services to help people need it , but a neighbor is far more simple than simple and affordable .
when one of our neighborhoods help another , our social links expanded .
we call the animal control center a lot of money .
one of the things that we need to think about is that governments are different than politics .
a lot of people understand this , but they still think that politics is the input of government .
our input from the government system is through the ballot .
so far , we &apos;ve chosen a lot of political leaders -- and sometimes we spend a lot of our energy trying to support a new political leader -- and we expect government to do something about our values and what we need , but not much change ?
that &apos;s because governments are like a huge ocean , and politics is just the top layer .
the bottom one is what we call the <unk> .
we talked about it in such a way .
but it was this desire that we had and paid for what we were paying for , that we were losing our own energy .
people seem to think that politics is sexy .
if we want the department to serve us , we have to make it sexy .
because the real government is there .
we have to participate in government systems .
and this is what the United States National Security Council does .
have you ever met these people ?
they were an incredibly wealthy citizen , and they wrote a very detailed , and about half @-@ page report came to respond to the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations .
it &apos;s not about participation , it &apos;s about active engagement .
now , for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time to ask ourselves what kind of world we want to leave .
you have to realize that they have to face enormous challenges .
are we really sure that we can achieve what we want to achieve before we don &apos;t get better ?
we can &apos;t have government . we need it to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is embodied as it becomes possible to redefine government &apos;s function in nature , and we can use it to enhance our citizens .
now the next generation is growing up in the Web , and they know that doing one thing at the same time , it &apos;s hard to build systems .
the average age of our staff was 28 years old , so I was pretty miserable , almost bigger than most of them .
this generation has become used to them .
they don &apos;t have to go through our generation about who can have free speech ; they all have free speech .
they can talk to their opinions through any channel , and they do .
so when they &apos;re confronted with a flaw in government , they don &apos;t care about using their own voice .
they use their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write programs that make government work better .
and these programs allow us to optimize our own hands .
it could be designed to take a fire hydrant , a <unk> , or a trash could put into a garbage bin .
and of course , a lot of people were starting to get a fire hydrant .
but these programs are like a small alarm clock , so you can remind us that we &apos;re not just consumers , we &apos;re not just consumers , we &apos;re not just paying attention to the cost of the government .
not only are we , we are citizens .
before we improve government , we have to take responsibility as citizens .
so here &apos;s the question I leave you with : when we &apos;re faced with a lot of big , important , and we need to do something together , we &apos;re just going to have a voice , or are we going to be a group of people who are going to be <unk> ?
thank you .
and since I &apos;ve been explaining to people how wonderful new technologies are going to be coming , I think since I &apos;ve been with the tech community since I &apos;ve been here to demonstrate and understand how this has happened , it seems to me that we don &apos;t catch up with technologies .
let me start with a page of boring technologies .
and you can start putting the slides .
this is just a random sample of my file .
what I want you to see is not the details of it , but the overall form of it .
this is a slide that we did on the <unk> <unk> , with the power of the local power .
and what &apos;s interesting is that a slide like so many of our familiar slides , which is a semi @-@ log straight line .
and that &apos;s where each layer , which represents the size of performance .
on a semi @-@ log plot , it &apos;s fresh .
that &apos;s a little bit curious .
that &apos;s basically what I want to say .
take a break .
and I &apos;m going to flash them up , because I &apos;m going to use my ink .
why should we use a log curve to describe the technology curves ?
well , the answer is , if I use a regular curve , we say , this is the year , this is the time , and this is a measurement of the technology that I &apos;m prepared to draw , it &apos;s a little silly .
it &apos;s a bit like this .
and there was no information .
now , if I do , for example , another technology , like transportation , on a semi @-@ log plot , it looks like a <unk> line .
but if you show something like this , it looks like this .
if transportation advances were as fast as it were , then I could <unk> a cab on a taxi and go to Tokyo in 30 seconds .
but it didn &apos;t grow so fast .
there &apos;s no self @-@ sustaining in technology , doubling every few years .
now I want to ask you , if you look at these exponential curves , they &apos;re not sustainable .
things can &apos;t change so fast .
two things happen .
or it turns into something like this , a typical S @-@ curves all the way , or something like this .
that &apos;s all possible .
now I &apos;m an optimist , so I think it &apos;s possible to turn into this .
and if that &apos;s true , it means that we &apos;re at the moment in time .
we seem to be on this line , moving from the world to the future .
all I have to ask , I &apos;ve been asking myself , where is the future of the world ?
what would it look like to be a new age ?
because this change seemed to be very , very confusing , when we were in it .
when I was growing up , the future was like 2000 , people were discussing what would happen in 2000 .
now at this conference , you &apos;re talking about the future , and you can see that the future is 2000 .
that &apos;s how far we can get .
in other words , the future of my life is declining .
and I think the reason is that we all felt what was happening .
the change is happening . we can see .
we know that for the next three , 50 years , there &apos;s no reason why , because everything is so different that no longer exists .
so I &apos;m going to talk about what that would be like .
and to do that , I have to introduce a whole bunch of things that are completely different from technology and computers .
because the only way I decided to understand this was to look back in time and time again .
and the time I want to look at the timeline is through time of life on Earth .
and I want to suggest that this picture makes sense if you look at it from billions of years .
so if you look back in about 25 billion years , the Earth is this big , barren rock with some chemicals .
if we look at how these chemicals combine , we start to figure out how they form .
and I think there &apos;s some theories about how life started from RNA , but I want to tell you a simple story about life , which is , at that time , there &apos;s a sea @-@ level of oil flowing in it , and there &apos;s all kinds of different chemistry .
some oil droplet has a specific chemistry , and that makes it possible for them to come from the outside world to come together .
it starts to differentiate between things like this .
the original ones , at some point , have these little oil prices .
but these oil prices are not real alive now , because each of us is a random chemical .
every once divided , it &apos;s not an average @-@ distributed chemical .
so each oil droplet has a bit different .
in fact , the oil droplet , and different ways of making it more integrated , is to make it larger , to grow more and to divide .
so they do it much longer . they do it much more .
it &apos;s a bit like a simple chemical form of life , but the process gets interesting when the oil droplet has learned to provide information .
and somehow , we can &apos;t really understand the way we understand it , and they learn to record information .
they learn to form the secret of the cell to a specific substance called &quot; go to <unk> . &quot;
in other words , they came up with , in this sort of evolutionary way , to write down their genetic information , so that they could be copied in this way .
and the surprise was that this type of record seemed to last 25 million years .
in fact , our genes form exactly the same code , the same way .
in fact , any organism is written in a completely identical letter and code .
in fact , one of the things I &apos;ve done for fun is that we can record things with this code .
I &apos;ve got 100 @-@ plus <unk> , and I &apos;m trying to get them out of the airports .
but what I &apos;ve done here is I take this code , and it has the criteria that we use to tag it , and then I write my business card to an oxygen box , and it goes up to 22 times .
so if somebody needs a million of my business card , I &apos;ve got enough money to give everyone in this room , even everyone around the world .
if I were a <unk> , I would put it in a virus .
so what &apos;s next ?
it &apos;s an interesting step to document oxygen .
it causes cells to form -- and they &apos;re happy billions of years .
but there &apos;s another really interesting component that begins to become completely different , and that is that these cells start exchanging and communicating information to the cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , that bacteria can actually exchange for oxygen .
and that &apos;s why , for example , evolution has <unk> immune .
some bacteria know how to get away from penicillin , and it creates this oxygen for <unk> , and it goes around another organism , and now we have a lot of immune to penicillin , because the bacteria are communicating information .
so these communication communities form , in a sense , they &apos;re on the same boat ; they &apos;re collaborative .
so they survive together , or they die , which means that if a community is successful , then the individuals in the community can replicate more , evolution is much more helpful .
and so , shifted to that , when these groups are very close to each other , in fact , they gather together and decided to write an element in the <unk> of an entire population .
the next interesting stage in life is over billions of years .
in this period of time , there are many cells , many different types of cells , working together as organisms .
in fact , we are the cells .
we have a lot of cells , and they &apos;re not just for themselves .
the skin doesn &apos;t work , without the cardiac cells , the muscle cells , the brain cells , etc .
so these groups started to evolve , and interesting evolution stopped just single cells , but we called the organism .
and that &apos;s what happens in these communities .
these cells , again , start to extract information .
they &apos;re starting to build very specific structures about the population .
these are nerves .
so neurons are the kind of information processing tools that these cells have .
in fact , the communities begin to appear experts and track specific structures , understanding information .
this is the brain and the nervous system of these cells .
this gives them the evolution of evolution .
because then , for each individual -- learning can happen in a single organism , not a whole time .
so an organism can , for example , learn to eat some kind of fruit , because it &apos;s not a good thing and it &apos;s disgusting .
this could happen in a single organism &apos;s life , and then , before that particular information processing structure was built , it took thousands of years to learn , thousands of years to die from this fruit .
so the nervous system , <unk> this special structure , has accelerated evolution .
because this has evolved to happen in individuals .
it can happen within time of learning .
but what happened next was that every single individual discovered , of course , the secret of communication .
so , for example , the most sophisticated version we know is human language .
think about it . it &apos;s a wonderful invention .
I had a complicated , chaotic , chaotic thought .
and I &apos;m sitting here , basically <unk> sound , hoping to create a sort of chaotic form in your mind .
but we &apos;re transforming complex things into sound , streams of sound , and we &apos;re generating complex things in your brain .
so now that &apos;s driving us to work as a single organism .
so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , human beings , we start <unk> .
we &apos;re going through the same stages of multi @-@ cellular organism -- taking our records , showing us the way information works .
so for example , the invention of language is very small steps .
phone , computers , <unk> , <unk> , all of which are our special mechanisms , where we &apos;re building mechanisms for information .
all of this is connecting us , changing faster , faster than we were before .
so , there &apos;s now a subtle time scale of evolution .
you &apos;ve seen that little example of evolution that &apos;s sort of evolved in this little package of software that you see here .
so now we speed up time .
the first step that I told you about is spending billions of years .
the next step , like the nervous system and the brain , takes millions of years .
and then again , like language and so forth , it takes less than a million years .
the next step , like the electronics , is like a few decades .
and the process is self @-@ sufficient , and it &apos;s become , I guess , to self @-@ invent -- to speed up the speed of change .
the more the change , the faster it is .
and I think that &apos;s what we see here .
we see the process giving back to ourselves .
my job right now is to design computers , and I know that the mechanisms to design computers can &apos;t exist if there &apos;s no latest advances in computers .
now , what I do is design complexity to objects that don &apos;t design in the conventional wisdom .
I don &apos;t know if I connect to machines .
it &apos;s billions of dollars .
in fact , the designers that I &apos;ve been working on , the kinds of thinking machines , we think it &apos;s a kind of information , and then passing it to the machine that &apos;s beyond what we can do , and it &apos;s much greater than what we &apos;ve ever been doing .
in fact , sometimes it &apos;s used methods that we don &apos;t understand very well .
one of the interesting things that I &apos;ve been working on recently is evolution itself .
and what we did was we put in a machine and we put in a process of evolution that could happen in a subtle amount of time .
for example , most extreme situations , we can actually start to evolve a program from random instructions .
say , &quot; computer , please give you 100,000 random instructions .
now , please run all of these random instructions , run all of these programs , and pick them up the ones that I want . &quot;
in other words , I define what I want .
suppose I need to categorize data , which is a simple example I &apos;ve experimented with .
find the most close @-@ knit program .
and of course , the random instructions are very impossible to categorize data , so there &apos;s not one of them .
but there &apos;s one in the middle , and it &apos;s good , and it probably takes two numbers .
and I said , &quot; The computer , please , you &apos;ve chosen 10 percent of the sequence .
save this . delete it .
now to replicate all of this stuff .
and then re @-@ <unk> them with something like this .
take two programs that exchange them for their children , and these kids inherit two generations of programs .
so I got a new generation of programmers that are doing better .
say , &quot; Please repeat this process . &quot;
do it again .
maybe introduce some mutations .
let &apos;s try it again in a new generation .
each of these generations requires a few milliseconds .
so what I &apos;ve done on the computer for a few minutes is equivalent to the evolution of the evolution of millions of years , or , complex , within hours .
at the end of the day , I had programs that were completely <unk> .
in fact , these programs are much more effective than my hand @-@ held devices .
now , if I read these programs , I don &apos;t know how they work .
I tried to read and explain how they work .
they &apos;re abstract . they &apos;re strange .
but they can do the task .
in fact , I know that I &apos;m confident that they can do the task , because they come from 10 million programmers that can do that .
in fact , their life is the work .
I once sat with <unk> <unk> , and he pulled out a single card and said , &quot; Look , look at this .
it says , &quot; Ben , there &apos;s a lot of complex things to do to keep you safe . &quot; isn &apos;t it going to make you confident ? &quot;
in fact , we know that engineering complexity doesn &apos;t really work very well .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers for a very different process .
it allows us to produce more complex things than normal projects .
yet , we don &apos;t yet understand its choices .
in a sense , computers are way ahead of us .
and we &apos;re now working with these programs to create faster computers so that we can run faster .
so it &apos;s self @-@ feedback .
and that became even faster , and that &apos;s why I felt that computers were pretty annoying .
all of these technologies give back to themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and we &apos;re at one point in time , and this is kind of like a single @-@ celled organism that is turning into multiple cells .
we &apos;re kind of amoeba <unk> . there &apos;s something that we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re at the tipping point .
but I think there must be something with us .
I think it &apos;s a cult of our ultimate invention .
and I think all of us are part of reproduce , whatever the next step is .
it &apos;s coming up , and I &apos;m not picked up , and I think I &apos;m finishing right here .
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
I spent most of my time in prison , on death row .
most of the time , I work in low @-@ income communities , in desperate areas , in terrible places .
and this is a very exciting talk today at TED that I &apos;ve given .
and in this short period of time , I noticed that TED has its own place .
you can see what happens here , and it affects the world .
and sometimes when things happen at the TED stage , it &apos;s a little bit more useful than others .
I mention this because I think self @-@ position is important .
we &apos;ve heard some wonderful talks .
we &apos;ve learned that as a teacher , you have influence , and if you &apos;re a very charitable teacher , you teach them to do it extraordinarily well .
as a doctor , you can help people , if you &apos;re a doctor of a <unk> , you can help more .
so I want to talk about the importance of place .
I didn &apos;t learn from being a lawyer or doing other projects .
I actually learned it from my grandmother .
my family was a traditional black family , and there was only one <unk> , my grandmother .
she was tough . she was tough .
she has a fight , she has an influence .
but a lot of things happened to her .
her parents were the ones who really were the ones .
in the mid @-@ 1990s , her parents were <unk> .
my grandmother was born in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , and her parents were asked to see the world .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also very strong .
when I was a boy , every time I saw her embracing me .
so she &apos;s holding this tight , and I &apos;ll come back , and she &apos;ll let me go .
and a couple of hours later , when I was bye , she would come and ask me , &quot; Can I feel my hug ? &quot;
and if I said , &quot; I can &apos;t feel that , &quot; she &apos;ll let me go . &quot;
and that &apos;s the ability to get close to her .
the only challenge was she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of 10 .
it &apos;s hard to notice when I go close to my grandmother and to my grandmother .
I had always been around .
I remember , I woke up when I was in the morning , and I woke up , and I was running into the living room .
my grandmother was sitting on the other side of the room looking at me .
at first I thought we were playing games .
and I went back , and I smiled her , but my grandmother was serious .
about 15 or so later , she stood up and she walked over the room and she said to me , &quot; Come on , Brian , we have to talk about it . &quot;
it was like it was just yesterday .
I was never going to die .
and she took me aside and she said , &quot; I want to talk to you about something , you don &apos;t want to tell anybody . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK , grandmother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; <unk> &apos;t say anything . &quot; and I said , &quot; promise . &quot;
and we sat down , and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to see me for a while . &quot;
and she said , &quot; You &apos;re a special child . &quot;
and she said , &quot; I &apos;m sure you can do anything . &quot;
I &apos;ll never forget that .
and she said , &quot; I want you to give me three things . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK grandmother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; One , I want you to make sure you will always love your mother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; Your mother is my cousin , and you have to promise you will never love her . &quot;
I love my mom . I said , &quot; OK , grandmother , I will . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; The second thing , you have to agree that you will always walk forever , even if it &apos;s difficult to walk . &quot;
and I thought to myself , &quot; OK grandmother , I will . &quot;
and she said , &quot; The third thing , I want you to keep breathing . &quot;
I was nine years old , and I said , &quot; OK , grandmother , I promise you . &quot;
I grew up in the countryside in the south , and I had a brother , and I had a one @-@ year @-@ old sister . I was one @-@ year @-@ olds .
and one day my brother and I went back to the <unk> beer -- I don &apos;t know how he got -- he took me and my sister and he went to the trees .
he went crazy .
he drank a beer , gave my sister , and she drank my sister and they handed me .
and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t want it . you drink it . I don &apos;t drink it . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; Oh yeah , we &apos;re drinking it right now , and we &apos;re all drinking it right now .
I drank a little bit , and my sister drank a little bit , and you were crying . &quot;
and I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want to drink . you drink you . &quot;
my brother <unk> me .
ask , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? drink a little bit . &quot;
and then he looked at me for a moment , and he said to me , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re not thinking about raising my grandmother for sure . &quot;
and I said , &quot; What are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; <unk> and every <unk> said he was special . &quot;
I &apos;m sad .
now I want to make a confession to you .
maybe not .
because this talk is everywhere .
I took a break this year , and I will admit to you that I never had a drop of wine .
it &apos;s not just to mention the power of self @-@ awareness .
and when we decided to have the right situation , we could have the world accepted things .
we can make the world do what they couldn &apos;t do .
and when I was thinking about my grandmother , she was , of course , incredibly special to everybody .
my grandfather was banned to prison .
I wasn &apos;t just a uncle who was dying and drunk disease .
these are the principles that my grandmother believed that we should persist .
what I want to talk to you about is our criminal law system .
and it changed a lot in 40 years .
in 1972 , only 300,000 people in prison .
today , there &apos;s <unk> .
today the United States is the highest proportion of people in the world .
we have seven million people , seven million people , six and a half million people .
and it seemed to me that a lot of those crimes have changed our world .
in poor communities , in color communities , they &apos;re surrounded by despair , and despair is transformed by these changes .
a third of all black men and women between 18 and 30 percent of black men are not in prison , which is the period of time .
in urban communities all over the country -- Los Angeles , Baltimore , D.C. -- 50 to 60 percent of young people who are not in jail , in prison , in a state period of time .
our judicial system , not only changed , but <unk> around race , has <unk> around poverty .
the justice system in this country will tell you that if you &apos;re a convicted rich person , not an innocent person .
wealth , not <unk> , determines the end result .
and yet , we &apos;re pretty good at this .
play with fear and anger , the wrist <unk> convinced us .
there &apos;s nothing left .
I was interested in this .
we see a bunch of really interesting transformation in our everyday work .
I was in Alabama , like many other states , if you &apos;re sentenced to a life where you &apos;re sentenced to a life @-@ free political power .
now , 30 percent of black men in Alabama are never allowed to vote .
we &apos;re going to move forward to 10 years , and this is going to take away the law of political rights and vote as fast as it was before .
and nobody says half the word .
I represent children .
many of my <unk> were young .
the United States is the only country in the world that will live forever .
I had a life sentence for children &apos;s life , and I was not allowed to survive .
we &apos;re actually sponsor these people appeal .
there &apos;s a world .
I was also on death row .
the death penalty was sobering .
the fundamental problem that we learn from specific sources is that people tend to sin their own crimes .
that &apos;s a perfectly reasonable question .
but the other thing is our self @-@ portrait .
the other way to think about it is that people don &apos;t deserve to be crimes , but we don &apos;t deserve to kill them .
I mean , it &apos;s pretty shocking .
death penalty in the United States is always the result .
one out of nine people who were convicted of a death penalty was later proven to have a death sentence .
this <unk> -- one in nine people who are innocent .
I have to say , it &apos;s just phenomenal .
and the people who learned that , if an airplane in an airline plane would have an accident , we would certainly not fly the driver .
but somehow we can ignore the death penalty problem .
because that &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our own problems .
it &apos;s not our own struggle .
I talked a lot about it .
race , and we don &apos;t deserve to be executed .
it &apos;s alarming . when I teach African history , I talk to students about slavery .
talk to them about terrorism , which started as a great recovery , which began in World War II .
we don &apos;t really understand that history .
but for the black people in this country , that &apos;s a historical era .
in many neighborhoods , people were scared to be executed .
people worry about being attacked by bombs .
it changed their lives .
and people were older now , and they said to me , &quot; Mr. <unk> , you &apos;ve got to tell you about what was the first time we ever had terrorism in the United States . &quot;
they let me say , &quot; We are born in horror . &quot;
the age of terrorism , of course , evolved into <unk> , for decades .
and yet , our country doesn &apos;t like to talk about existence .
we don &apos;t like to talk about history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what we &apos;ve done .
we are constantly creating conflict .
we make intense atmosphere .
we can &apos;t talk about race , I believe , because we don &apos;t want to face a series of facts , we don &apos;t want to survive .
in South Africa , people know that we can &apos;t forget about apartheid unless we &apos;re honest with it .
in Rwanda , even after the genocide , people have faced it , but we don &apos;t want to .
I also talked about death penalty issues in Germany .
and as it turns out , there &apos;s a wonderful fellow academics around and say , &quot; You know , it &apos;s dreadful . &quot;
and she said , &quot; We don &apos;t have death in Germany .
of course , our Germany could never have a death penalty . &quot;
and all the women said , &quot; Because of our history , we &apos;re not going to be systematically killing people .
a <unk> and <unk> execution , a sense of <unk> , a sense of conscience that we have .
and I thought about that .
what would I feel if I &apos;d been looking at the German slaughter all day ?
I couldn &apos;t see it .
that &apos;s pretty embarrassing .
but in our country , in the South states , we were really killing -- when the victim is white , not black , and when you get a death penalty rate 10 times the size of a death sentence , when you get sued only because you were taught to be black , not because you were killed by white , you were killed by a death penalty .
we haven &apos;t heard yet .
I believe that we have a camp .
and when we &apos;re really concerned about these intractable problems , we still care about those positive things as well .
we love to innovate .
we love technology . we love to create .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately all of these good things were suffering from suffering , from suffering , from human rights , from human rights , to human rights , to aspirations .
for me , the two are necessary .
because ultimately , what we &apos;re talking about is , we &apos;re going to talk about the challenges of living in this complex society .
for me , it takes time to think about the income of the poor , the vulnerable , the ones that never came to TED .
but they &apos;re actually sort of <unk> them into our lives .
you know , ultimately , we have to believe that things don &apos;t see .
we had to . we had to be smart , smart society .
innovation , creation , not just in our mind .
these are the products of our brains , combined with our beliefs .
and I believe that in one hand , that motivates us not only for the light , but also for the dark and thorny things that we do .
<unk> <unk> , the brilliant leaders of the <unk> , talked about it .
he said , &quot; When we solve problems in Eastern Europe , we &apos;d like to do a lot of things , but most importantly , we want a soul to point to an experience of despair and the willingness of our collective consciousness . &quot;
and the point of the mind is that my core beliefs about our TED community are also about participation .
there &apos;s nothing to do with the technologies and the perfect design and the separation of our humanity , and as long as we can see it , as long as we can see it , the science , the discipline , the <unk> , the science and the beauty .
and I want to remind you that this is a very challenging position than people who don &apos;t care .
it affects you .
when I was a young lawyer , I was lucky enough to see Miss <unk> .
<unk> , once in a while , went on , met with two friends of mine , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who was the organizer of the buses of the buses of the bus -- very brilliant black women -- and also a black woman named Virginia <unk> , a white woman named Martin Luther King .
these women get together and talk about issues .
and sometimes the <unk> would call me and ask me , &quot; Miss <unk> come back , we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
would you rather have a conversation ? &quot;
and I would say , &quot; Yes , ma &apos;am , I would love that . &quot;
and she said , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; I want to hear that . &quot;
and then I used to listen , just listen .
these parties were very excited and inspiring .
and one time I was listening to these women &apos;s conversations , and she asked me , &quot; Brian , tell me about your equality initiative .
tell me what you &apos;re going to do . &quot;
and I started <unk> .
and I said , &quot; We want to challenge injustice .
we wanted to help people who were convicted of <unk> .
we want to fight against prejudice and discrimination in institutional institutions .
it was a life @-@ saving system for children .
we wanted to do something about a death penalty system .
we want to reduce prisons .
we also want to stop <unk> of incarceration . &quot;
and I made a <unk> , and when I finished , she looked at me and she said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; It &apos;s going to get you tired , it &apos;s tiring . &quot;
and the <unk> came along , and she put her hand on my hand and she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;re brave . &quot;
I &apos;m sure the TED community needs to be more competent .
we need to find ways to address these challenges , these painful <unk> .
because ultimately , our whole humanity depends on each human being .
in my work .
and I learned something very simple .
and I started to understand , and I started to believe that each of us could not be defined by our worst side .
I believe , for everyone on this planet .
if he lied , he was a liar .
if he had something he didn &apos;t belong to , he was a <unk> .
even if you &apos;ve killed somebody , it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re a serial killer .
because I believe that human beings have fundamental dignity , law has to respect it .
I also believe that in many of our countries , there are , of course , even the opposite of the poorest of the world , not wealth .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I think the opposite of poverty in many , many places , is justice .
and finally , I believe that although it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s tempting to engage people , but we don &apos;t , in the end , will not be measured by technology , we will not be judged by wisdom and philosophy .
ultimately , people say that our society is not based on how we respond to the rich , how privileged people are , but based on how we treat the poor , the people who are <unk> .
because that &apos;s where we started to really understand who we were .
I would love to end with a story .
I work a lot .
it &apos;s like everybody .
sometimes these ideas are too large , and they don &apos;t get too seriously .
I used to justify these kids with a lot of money .
I went to see my <unk> , and I saw my research as adults .
and I started thinking , what exactly is it ?
a judge , how can a judge become a different person ?
the judge said he was adults , but I only saw one child .
and one night I woke up , and I was thinking , &quot; Oh my God , if the judge could write you another person , this judge must have magic . &quot;
by the way , Brian , the judge has magic .
you can &apos;t buy it .
because I was too late to sleep , my brain didn &apos;t know that I was starting a bill .
I was taught about 14 , a black child .
and I started doing his defense , and he said , &quot; <unk> : I &apos;m going to take my 14 @-@ year @-@ olds into a four @-@ year @-@ old , white company . &quot;
and in this initiative , I said , &quot; <unk> , the police station , the court , the court .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with the courts , or anything like that .
the next morning I woke up , and I was a dream , or did I really write this proposal ?
and the scary thing is , not just did I send it to the court .
and a few months went by , and forgot that .
and I decided , oh my gosh , I have to do this case .
I jumped in and felt nervous -- very nervous .
I drove to the court .
and I &apos;m thinking , this is going to be <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be painful .
and finally , I got out of the car , and I got to the court .
and as I stood on my way , there was this old black <unk> , the <unk> cleaning .
and he saw me running , and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; I &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; and he said , &quot; You , you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
and the <unk> came to me and hugged me .
and he whispered his ear in my ear .
he said , &quot; I &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
and I have to admit to you that this has given me a <unk> .
and he reminded me that I was deep in my self that I was reminded that each and every one of us should contribute to a better future .
so I went to the court .
I walked in , and the judge saw me .
&quot; Mr. <unk> , are you writing this ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; Yes , sir . that &apos;s what I wrote . &quot; we started arguing .
people came in , because everybody was upset .
I did write a lot of stuff .
and the police came in , and he went in , and he went in .
and I hadn &apos;t turned around , and the whole court was full of anger , because we were talking about race , and we were talking about poverty , and we were talking about poverty .
and I walked around the corner of the corner , and I was walking around .
and he would hear people complain about this .
and that &apos;s how he moved .
in the end , the black guy came in , and he was worried that he was sitting behind me and almost immediately <unk> .
and after 10 minutes , the judge suggested that .
during the break , one of the <unk> refused to get into the court .
this is a <unk> jump , and he <unk> the horse .
&quot; Jimmy , what are you doing in the court ? &quot;
this old black guy stood up and looked at this <unk> , and he said , &quot; I come in and I want to tell this young man to go ahead and see it better . &quot;
I &apos;ve come to TED today because I believe that a lot of people here understand that the moral <unk> of the world , although it &apos;s a long way away .
before we start to care about human rights and dignity , we can &apos;t really do it .
our survival and the survival of each individual has exploded .
our vision of technology and design has to do with the vision of entertainment and creativity , of philanthropy , of philanthropy .
and most of all , I just want to tell you , go ahead and see it , and look at it .
thank you .
you should be hearing about the audience , the community wants to help you , the willingness to make a contribution .
what can we do about that ?
Brian : there are many opportunities .
for example , if you live in California , there &apos;s a referendum in which we &apos;re going to be a big fan to <unk> the amount of money that we &apos;re spending on .
for example , in California , we &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars in the next five years -- 100 million .
at the same time , forty @-@ six percent of our violence had not been killed .
fifty percent of all the <unk> went through it .
this was an opportunity to change .
this was a poll that gave money to spend on law enforcement and on security .
and I think that &apos;s the opportunity .
Chris : there &apos;s a big drop in crime in the last three decades .
some people say that part of the reason for this is related to a lot of prison .
what would you say ?
Brian : almost nothing .
the rate of incarceration in this country is not in violent situations .
it &apos;s caused by the drug abuse .
and that &apos;s the main reason why our prisons live .
we were too far off <unk> .
and at the same time , we had three <unk> , so we could get people to live forever , just because they stole a bicycle , or a little bit of <unk> , and we didn &apos;t give them the opportunity to pay for the victim .
and I believe that we need more help from people who are committed to crimes than to deprive them .
I want to talk to you today about <unk> , who doesn &apos;t ?
and I think that one should change .
Brian , you &apos;re ready to help you out .
you &apos;re really excited about this guy .
thank you very much for coming to TED . thank you .
number four : after Bin Laden was killed , there was a big increase in terror .
two : Somalia appear in Somalia , <unk> : the police used pepper spray .
forty @-@ four : <unk> . <unk> : a thick <unk> .
six : seven , seven , seven , seven .
eight : a tsunami . <unk> : cyberattacks .
number two : drug wars , massive destruction , droughts .
there was a recession , a recession , a crisis , an Egyptian , Syria .
crisis , death , disasters .
Oh my gosh !
Peter Gabriel : so this is some of the video I &apos;ve collected in the last six months , if it &apos;s six days , or in the last six years , you can easily gather these kinds of clips .
the point is that the news media tend to teach us negative information , because our brains are particularly focused on this .
and of course , the brain does this very important reason .
and every moment , our sensors &quot; collect a lot of information , so that we don &apos;t process our brains .
and none of this information is ever more important than related to living information , and the first line of information is that the temporal lobe of the temporal lobe .
the brain <unk> are our early warning <unk> , our dangerous Geiger .
it <unk> all of the information and looks at it , looks at any threat in the environment .
so whenever we open the newspaper , we don &apos;t read all the negative information .
and the old one said in the newspaper , &quot; <unk> the headline . &quot; it was a real truth .
and now we have all kinds of digital devices , all the time , all the way to distribute all kinds of things . no wonder .
no wonder people think the world is backwards .
but it might be true .
not that way , the information that we receive was <unk> .
our society , in the course of centuries , has been increasing dramatically , and in fact , this speed has enabled us to create a rich world .
and I &apos;m not suggesting that these problems don &apos;t exist -- climate crisis , species extinct , water and energy shortage really do .
as humans , we &apos;re so good at making all kinds of predictions about the crisis , but we will eventually eliminate them .
let &apos;s look at what happened in the last century , to see where we &apos;re headed .
over the last hundred years , human life expectancy has increased two times more than two times , inflation have adjusted to inflation , and income per person in the world has tripled .
the baby mortality goes down 10 times .
food , electricity , transportation , communication costs down 10 to 1,000 times less .
Steve Jobs pointed out that we live in the most peaceful era of mankind .
and Charles <unk> said that the world went up from 25 to 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a great age .
and a lot of people forget that .
we kept expecting higher expectations .
in fact , we changed the concept of poverty .
if you think about it , most people in the United States today live under poverty have electricity , drinking water , toilets , telephone calls , air conditioning and cars .
the <unk> of the century , the most abundant <unk> on this planet , will never imagine a luxury of living .
and the foundation of all this is technology . it &apos;s a very recent exponential growth .
my good friend Ray <unk> showed that the tools of any given information are matched to the curve , Moore &apos;s Law , double the price performance per 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why you have a mobile phone call in your pocket that &apos;s 10,000 times cheaper than you have in the 1970s .
look at this curve .
this is Moore &apos;s Law from the last hundred years .
I want you to pay attention to the two things that the curved line is .
first , it &apos;s very smooth -- whether it &apos;s good or bad , whether it &apos;s war or peace , recession or growth .
that &apos;s because faster computers are used to create faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow down because of the enormous challenges we face .
even on the left @-@ hand side , it &apos;s still curved .
technology is accelerating its pace .
on this Moore &apos;s Law curve , it &apos;s a series of powerful technologies for all of us .
cloud computing , my friends at Autodesk called an infinite amount of computing ; sensors and networks ; 3D printing , allowing us to gain access to ubiquitous and personalized manufacturing worldwide ; synthetic life ; bringing new fuels , vaccines and food ; digital medicine .
how many people in the audience saw IBM Watson and Watson on the victory of the computer ?
that &apos;s great .
I looked at newspaper news stories , and I found it best .
and I like this : &quot; Watson <unk> the human race . &quot;
it &apos;s not an easy game .
the key is to understand the subtle details of the human language .
you can imagine the kind of artificial intelligence where all of the people who had active calls could be used .
four years ago at TED , Ray <unk> and I started a new university called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
we teach students about how to use these technologies to solve the enormous challenges that humanity faces .
every year we ask students to create a company or to create a product or to provide a service to a billion people &apos;s lives in a decade .
imagine a group of students could affect a billion people &apos;s lives today .
that sounds ridiculous , 30 years ago .
today we can list the companies that make this happen .
when I think about creating rich societies , it &apos;s not about creating luxury life for everyone on the planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
it was the resources that were once there .
technology is relative , and technology is a source of resources .
let me give you an example .
this is a story of Napoleon and <unk> in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the one on the left .
I was invited to dinner with my family .
and all of the soldiers who went to dinner were using gold plates .
but the king of Thailand uses aluminum <unk> .
aluminum used to be the most precious metal in the world , much more expensive than gold and <unk> .
that &apos;s why the <unk> top is aluminum .
even though aluminum is a <unk> of the Earth , it &apos;s not a form of metal .
it &apos;s a combination of oxygen and oxygen .
but then there &apos;s <unk> technology that makes the aluminum price so low that we can see it as one @-@ dimensional .
let &apos;s apply this metaphor to other things .
let &apos;s think about energy shortage .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that contains about 5,000 times as much energy per year as we were in .
forty @-@ 16 kilowatt @-@ hours of energy on the surface of the Earth .
the problem isn &apos;t energy ; it &apos;s accessible .
now there &apos;s a couple of good news .
this is the first time in India , where solar @-@ producing electricity costs down to half the cost of fossil fuels -- <unk> , 17 rupees .
last year , the cost of solar power was reduced by half .
last month , MIT announced a research report showing that by 2020 , the cost of solar power is 15 cents to six cents per kilowatt @-@ hour compared to the national average .
if we have enough energy , we have plenty of water .
so let &apos;s just throw in the water .
remember ? 1990 , the <unk> was going through Saturn , and the <unk> was facing the earth .
took a photo of a famous photo , what was called ?
&quot; dot com . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
70 percent of the Earth &apos;s surface is covered with water .
yes , two percent of the water is the iceberg , and we have hope for the world , but we still have hope .
there &apos;s a technology that &apos;s being committed to application , not 10 years from now , 20 years from now .
there &apos;s a nano @-@ technology .
this morning I spoke to a great DIY co @-@ inventors , Dean Kamen , and I &apos;d like to share with you -- I got his licensed technology -- he developed something called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which some of you may have heard about , it &apos;s a small fridge .
you can grow 1,000 liters of water every day -- water , pollution , water , water , water , water -- buy 1,000 liters , clean drinking water -- at least two cents a day .
the president of Coke &apos;s recent book has been shown in multiple developing countries as <unk> .
if it &apos;s successful , I &apos;m confident that it will be successful , Coke will be deployed around the world in a country .
and that &apos;s where technology has come from .
we see this in mobile phones .
my God , at the end of 2013 , the mobile phone in developing countries will reach 70 percent .
think about it . in the middle of Kenya , a soldier has better motion than a 25 years ago .
if they visit Google with their smartphone , they get more knowledge and information about 15 years ago than President Clinton .
they live in a world where information and communications can &apos;t be predicted .
and better yet , we &apos;ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars -- GPS , television and <unk> , and medical diagnostic technologies -- not <unk> in your act .
the best part of this is probably medicine .
and last month I had the privilege of meeting with the <unk> Foundation to get 1,000 million dollars in mobile hands .
we challenge the team around the world to bring these technologies together in mobile devices , and you can talk to it , because it has artificial intelligence , and it &apos;s coughing up , or <unk> .
to win the competition , the device needs to give you better diagnosis than a group of physicians who have been approved .
imagine this app where there &apos;s only 1.3 percent of the developing world population .
if this device was ever sequenced , it would not recognize , it would call the control center of the disease , the first disease would prevent a pandemic .
we also have the most rich world .
I call it the One billion people . &quot;
that white line is the population .
more than seven billion people on Earth today .
and by the way , the best way to prevent the explosion of population growth is to get more education around the world .
in 2010 , we had about two billion people connected to the Internet .
by 2020 , the Internet user will grow from two to five billion .
three billion people are not aware of new users , are going to be involved in this global conversation .
what do they want ?
what would they consume ? what would their wish be ?
what we &apos;re going to see is the largest economy of energy , not a recession .
these are the people who represent hundreds of billion dollars , and they &apos;re going to put into the global economy .
they &apos;re going to get better , because they &apos;re going to use an <unk> device , and they &apos;re going to get smarter , and they &apos;re going to get more productive than they &apos;ve ever been for any time .
three billion dollars of health , education , productive people in our society could bring to us ?
a series of <unk> that we never had before .
and it &apos;s given to people who are suffering , or other difficult , to get their first chance of caring and help .
what does that leave us with ?
maybe we haven &apos;t seen anything yet .
and one of the things that I &apos;ve learned in the course of winning X @-@ ray is that the goal is clear , the passionate team can achieve extraordinary success , the things that we can do in the last few companies and governments .
let me just end by sharing a story , and it &apos;s exciting to me .
some of you may have heard about this project .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it came from the University of Seattle .
it &apos;s a way to get individual through a sequence of amino acids and analyze how the proteins are folded .
and the way it folds determine the structure and function of the amino acids .
it &apos;s a very important medical research .
and it wasn &apos;t until now that it was a problem solved by super @-@ computers .
this is a game that originally gave university professors .
and then hundreds and hundreds of people will play the game .
it also shows that human @-@ pattern recognition is still beyond the best computers .
when you synthesize the best folding experts , it &apos;s not a professor at MIT , it &apos;s not a student at MIT , it &apos;s a British woman from Manchester University , who came to work in a hospital during a recovery , and at night , it &apos;s the best proteins in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gave me enormous confidence in the future , is that each of us , as individuals , has been challenged by the challenges of the world .
we have fast @-@ forward technologies and tools .
you have a passion for DIY inventors .
you all have the power to be a technological philanthropist .
and there &apos;s 30 million people coming to the line , working with us on a huge challenge , doing what we have to do .
we &apos;re going to have a few decades .
thank you .
I felt that in today &apos;s medical culture , there had to start changing .
and this change can start with a doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and maybe because I &apos;ve been in medicine for many years , I can give up some of the best things to start with .
let &apos;s start by talking about baseball .
why not ?
and the routine was over , and the world baseball bat was about to start .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
the baseball world is full of thousands of people .
let &apos;s take data from the data .
the movie &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is about data , and how to build a great team based on the data .
I want to tell you about a data I want you to hear about .
it &apos;s called a bat rate .
when we were talking about a bat with a swing of the bat .
we mean the players &apos; fight was very stable , and every 10 times you get three games .
and <unk> meant that the <unk> were hit and put into the garbage cans , and it wasn &apos;t going to get killed immediately , and the ball wasn &apos;t going to get transmitted back to the front .
there are three out of 10 .
do you know how the baseball season talks about the <unk> players ?
great , great , stars play great .
and you know how they called a bat number 40 .
is it the four players who hit each 10 ?
it &apos;s a legacy -- like Ted Williams -- he &apos;s a baseball player in baseball -- and the last player in baseball has over 40 percent of the bat &apos;s hit .
now let &apos;s go back to my world -- medical field , which I &apos;m familiar with , but what I &apos;m going to talk about is something that bothers me .
imagine you had to get a peanut , and then you were recommended to give a surgeon in the middle of an operation with four percent <unk> .
it sounds strange , right ?
and if you live in a very remote area , two of the coronary arteries that you love have stayed <unk> , and you recommended her <unk> to a neurologist who has <unk> rates on a blood vessel .
but wait , wait , you know ?
she had a huge increase in performance this year , and her level was recovered .
her hit &quot; hit &quot; hit &quot; hit 5 .
but it &apos;s not acceptable .
and I want to ask you a question .
you think , what if a cardiologist , a professional care surgeon , or a professional manager , is a surgeon , or a <unk> , &quot; How should it be ? &quot;
<unk> ? very good .
in fact , no one in the medical community knows what a good surgeon or an emergency manager should have .
we put them all , including myself , putting them in a professional class and told them to be perfect .
absolute , absolutely impossible to make false diagnosis -- but we let them think about the details , about how to do that .
that &apos;s what I got at medical school .
I &apos;m a student who has an evolutionary tendency .
at school , there was a student who once said that Brian was going to review it as a blood test .
and I did .
I was out of a small <unk> in Toronto , and I finished a little <unk> in my apartment , and finished my studies .
I had everything .
and I took every piece of the anatomy , every piece of the muscle , the way it expanded , each of which had stretched out of the artery from the aorta , and everything that was known or common .
I even knew how to determine the <unk> of different diagnosis .
and during that time , I accumulate more and more knowledge .
I did a good job , and I graduated with the grade .
when I came out of medical school , I felt like I had just gotten everything -- or close @-@ up of @-@ the @-@ stage -- and almost everything I &apos;d made , it would be very , very difficult .
and I didn &apos;t get it wrong in a period of time , until I met seven women .
when women were brought into an emergency room at a school in Toronto , I was working as an emergency room .
and I was appointed a cardiac cardiac procedure , and appointed .
and my job was , when the emergency person needed to have a full @-@ spectrum of specialists on the heart , in the middle of nowhere .
and then I went back to my report on my return .
and when I met a woman named <unk> , she had a very thin breath .
I heard her breath when I spoke to her .
and when I listened to her chest , I heard it from both sides of her chest , and told me that it was an <unk> heart failure .
this is because of heart failure , where you can &apos;t get all the blood out , and that part of the blood comes back into the lung , and it &apos;s filled with blood , and it can cause breathing .
it &apos;s not a difficult diagnostic .
and after I made the diagnosis , I started to help her .
I gave her the aspirin , and I gave her some medicine that would <unk> her heart .
and I gave her some <unk> , <unk> , to help her take the extra water out .
in the next two or three hours , she started getting better .
and I was happy .
and that &apos;s when I made the first mistake : I made her home .
and by the way , I made two mistakes .
and I was reporting back to her home before my due report .
I didn &apos;t do what I was supposed to do , pick up the phone call and give him a look at the case , give him an opportunity to meet this patient .
I knew her , so I could give her more detailed data .
maybe there &apos;s reason for that .
maybe I don &apos;t want to be the first person to always guide .
maybe a patient can communicate with me without having to communicate with my ex @-@ patient .
the second error I made was even more serious .
when I got her home , I ignored a small voice in my heart , and the voice tried to tell me , &quot; Don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , I was so confident that I didn &apos;t even consult the nurses about to take care of her , &quot; Do you think she &apos;s going to go home ? &quot;
the nurse thought , and he said , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t think there &apos;s any problem . &quot;
and it seemed to me that this was happening yesterday .
I signed up at the hospital , an ambulance company sent her home .
and I went back to work in my clinic .
and on the other day , that afternoon , my gut had a sense of <unk> .
but I still work .
and at the end of the job , I went out of the hospital , and as I walked into the parking lot , I did something that I couldn &apos;t do normally .
I borrowed from the emergency room .
and there was another nurse , not the other woman who took care of a woman , who told me that most of the doctors were afraid to hear three words .
other doctors were also frightened of the three words , but because the people who looked at the patient had a lot of meaning for us .
these three words : remember ?
&quot; remember ? you send it home ? &quot;
the nurse asked .
&quot; she came back . &quot; she used the usual tone .
she did come back .
it &apos;s been dying since coming back .
and after I got her home about an hour later , she was on the ground , and her family beat her back to the emergency room , and she had a big shock , and her blood pressure was 50 .
her breath was incredibly faint , <unk> .
the crowd was shocked .
they gave her increased blood pressure .
and she connected her <unk> .
and I was shocked . I was terrified .
and then I was feeling a little bit like a <unk> , because when they <unk> her condition , they put her in a <unk> ward , and I wanted her to wake up in despair .
but in the next two or three days , she never woke up again .
her brain had been torn apart .
her family came together .
and in the following words , they slowly accepted it .
at the end of the season , they chose her to leave the person -- her mother , her family , her mother , her grandmother .
some people say you never forget the names of the dead people you &apos;ve had .
and that was the first time I realized that .
in the next couple of weeks , I was so frustrated , and had the first time that I had a dangerous sense of being in a medical culture -- I felt lonely . it wasn &apos;t a sense of being healthy , because you couldn &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
it &apos;s that -- when you &apos;ve <unk> your commitment to your friends , to say that to be conservative , and you know that , after you &apos;ve met your best friend who you &apos;re fighting , you &apos;re arguing with , but that guilt is still dominant , and I &apos;m not going to tell you the same thing .
and then you made a <unk> commitment , and you would never be able to take a <unk> .
it was a shame that was taught .
and the kind of non @-@ toxic shame that I &apos;ve been talking about will allow you to get into your head .
it would say to you , not what you &apos;re doing , but you &apos;re not bad guys .
and that was my feeling .
and that &apos;s not because of my <unk> ; others are pretty good .
and he talked to that family , and I was sure he beat me up for making sure that I hadn &apos;t been accused of doing anything .
but I kept asking myself questions .
why didn &apos;t I have my voice ? why did I get her home ?
and when I was even more depressed , I said , &quot; Why do I make such dumb errors ? &quot;
why do I go to medical medicine ?
and slowly , slowly steady , that feeling began to <unk> .
and I started to feel <unk> .
and then in a sunny day , when I saw a flash of light , I felt , maybe I could feel good again .
and then I did an appointment with myself : if I could do perfect , I could not make mistakes , and I would let that kick out .
that voice did stop .
I went back to work .
but it happened .
two years later , when I was in a hospital in Toronto , a community in a neighborhood in Toronto , I saw a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man who had lost his throat .
the clinic was busy , so I was a bit quick .
and he pointed to here .
and I looked at it . his throat was kind of <unk> .
I left him with a prescription for penicillin .
even as he walked out of the door of the clinic , he seemed to be pointing at his throat .
two days later , I was on the emergency room , and my director was going to go to her office and talk about private .
and she said those three words : remember ?
&quot; remember ? who have you seen the throat of the throat ? &quot;
he didn &apos;t have any sexual activity .
it has to be something that could threaten life with something called <unk> .
you can look at Google , but it &apos;s not the throat , it &apos;s an infection of <unk> , and it could cause respiratory <unk> .
luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
and after a few days of <unk> antibiotic science , he was cured .
and I went back to that moment of guilt and regret , and then I took a step back to work , and then went back to work , and then it happened again .
at the same time , I found myself in the same patient .
it &apos;s hard to imagine what happens , especially when you work in a hospital where you work at night .
and although for those two cases , I didn &apos;t get them home , I didn &apos;t feel like I was in any way that I was taking care of .
one of them I diagnosed with is <unk> .
and he set up an X @-@ ray , but it turned out to be normal . and my colleagues were doing <unk> on the patient &apos;s case , and he noticed that there were some soft places on the right @-@ hand side of the patient .
another patient has severe diarrhea .
I gave him some liquid to help him add water , and brought it back to my colleagues .
he did it . and when he noticed that the patient was kind of soft and soft , it connected to the surgeons .
both of these patients did surgery and recovered .
but whenever I think of those two cases , it &apos;s going to hurt me .
and I also hope that I can tell you that the worst mistake that I made was only five years ago when I started medicine , like many of my colleagues said it , but it was completely random .
in the last five years , I &apos;ve made some mistakes .
I still felt lonely , shame .
but the crux of the problem is , if I can &apos;t explain and talk about the wrong mistakes I &apos;ve made , if I can &apos;t find the right voice to tell me the bad source , how can I share my experiences with my colleagues ?
how do I teach them that they no longer repeat my mistakes ?
and when I walk into a situation -- like now , I don &apos;t know how you think about me .
when did you hear about people talking about their own failure over and over again ?
yes , if you go to a party , you may hear some mistakes about other doctors , but you don &apos;t hear somebody talk about being wrong .
and if I walk into a room right now , one of my colleagues , asking them to help and begin to tell them what I told you about earlier , maybe even before I even tell you about two stories , they begin to feel very uncomfortable , and they start to tell a joke , and then they change the topic .
in fact , if I were , or my colleague , I knew that one of my colleagues in the hospital had broken his legs , and I believed , when I met him , I couldn &apos;t mix him with normal eyes .
that &apos;s the kind of system we have .
an absolute denial system .
there are only two people in this system -- mistakes of being wrong , that can suffer from sleep deprivation and those bad outcomes with bad outcomes .
it &apos;s almost like the self @-@ response of the immune system , where the antibodies normally start to attack the different people .
we have an idea that when we blow out all the people who make mistakes , we get a safe system .
but that idea raises two questions .
in my first paper on <unk> radio and news , from my first article in Toronto , I wrote to my show , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which I myself personally studied everything I could access to .
and what I &apos;ve learned is that mistakes are everywhere .
we work in a system where we get errors every day , and the hospital has a 10 percent chance to give a bad dose or give it to a bad dose , and the cases that get infected in the hospital are increasing , and they have unnecessary harm and death .
in this country , almost two and a half million people die of preventable medical mistakes .
in the United States , according to the Institute of Medicine , there were 10 million people .
and even so , both of these pieces have been a little bit underestimated , because we never looked at the problem as we should .
the point is that .
in a hospital where knowledge has doubled in two to three years , we can &apos;t grow the numbers .
sleep deprivation is absolutely universal .
and we can &apos;t get away from that .
our own intuition biases , our own intuition , our conclusions -- for example , I could record the perfect for a patient .
but if the same patient with the same ease with the same <unk> , with breathing a bit of alcohol , I would write down a little bit of <unk> .
and this one was completely different .
I &apos;m not a robot . I don &apos;t do the same thing every time .
my patients are not cars , and they &apos;re not going to describe their symptoms every time .
so it &apos;s inevitable .
and if the system was taught to me that it would be possible to tap into all the available medical professionals , there would be no staff .
it &apos;s about people who don &apos;t want to talk about the worst mistakes they &apos;ve ever made .
in my show , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which I &apos;ve said , &quot; <unk> : &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; and I would say to everybody who comes from emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency emergency room , &quot; This is my worst mistake . &quot; and I would hand them , &quot; You know , what ? &quot;
their pupils dilate , they <unk> , they look at the ground , <unk> and start telling me their story .
they want to tell their stories , and they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; Look , it &apos;s as wrong as me . &quot;
they just need a moment to tell the story .
what they need is a re @-@ <unk> culture .
start with a single individual doctor .
the doctors who define them as humans , who understand that she is man , and accept the fact that she is not <unk> , but who can learn from them and learn from them .
she shared her experience with other people .
and they were supportive when others were talking about the sin .
she doesn &apos;t have a sense of <unk> , but it &apos;s only a way to get everyone out of the benefits , the way to point out the mistakes of others .
and the medical culture of her work acknowledged that the entire system was run by one person , and when one person ran a system , it was sometimes <unk> .
and the system can evolve over and over again , and it can make it easier for people to see the wrong things that we can &apos;t avoid , but at the same time , we can grow an environment of care , encourage everyone in our medical care system to point out the potential mistakes that some of us might be wrong when we &apos;re looking at them .
I &apos;m Brian <unk> .
I &apos;m a physician who <unk> his definition .
I &apos;m a human . I make mistakes .
I &apos;m sorry for that , but I &apos;m going to try and learn how to do it .
I still don &apos;t know how you think about me , but I think I can .
and finally , let me do it with three words : I remember .
in the 1980s , if you had a typewriter , you had to sign the government .
you had to be registered by the phrase of the typewriter .
in this case , the government can follow where the text came from .
and if they find a single page on the wrong point , they can follow that view .
and in the West , we can &apos;t understand how someone can do this , how free speech can be .
we will never do that in our own country .
but today , 2011 , if you buy a page from any of the large <unk> manufacturer , a page , a page of paper , and then a piece of paper , on every page of the page , makes it unique to you and your printer .
this is what happens to us today .
it seemed like no one was doing it .
this is an example of our government using technology to deal with our citizens .
this is one of three major sources of the Internet .
if we look at what happens in online societies , we identify with the attacker of the United States .
we have three major groups .
we have online criminals .
here , we have a gentleman named Ellen <unk> from Ukraine .
online criminals are easily understood .
these guys were making money .
they make a lot of money online attacks , lots and lots of money .
we actually had several cases of <unk> , <unk> , all made by online attacks .
and here comes <unk> from Estonia .
this is Alfred <unk> .
this is Stephen Hawking .
this is <unk> <unk> .
this is Matthew Anderson , a brass pen , etc .
these people were making a lot of money online , but they were making illegal money by using bank services like <unk> from our accounts when we were on the Internet , or using <unk> information to gather our credit card information when we were infected with an infected computer .
the United States , two months ago , froze Mr. <unk> &apos;s bank accounts at the Swiss bank account when there were <unk> million dollars .
Mr. <unk> himself remained alone ; nobody knew where he was .
today I would argue that any of us in this room might be the victim of online crime , the victim of the real world .
and it &apos;s obviously getting worse .
in the future , most of the crime will come online .
the second group of attacks that we see today are not due to money .
and their motivation came from other places -- because of protest , for <unk> , for ridiculed .
these anonymous groups were actively active in the last 12 months and turned into the key participants in online attacks .
these are the key players : for crimes , anonymous attacks to protest , and the last group was ethnic , and the government was attacking .
let &apos;s take an example of what happened by <unk> .
this is a typical example of government attacks against its own citizens .
<unk> is a authority in Holland , or it used to be .
it had collapsed last fall because they were hacked .
some people shredded it completely .
and I asked a meeting last week in a meeting with a group of people , and I asked him if a leader could find somebody who was dying because of a <unk> attack .
and his answer was yes .
so , how do people die for such an attack ?
<unk> is an authority certificate .
they sell certificate .
what do you do with your certificate ?
you need a certificate , which is that you have a website that has <unk> , encryption services like <unk> .
today , all of us , or most of us , use <unk> or any one of our opponents , have services that are particularly popular in the <unk> of Iran , Iran @-@ based services like foreign services , because they know that these are more reliable than local services , that they are able to look at their eyes , so they can &apos;t discuss their discussion .
they could also , if they attacked a foreign authority .
<unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of <unk> .
what happens in the Arab region , like in Egypt ?
in Egypt , the riots had <unk> the headquarters for the Egyptian government , in April of 2011 , they found a lot of documents .
in these documents , there was a marker called <unk> .
some of the notes came from a German company where they sold a set of tools for the Egyptian government to take -- a large part of the country &apos;s communications .
they sold this tool to the Egyptian government as 28 Euros .
the headquarters for the company are right there .
so the Western government is bringing power to governments to fight their own citizens .
but the Western government also did it for themselves .
for example , in Germany , a few weeks ago , there was a government named <unk> , and the government of Germany was asked to survey their own citizens .
if you &apos;re a <unk> to vote , it &apos;s clear that your eye has been heard .
but today , things are way beyond .
they &apos;re going to be watching your Internet .
they &apos;re going to use tools like <unk> to infect your computer so they can monitor all of your communications , listen to your online discussion , gather your password .
and when we think about it a little bit deeper , people respond to things like , &quot; Yeah , it sounds bad , but because I &apos;m a legitimate citizen , I don &apos;t really have a effect on me .
why should I worry ?
I don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
that &apos;s where the argument is , there &apos;s no reason .
privacy is an authentic assessment .
privacy doesn &apos;t have to talk .
it &apos;s not a question of security .
it &apos;s a question of freedom control .
we will trust our government in 2011 , and we will lose any power .
will we trust the future government , blindly trusting , a government after 50 years ?
these are the questions that we worry about for the next 50 years .
it sounds a little bit strange ; I am an <unk> nut .
the first one was built in <unk> , which was a very simple idea : you put cement on a fixed scale .
fast @-@ forward to being the most dominant building in the world .
it enables us to make things more than ourselves , buildings , bridges , bridge , so that we can make a bridge .
the actual Lego blocks have become essentially the Lego blocks of our age .
in &apos; 96 , Lego brought this .
they were called self @-@ assembly .
and within a few years , the Lego companies occupied every family .
it &apos;s been estimated that there are more than four billion blocks of Lego -- or 75 billion dollars worldwide .
you don &apos;t need to be an engineer to build beautiful homes , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
the Lego is possible .
the Lego essentially is to take the Lego blocks , the real @-@ world Lego , the building blocks that we imagine .
in the same year , at the same time , a new revolution is going to launch , the next generation of bricks .
transistors are a small plastic component that will take us from a static building to a new world where everything can interact .
you can use it as a transistor transistors , and you can create larger , more complicated circuits .
but there &apos;s a major difference : only experts can play transistors .
I personally couldn &apos;t believe that the Lego blocks of our age are experts , so I decided to change it .
eight years ago , when I was at the Media Lab , I started thinking about how you could empower the engineers and the designers .
a few years ago , I started developing <unk> .
I &apos;ll show you how it works .
<unk> are modules that have a specific function of each of them .
they all set in advance as light , motors , sensors .
and best of all , they &apos;re built together with magnets .
so it &apos;s impossible to assemble .
the bits are separated by color .
green is the output , the blue is the power , and the pink is the orange one .
so what you need to do is you take the blue and you get it green and you start building larger circuits .
you take the blue and you get a green light .
you can put a dial in the middle and you can make a little <unk> .
and when you remove them , you get a pulse pattern , and you &apos;re now creating a little light .
add that up to the point where you create a noise machine .
I had to go .
in addition to that , it &apos;s actually very powerful .
you don &apos;t need programming , you have <unk> , you have <unk> , you can program it with simple intuition .
so for example , if you &apos;re going to shine a little bit , you just need to spin the button and actually make it faster or slower .
the idea behind the scenes is that this is a database of growth .
we wanted to take every single person in the world and make a kit out of them .
the light , the solar panels , the motors -- everything should be <unk> .
we used to teach our kids to play them .
that was an incredible experience .
and best of all , they started to understand the appliances that they couldn &apos;t do in their daily lives .
so , for example , how <unk> work , or why the <unk> can go on , or the iPod can react to that .
we also used to bring design to design schools .
for example , we used to have designers who had no experience whatsoever to begin with materials from scratch .
as you can see , it &apos;s created with <unk> and paper .
a couple of weeks ago , we took <unk> to Rhode Island School of Design to give it to designers who were completely engineered , and we gave it to some cardboard , wood and paper -- and we said , &quot; Do something . &quot;
and this is a project they &apos;ve done , and it &apos;s a feedback loop on the feedback loop .
and so on , this is actually one of my favorites .
it &apos;s a play @-@ dough that &apos;s pretty annoying .
and for those of you who are a tech technician , they become another material , and electrons are just a material .
and we wanted to make it available for everyone .
so open source is open source .
you can go to the website , download all of the design files , make it yourself .
we want to encourage a world where people are the inventors , the inventors , the <unk> , the world that we live in , the world of interaction , belongs to each other .
don &apos;t get upset , start your invention .
thank you .
when I was 11 years old , I remember waking up one morning and hearing a pleasant voice at home .
my father was listening to the BBC in his gray radio .
and he couldn &apos;t see it , because most of the news would cause him to suffer .
&quot; the Taliban are gone ! &quot; the father is screaming .
I don &apos;t know what that means , but I can see that my father is very happy .
&quot; you can now go to a real school . &quot; he said .
I will never forget that morning .
a real school .
when I was six years old , the Taliban took over Afghanistan and said that girls were illegal .
so in the next five years , I went to a secret school with my sister and I was never allowed to go out alone .
this is the only education we have .
we &apos;re going to walk every day so that no one of us wonder where we are .
we put books on food <unk> so people think we &apos;re shopping .
we had 100 people locked up in a small living room .
it &apos;s comfortable in the winter , but it &apos;s freezing in summer .
we all know that we know that we &apos;re at risk of life , teachers , students , parents .
and sometimes the schools are suspended from the Taliban for a week .
we &apos;re always worried about being discovered by the Taliban .
are we being tracked ?
do they know our place ?
we were scared , but we still wanted to go to school .
I was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that valued my daughter .
my grandfather was a remarkable man in his age .
he was born in Afghanistan , and he had different perceptions of other people , and he insisted that his daughter , my mother , to school , and so forced him to cut off the door .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
that &apos;s her .
she retired two years ago , and she turned my house into a school , girls and women in the community .
my father -- that &apos;s him -- he &apos;s the first person in his family ever had education .
so no doubt , his child should be educated , including his daughter , who has the Taliban , despite the risks .
for him , the child is less likely to be educated .
in the Taliban controlled Afghanistan for those years , I remember that sometimes I would always be frightened of my own life , invisible to the future .
I wanted to give up , but my father would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you may lose anything in your life .
your money could be stolen , you could be <unk> by the war .
and the only thing you can live with is , if we have to pay for your education , we will be free .
do you want to continue ? &quot;
now I &apos;m 22 .
the country I grew up surrounded by several decades of war .
I had this age of women , and I had less than six percent of my high school students , and I would be like most of them .
now I &apos;m a proud college student .
one of the top <unk> <unk> of the United States , was put together in <unk> , 2012 , when I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the daughter of the daughter , was pulled out , and showed me first .
he was proud of not just my college education , but also because in women , I was the first , in women &apos;s lives , and I was the first person to drive him around the streets of Kabul .
my family trusted me .
my dreams are large , but they expect me to be even higher .
and that &apos;s why I became the global ambassador , a global organization for women &apos;s education .
and that &apos;s why I got involved in a new initiative , and this was the first , probably the only <unk> in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , girls were still very dangerous .
what excites me about this is that I see students in my school can take chances .
I saw their parents &apos; parents , and especially their fathers , like my father , who supported them , although they saw fear from their faces .
for example , he wasn &apos;t a real name , and I couldn &apos;t let you see his face , and he was my father .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter , on the way to school , killed the bombs .
and he got home , and the phone rings , a voice warning him , if he got his daughter to school , it would happen again .
&quot; if you think , now you can kill me . &quot; and he said , &quot; But I &apos;m not going to destroy my daughter &apos;s future . &quot;
and for Afghanistan , I realized -- and this is something that no longer has been realized in the West -- that behind our success , it &apos;s a father -- he can recognize his own daughter , his daughter &apos;s value , his own success .
it &apos;s not that mothers aren &apos;t important for our success .
in fact , for the future of daughter &apos;s daughter , they were the first ones and the most compelling <unk> , but in a society like Afghanistan , we have to have men .
in the Taliban controlled , there were only a couple of hundred girls -- please don &apos;t forget , it was illegal .
but today , the girls in Afghanistan are over three million .
Afghanistan is very different from the United States .
I found that Americans can see the fragility of our change .
I was worried how long it would last in the U.S.
but when I went back to Afghanistan and saw my students and my parents supportive of their parents , I saw hope for the future , and I saw this change .
for me , Afghanistan is full of hope and infinite possibilities , and every single day when girls who read books are reminded of me .
like me , they have great dreams .
thank you .
everything I &apos;ve done , whether it &apos;s my whole life or work on my entire life -- was directly influenced by the circumstances of my youth when she was young .
from 1971 , I looked very young , but actually I was -- I was in Zambia , Kenya , Algeria , Somalia , Somalia , Kenya , and Africa was involved in projects like Africa .
I was working in a non @-@ governmental organization , and every project that we built in Africa failed .
I was panic .
when I was 21 years old , I felt that we were Italian and we were doing good for Africa .
and yet , what are we doing ?
our first project gave me the inspiration of the first book , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; and in this case , Italians decided to teach <unk> .
so , we took the seeds from Italy to the south of Zambia , a spectacular valley to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south , to the south .
and of course , the local people were not interested in this , so we paid them for the job , and they weren &apos;t there for a moment .
we were so surprised by the valley where the people were not farming .
but we didn &apos;t ask them for the reasons , and just the <unk> said , &quot; We &apos;ve come . &quot;
&quot; help out the front lines when the dead people are hungry . &quot;
and of course , everything in Africa looks pretty good .
our tomato , our beautiful tomato , was so big in Italy , a tomato , a tomato , a tomato , was able to grow that big .
it &apos;s unbelievable . we said to the people in Zambia , &quot; Look , how easy it is . &quot;
and when the tomatoes were growing up , the look @-@ alike of the grass , and all the <unk> from the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , all the tomato .
and we said , &quot; Oh my gosh , these damn <unk> ! &quot;
and Zambia said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we are not here . &quot;
&quot; why haven &apos;t you ever asked ? &quot;
I thought we were Italian and we were failing in Africa , but when I knew what the Americans were , the British were , and the French were doing what they did , I was very proud of our project in Zambia .
because we fed the <unk> at least .
you should look at the garbage -- you should see how much rubbish we put in Africa .
you can read the book , &quot; <unk> aid , &quot; and the author is Dan <unk> , an orthopedic economist .
this book was published in 2009 .
we &apos;ve spent two trillion dollars on African continent over the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you about the damage that money has made .
you read it yourself .
let &apos;s take a look at how big the damage we have in Africa .
we are Western <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and there are only two ways that we deal with people : one , two , three parents .
these two words come from a Latin word , &quot; meaning &quot; father . &quot;
but two words mean different .
parents love to say that I treat different cultures as my child . &quot;
and what <unk> meant was that I looked at other cultures as my servant .
that &apos;s why white people in Africa are called <unk> , which is the boss .
when I was in a book , &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is the author , &quot; he said , &quot; The most important thing for economic development is that if people don &apos;t want help , they go .
this should be the primary principles of aid .
the primary principle of aid is respect .
this morning , Mr. <unk> , put a stick on the ground and said , &quot; Can we -- can you imagine a city that &apos;s not invaded ? &quot;
when I was 27 years old , I made a decision , based on the need for people , and I started a work system called <unk> , and we didn &apos;t do it , we didn &apos;t motivate anybody , but we found better places for local businesses .
so what we &apos;re going to do is shut up .
we walked into a community and we weren &apos;t supposed to impose any ideas on each other , but we were sitting with the people .
our workplaces were not at the office .
we met with our clients in restaurants and bars .
we don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
what we do is we make friends with them , and we discover their interest and purpose .
the most important thing is passion .
you can ask your ideas to your clients .
but what if they &apos;re not interested ?
the client was obsessed with making up this passion was the most important .
the passion for each other is to build on the basis of self @-@ improvement , which is the most important .
and then we were able to help them collect the knowledge and information , because it &apos;s the world , it &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> .
people who have ideas don &apos;t necessarily know anything , but we can support them .
so many years ago , I had an idea that we couldn &apos;t have at least one of them , not to impose our ideas on them ?
I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
there &apos;s a problem with community meetings .
the entrepreneurs never go to school , they never tell you where they &apos;re going to spend money , they &apos;re going to spend it .
so there &apos;s a proposal for that .
you don &apos;t even have the smartest people in your community because they &apos;re not participating in your public gathering .
what we did was , we had to build a social infrastructure for one @-@ to @-@ one .
we have to create a new career .
it &apos;s a professional equivalent of corporate <unk> , and it &apos;s a business that will face @-@ to @-@ face with your household in your kitchen , your kitchen kitchen table , or your cafe , to help you out the window to transform your entrepreneurial passion for a living .
I did an experiment in <unk> , Iowa .
and I was a Ph.D. , and I was trying to get rid of that , and then I was alone .
my first year at <unk> , just a walk out of the street , and in those days , I had the first client , and I helped this first person . he was a <unk> , and he was in a garage , and I was able to sell the fish for him , and then the local fishermen were saying , &quot; Can you ? &quot;
I got these five fishermen to work , not to get the nice tuna to sell them at 60 cents at low cost , but to sell them at a 15 @-@ dollar high to Japan , and then the farmer ran to me and said , &quot; Hey , can you help them ? &quot;
within a year , I did 27 projects , and the government ran to me and said , &quot; What do you do ?
how can you -- &quot; I said , &quot; I did something very difficult .
that &apos;s the wind , listen to them . &quot;
so -- So the government said , &quot; That &apos;s it . &quot;
we &apos;ve started this project in 300 communities around the world .
we have helped to build 40,000 companies .
the next generation of entrepreneurs suffer from nothing .
Peter Gabriel , one of the great <unk> of our history , died a few years ago , 96 .
Peter Gabriel : before he went to business as a philosophical professor , Peter <unk> once said , &quot; The plan is inherently <unk> and business . &quot;
the plan was to give the entrepreneurial help .
now , we rebuild the <unk> , but we don &apos;t know how many of the smartest people want to use their own money and their energy .
we have to learn how to give these people their opinions .
we have to give them permission , and respect their privacy , and we have to be good at providing them to help , so that they come to the door , and that &apos;s it .
in a community of 100,000 people , we have 200 customers .
can you imagine a community of about 4,000 people , <unk> all the intelligence and passion ?
who &apos;s the biggest talk you &apos;ve ever given ?
entrepreneurial people . you clap for them .
so what I want to say is that pioneering spirit is the dynamic of today .
when we were at the end of the industrial revolution -- we were able to grow fossil fuels , and manufacturing -- but we suddenly realized that this was sustainable .
the internal combustion engine used to run out of fuel .
it &apos;s not sustainable food .
what we &apos;re going to care about now is how we meet it in a sustainable way to meet seven billion people , health , education , communications and communications .
there &apos;s no technology at all .
who could invent this kind of technology to do the green revolution ?
government ? don &apos;t you ?
entrepreneurs are people who are struggling with it .
many years ago , I saw an interesting article in a magazine called <unk> .
there were a group of experts invited to talk about the future of New York .
and that &apos;s when people come together in those early years , and they &apos;ve made a statement about 100 years later in New York City , and their conclusions are : 100 years later , the city will disappear .
why ? because they looked at the chart and said , if the population continues to grow at this rate , the people in New York are going to need six million horses , and six million <unk> are going to fail .
and then people would be flooded .
so they &apos;re talking about this dirty technology that &apos;s going to kill life in New York .
so what happened ? 40 years later , in 1900 , there was one , <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s a new kind of technology that &apos;s going to evolve , and there &apos;s a lot of flat @-@ lined .
the Ford Motor Company in Michigan , for example , was the Ford Motor Company in Michigan .
however , there &apos;s a secret to the entrepreneurs .
first of all , you have to <unk> their commitment .
they wouldn &apos;t come and talk to you .
and then you have to offer them a passion for commitment .
you have to tell them what entrepreneurship is .
whether it &apos;s a large company or a small company , there &apos;s three things that you can do to make a good job with marketing , a good job of marketing , a good idea .
what &apos;s the problem ?
no one in the world has ever been able to make and sell and sell at the same time .
this person doesn &apos;t exist .
people like this are not born yet .
we did surveys , and we looked at 100 skilled companies in the world -- Carnegie training companies , Edison , the Ford Motor Company , and all of these companies , <unk> , Yahoo , <unk> , Yahoo .
all of the successful businesses in the world have one thing in common : none of them are created by one person .
now we teach them about 16 @-@ year @-@ olds in <unk> , and we started to take Richard Branson and show them how many words we had before .
&quot; I didn &apos;t do it once . &quot; we did it 32 times .
he wasn &apos;t alone at the beginning .
nobody could start a business alone . nobody .
so we can build a community , in this community , where we have expertise from small businesses , local <unk> that can be used for you , <unk> , <unk> , and we can offer you the help of this ambition , we can ask you , &quot; What do you need ? &quot;
can you do anything ? can you make it ?
can you sell it ? can you run the money ? &quot;
&quot; ah , I can &apos;t do that . &quot; does it mean that I will help you ? &quot;
we inspire local communities to do business .
we have volunteers who help to pool their entrepreneurial resources and their human resources , and what we find is that local people can create miracles that can change the culture and the economy of the community , as long as you can take this passion , this energy , this energy .
thank you .
about five years ago , I had an experience of what Alice was doing .
the State University of Pennsylvania gave me this teacher to teach him about communication .
and I was terrified .
and I was really frightened . the students who developed the brain , the <unk> of the brain , and the <unk> words that they read , and the long , long @-@ lived words were all <unk> to me .
but as the dialogue started , my experience was as Alice was , following the rabbit hole , and seeing that <unk> across into a completely new frontier .
that &apos;s how I felt when I was talking to the students , and I was surprised by their ideas , and I wanted others to experience it in their heads .
and I believe that the key to opening the door is to have a great conversation and communication .
in order to change the world , we really wanted to get a lot of communication from our scientists and engineers .
our scientists and engineers solve the biggest problems that we face , from energy to the environment to health care , and so on . if we don &apos;t understand them , they don &apos;t have anything to do with us , and I believe that we have a responsibility to interact with them as scientists .
but if our scientists and engineers aren &apos;t <unk> us to see their <unk> , we &apos;re not going to have good conversations .
so scientists and engineers , please tell us what high @-@ tech is .
and I want to share with you some useful methods that tell you how to make sure that we also think that your science is sexy , your <unk> .
the first question is , what about high @-@ tech ?
tell us why your science has something to do with us .
and I want to tell you about <unk> , which is to tell me that this skeleton is important for both recognition and treatment .
and when you describe the science of science , you have to pay attention to the technical use .
the jargon is that we understand one of your ideas .
and of course , you can say , &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; but why don &apos;t we know much about space and time ?
let your ideas be easy to understand and to simplify it .
instead , as Einstein said , &quot; Let &apos;s make everything as simple as possible , not simplify . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to change your perspective to convey your scientific theory .
you can think about using examples , stories , analogies . these are the ones that get you to talk about , to get us excited .
and when you show it with slides , don &apos;t use points .
have you ever thought about why a bullet might be called a bullet ?
what are the bullets doing ? the bullet can kill you , and it can kill you .
these are not just boring slides , but they &apos;re too dependent on our language areas , where we don &apos;t know what to do .
and this particular case was done by <unk> Brown , which was much better . it showed us the extraordinary structure of the <unk> , even the unique design of the Eiffel Tower .
the trick here is to use simple , flat @-@ lined sentences to allow the viewer to take even a little bit of an idea , and then to provide some images that could inspire our senses , and give us a deeper understanding of what &apos;s described .
so these are the key tools that I think help us open up the gate of the gate , to experience science and engineering .
and because the engineers that I worked with were teaching me about the academic <unk> that I had , I wanted to conclude with a equations .
with all of your science , forget your points and jargon , divided by related content , is to share something to the audience , and measure the passion you &apos;re doing right now , and it &apos;s equal to the incredible interaction that you &apos;re doing .
so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved the equation , everything is done , say high @-@ tech .
thank you .
one of my favorite words is called &quot; <unk> &quot; throughout Oxford .
not just because it sounds good .
and what it means is &quot; a self @-@ worth of politics . &quot;
and even though this was a wonderful definition by a newspaper editor in the 19th century , he said , &quot; <unk> is a guy like this , he would not care for a party or any other party or any reason , he would have been very hard to win . &quot;
I had no idea what <unk> meant .
it &apos;s about the vocabulary of speech , I suppose .
but speech is important for the political core , and all politicians understand that they have to try to control their <unk> .
for example , it was only time that newspapers allowed news stories to report what politicians said in their heads .
and it &apos;s actually all because of a brave man , the great name is <unk> <unk> , which proposed to our parliament .
and he was incarcerated in London , but he was brave enough to have the courage to have enough advice on the parliament , and ended up having a lot of support for him in London .
and just a few years later , we had our first record of using the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
a lot of people think that phrases come from metal .
no , it comes from an E @-@ terrorist act .
but in order to really demonstrate how words and politics influence each other , I want to take you back to the United States , where it just happened .
there was a question about what it was like to be George Washington , their leaders .
they don &apos;t know .
why should we be the leaders of a republic ?
that &apos;s a long time ago in Congress .
and there &apos;s a lot of advice , which seems to work .
I mean , some people want to call him the lead bank of Washington , and some people call him George Washington , and others call him George Washington , D.C.
there &apos;s no <unk> names .
some people just want to call him king .
they think it &apos;s a term that used and tested .
they didn &apos;t even follow the monarchy , and their idea was that you could be the king of the election with a fixed master .
you know , it probably works .
and every one of you has a sense of <unk> , and in fact , this debate has lasted three weeks .
I read a journal of the poor legislators at the time , and it was continuing , &quot; This is the issue . &quot;
and the reason that <unk> and <unk> is because of the Senate .
the Kansas House didn &apos;t want the power of Washington .
they didn &apos;t want to call him what he thought he was going to be the king or the <unk> .
so they gave him a title of what they could think of , the worst , the worst of all , the worst of all .
and this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
they didn &apos;t create this title . I mean , this was a headline , but it was a conference .
similar to the president of the jury .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be very , very high @-@ status compared to &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
there were moments of small meetings , and there was a sense of government governance , but it was a title for nothing .
and that &apos;s why the Senate against this title .
they said it was ridiculous , you couldn &apos;t call him a meeting host .
and this guy had to sign treaties and visit <unk> .
who would take it seriously , if he had only one of these stupid songs , like the federal government host the United Way .
and after three weeks of argument , there was no <unk> at all .
instead of <unk> , they agreed to <unk> on &quot; <unk> , &quot; but they also wanted to be absolutely certain that they didn &apos;t agree with the respect of the civilization , the respect of the civilization @-@ state , whether it &apos;s Democrats or Republicans or Democrats , they &apos;re going to be <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> by the chief &apos;s office , they don &apos;t want to be <unk> . &quot;
now you can see three interesting things in this story .
first of all , it &apos;s my favorite place , and so far I can find the information that the Senate has never been properly recognized as the &quot; president . &quot;
Barack Obama , the title of President Obama , came to the point where he was still on the waiting for the Senate .
the second thing you can see is that when the U.S. government declared this as a ad -- it &apos;s going to last decade .
but the third thing you can see , and it &apos;s also important , and I want you to remember the point , which is this quote , the federal government .
more than 5,000 weapons were held by him , and the largest economy in the world , and a lot of aircraft and his military .
truth and history give this title of purpose .
so the Senate won .
they had a great title for their honor .
and the other thing about the Senate , which is that it sounds strange -- oh , it used to sound weird in those days .
but now , do you know how many countries now have president ?
it &apos;s a horse .
and that &apos;s because they wanted their title to sound like the guy with 5,000 weapons , etc .
so at the end of the Senate , the Senate , won the House of Representatives , because no one &apos;s got a feeling when they &apos;re told they &apos;re now president of the federal government .
and this is a really important lesson , and I think what you can learn , and that &apos;s the point I want to leave you with .
politicians <unk> very quickly to define and use vocabulary to shape reality , but in fact , the reality is far greater than the reality of words .
thank you very much .
I went along with the 50 @-@ to @-@ <unk> battle on a truck , and when I was 19 years old , I was a vegetable dealer in Florida .
I took my black <unk> , I changed my <unk> , I took a brown pair of <unk> , and I photographed the tank of the <unk> government .
this was the first time I went to Afghanistan .
early on in the war , I was growing up on weekends , watching a football game , watching a boy with a boy of racism , fought with religious <unk> , shouting at the crowd , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and then in Afghanistan , we don &apos;t even know what that means when the statue is burned .
but that &apos;s the form of self .
so I &apos;m standing here today with the blood of Afghanistan , and the position of God , an atheist and a radical political artist , and I &apos;ve been living in Afghanistan for the last nine years .
in Afghanistan , you can show a lot of wonderful things by creating artwork , but I don &apos;t want to portray them from all of the things that people want to do to help them challenge themselves , and re @-@ explaining their behavior , even using a moral theory to understand our world .
I wanted to live a day in a war with a <unk> who beat the <unk> of communism , as the <unk> of the pop star of the pop star , and use the threat of religion , and make it rich .
these were the <unk> , except to go to Parliament to vote in public , and choose me , to choose me . I &apos;m a <unk> molecule . I &apos;m a <unk> ! &quot;
I was trying to use elections to try and reproduce the <unk> of the <unk> , the makeup of the national heroes .
I wanted to use a work called &quot; <unk> , &quot; to see corruption in Afghanistan , and to simulate a police station on the streets of Kabul , and to stop those cars , not a bribe , but to give them money to the name of the police station in Kabul , to their name in Afghanistan .
I wanted to know what to do with my point of view , and to explain how conflicts in Afghanistan have become an art of conflict .
the war and the <unk> of the war created this very style and fashion that was designed specifically for the soldiers and for the suicide bombers , and I added the brand of Afghanistan , and I added it to the brand new traditional pocket .
and I also wanted to put together a very simple Kabul and <unk> to the wall , to see how the art of modern art evolved from the old ones called &quot; white &quot; to save the brown skin , or to make them a little bit more peaceful .
but if you do that , you might be able to save prisons , they &apos;re going to be misunderstood .
but I had to do what I needed to do , because my ego asked me to do .
that &apos;s my burden . what about you ?
thank you .
Hi , Cameron Russell , who used to be a model .
well , 10 years .
now , I felt a kind of <unk> in this room because I wasn &apos;t supposed to wear a dress .
and Gene took another set .
this is the first live stage on the TED stage , so I think we &apos;re all very lucky .
if some women were right , I felt terrified , not telling me now , but I would Twitter instantly .
and I want to tell you that I have the privilege of being able to change my image in 10 seconds .
that &apos;s not what everybody can do .
and the high @-@ heels are uncomfortable , and the good news was I was not going to wear them .
the worst news is I &apos;m going to take this sweater off the head , because you &apos;re going to laugh at me , so when I wear my glasses , don &apos;t do anything .
that &apos;s it .
so why do I do this ?
it &apos;s strange .
well , I hope not to be a strange image .
the imagery is powerful , but it &apos;s also powerful .
I just changed my mind in six seconds .
in this photograph , I actually had no boyfriend in real life .
when the photographer had to memorize my back , I was very uncomfortable with the hair of that guy .
and sure enough , in addition to surgery , like two days ago , the brown brown brown thing that I did for my job , we were basically not able to change our appearance , even though it was <unk> , and yet it profoundly affected our lives .
so today , for me , it &apos;s going to be honest .
I stand here today because I &apos;m a model .
and I &apos;m on this stage because I &apos;m a beautiful , white woman who we call &quot; sexy girl . &quot;
and I want to answer that people often ask me about my questions in a very honest way .
the first question is , how do you become models ?
I always say , &quot; I &apos;m discovered , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t really mean anything .
the real reason I became a model model was that I had great genes , and I was a <unk> , and you were probably asking what the legacy was .
well , in the last couple of centuries , we &apos;ve defined beauty as not only health , but also young and small bodies that we use to celebrate , but also things like <unk> , <unk> color , feminine color , the skin .
that &apos;s my legacy . that &apos;s my legacy .
I know some of you may be familiar with this idea , and you might have some fashion figures , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
first of all , I want to give you credit for what you know about models .
but unfortunately , I have to tell you , in 2007 , a Ph.D. from NYU , was inspired by the number of people who were models in the workforce , only 27 percent of them were paid , not four percent .
the next question people ask me was , &quot; Am I grown up to be models ? &quot;
my first answer was , &quot; I don &apos;t know , because they didn &apos;t let me take care of it . &quot;
but the second answer , which I want to ask , is , &quot; Why ? &quot;
you know what ? you can choose any profession .
you could be the president of the United States , or the next generation of the Internet , or the Japanese <unk> , which is great , because you &apos;re the first .
if you listen to this , they say , &quot; No , no , no , I want to be a model , &quot; I would say , &quot; When my boss ? &quot;
because I can &apos;t define anything , you can be the editor of a magazine in the United States , or the CEO of <unk> , or the next Steven <unk> .
when you grow up , you want to be models , as you say , when you grow up , you want to win the lottery .
it &apos;s not within your grasp . it &apos;s a great model , but it &apos;s not a plan .
I &apos;m going to show you some of my models for a decade , because it &apos;s not like a traditional Japanese poet , but it &apos;s a real , real moment .
so if the photographer was here , the lights are right here -- for example , the beautiful fake client , who said , &quot; Cameron , I want to walk through a shoot , &quot; which is a long time ago , and the arm &apos;s behind , let &apos;s put three @-@ quarters of an arm in front of it , and then look at your 400 times .
it looked like this .
it &apos;s not like the one in the middle .
I didn &apos;t know what it was like .
the reality is , when you graduate , you have résumés , and you &apos;ve done some work , you can &apos;t say anything else , so if you say you want to be President of the United States , but you &apos;ve written on your résumé , and people are smiling at 10 years .
the next question people ask is , &quot; Do they take pictures ? &quot;
yes , they &apos;re almost like all of the pictures , but that &apos;s just a small part of the job .
this was the first prototype I ever had , and this was the first time I ever wore my <unk> .
I knew it was a bit private , but I was also young .
this is a photograph I took with my grandmother a few months ago .
this is the picture of the day .
I was with my friends .
this is a picture of me taken in the <unk> &apos;s pajamas a few days ago .
this is a picture of my team and <unk> magazine .
this is me right now .
what I want you to understand is that these are not my photographs .
it &apos;s based on a group of photographers , <unk> , photographers , photographers and their <unk> , their <unk> , and then they created these images , and they created them , not me .
the next question is , &quot; Can you get free ? &quot;
I really had no opportunity to wear an eight @-@ inch high heels , but something free was something that I &apos;d gained in real life , and that &apos;s exactly what we didn &apos;t want to talk about .
I was the mayor of Cambridge , and I walked into a shop and I forgot money , and they sent me a dress .
as a teenager , I drove along with my friends , she was a bad driver , and we had a red light on the road , and I said , &quot; Sorry , we &apos;re on the road .
and I got these because my appearance wasn &apos;t me , and some people paid for their appearance .
I live in New York , and last year there were 14 million young boys who were parking spaces , 86 percent of them black and Latino , mostly young boys .
and in New York , young black and Latino men are only 17 million , so the question is , &quot; Am I going to be park ? &quot;
it was , &quot; I &apos;m going to stop a couple of times ? when do I stop ? &quot;
and when I did this research , I found that in 13 @-@ year @-@ olds in the United States , 53 percent of their bodies went up to 17 , and that ratio went up to 78 percent .
so the last question is , &quot; What does a model feel like ? &quot;
and I guess the answer that they &apos;re expecting is , &quot; If you &apos;re a bit thinner , there &apos;s some <unk> in your hair , you &apos;re happier , it &apos;s unbelievable . &quot;
when we come back , we give an answer like this .
we said , &quot; Look , you can travel around and be creative , you can get people working together . &quot;
and it &apos;s only true , but it &apos;s only half of the fact that we &apos;re never going to say before the camera is , I &apos;m never going to say , &quot; I &apos;m not safe . &quot;
because I had to worry about what I looked like every day .
and if you &apos;ve ever thought about it , if my thigh is lighter , does it make me happier ?
you just look at models and see , because they have the most thin coat of their legs , the most beautiful hair , the coolest clothes , and they &apos;re probably the most insecure woman in the world .
so when I was prepared for this talk , it was hard to find a balance , because on the one hand , if I stand here and say , &quot; Look , I &apos;ve got so much pleasure out of nature , &quot; in my mind , it &apos;s uncomfortable to say , &quot; but it &apos;s also uncomfortable . &quot;
but the most difficult thing to do is to show you gender and racism , because I am the best of all .
but at the same time , I was very happy and respected , standing here , and I was young , not working for 10 , 20 , 30 years and models , and I couldn &apos;t get the most direct feeling , because I wasn &apos;t going to tell you how I got my first job .
and if this session gets you , I hope that we all embrace the power of imagery , the success and the failures that we understand .
thank you .
today I only want one thing .
don &apos;t say I &apos;m sane .
I want to introduce you to my two brothers .
he was 22 years old .
he didn &apos;t speak , but he was able to give a sense of pleasure in his own way , and the best of his talk was a home .
he knows what love is .
and he <unk> him for that love .
he didn &apos;t care what other people were .
he didn &apos;t care about religion , and he said , &quot; He never did . &quot;
and when he &apos;d sing the <unk> of our childhood , which I &apos;ve forgotten , he reminds me of the unknown things that we know about .
this year &apos;s 16 , and it &apos;s pretty hot .
he had extraordinary memory .
but the memory is selective .
he didn &apos;t remember stealing my chocolate , but remember when I was released from my iPod when I was four years old , and we were talking about <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> on my arm .
sounds pretty cool ?
but a lot of people don &apos;t think that way .
and the truth is , because their minds don &apos;t match the norms of normal people , they &apos;re often isolated , <unk> .
but what blew my mind was that even though they were not seen as normal , it was only one thing that was remarkable , even though they were autism .
some of you may not know too much about it , but it &apos;s a term called &quot; autism , &quot; which is a complex brain disorder that causes a social disorder , and learning disabilities .
every single case is different , so it &apos;s different from Sam .
in the world , every 20 minutes , there &apos;s a new diagnosis of autism diagnosis , one of the fastest @-@ growing diseases of the world , but we don &apos;t know why it &apos;s so likely and treatment .
I knew for the first time that &quot; autism &quot; was the first time , and I had a day where I knew nothing about autism .
when I was three , my brother was born , and I was so excited that I had a new family .
and just a few months later , I realized he was different .
he was screaming .
he didn &apos;t want to play like any other baby , and in fact he wasn &apos;t interested in me .
he stayed immersed in his own world , applied the principles of his own design , and he looked for the fun of walking around the house , looking at the washing machine and the washing machine .
as he grew up , he became more unique in these special places .
apart from the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> nature of his inability to look at the world , he &apos;s a man who never lies .
it &apos;s too simple .
I couldn &apos;t deny the family that there was a tough time , I thought they were like me .
but then I moved to what they taught me about personality and communication and love and love , and I realized that these things I didn &apos;t want to be normal .
the differences between the beauty and the human side are not the ones who represent the wrong side .
just to give you a sense of the right species .
I just want to say one sentence , which is that for Sam , you don &apos;t have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
whether it &apos;s autism or not there &apos;s a difference between all of us -- every one of us has a gift to be fair to say , &quot; <unk> &quot; -- that is to kill the potential .
the possibility of transcendence , progress and change is that we want to disappear from others .
please don &apos;t say I &apos;m normal . &quot;
thank you .
Dr. <unk> took this photographs of an apple and blew it out of our honor and wonder , and this photo took about a million seconds .
but now , 50 years later , we can get a million times faster , not only in a million seconds , but in a billion seconds , to capture the world .
now I &apos;m going to show you a new type of technology called <unk> imaging , which is a technology that can capture light very quickly .
so with this technology , we can make cameras out of the corners , and we can see beyond the horizon , or we can &apos;t use X @-@ rays of our body , and the camera challenges our definition of the camera .
now , if I use a laser pen , and within a trillion seconds a second switch -- that &apos;s a couple of times -- I &apos;m going to create some photons , all these photons are <unk> across , and these photons are just like a bullet , a million times slower than speed .
now , what if you put the bullet in , these photons all hit the bottle ?
what happens in slow motion ?
now , the whole thing .
now , please remember , this whole thing happened within a 10,000 @-@ plus @-@ a @-@ plus @-@ a @-@ million @-@ dollar time -- but now I &apos;m going to slow you down a million times .
but Coke didn &apos;t fund it .
now , there &apos;s a lot of things going on here , so let me give you a demonstration .
now , the beam comes into the bottle , which is our bullet , passes through the bottle , and puts it inside .
some of them came out , and on the table , you see the pattern .
many photons eventually got to the caps and went all around .
and as you can see , here &apos;s an air tank , and it bounce off .
and at the same time , the waves went to the table , and because of the reflection on the top of the bottle , you can see that as it sits on the bottom , it <unk> .
now , if you walk the same distance with a regular bullet , you slow down the video , you know , a million times , do you know how long you need to wait for this process ?
one day , a week ? actually , a year .
and this , of course , is boring , regular bullet points .
but what about some of these ?
you can see the pattern over and over again on the table , the background is tomato and wall .
it &apos;s like throwing a rock in a tank .
and I think that &apos;s how nature builds tomatoes , <unk> , but of course our eyes are integrated .
but if you look at this tomatoes , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> is walking through the tomatoes , it &apos;s always <unk> . it &apos;s not <unk> .
why ? because tomatoes know , and reflection from the inside of the <unk> , comes out in a couple of seconds .
so in the future , when you look at the camera in your cell phone , you can go to the supermarket and you can check the fruit .
so how did my team at MIT make this camera ?
now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to wear a film , you &apos;ve got a little bit of light , but we &apos;re going to need a million times faster than the smallest ones , so you &apos;re almost not going to get any light .
so what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve made these photons all the way up to 100 million times , and we do it all together with great <unk> , and then we &apos;ve created a picture , and this is what you saw before .
and we take all of that data and add it to it , and it &apos;s fun to do it .
now , Superman can fly .
some other heroes can be invisible , but imagine a future hero : he can see the corner .
and the idea is that we can put some of the door over the door .
and these lights reflect into the room , and some of them go back to the door and go into the camera , so we can use those optical reflection .
that &apos;s not true . we did .
on the left , you see our <unk> imaging cameras .
in the back of the wall , there &apos;s a bomb that we &apos;re going to do .
so in our essay , we published &quot; Nature , &quot; which was suggested naturally <unk> , and they created this animation .
we &apos;re going to launch these bullets , and they &apos;re going to hit the wall , and because the light is going to come in all directions , some of which end up going to our hidden <unk> , and it &apos;s going to continue to know that the door will reflect some light , but some of the light will go back to the camera , but they will hit the camera .
and because we have a camera that can run so fast , that &apos;s our camera , and that camera has a specific capability .
it has great time resolution , and it can capture the world at the speed of light .
so not only do we know where the camera gate is , but we know where the distance is , but we don &apos;t know which distance it is .
by using a laser , we can record an original photograph , which you see on the screen , which is kind of meaningless , but then we &apos;ll take photographs , lots and lots of them , put them together , and analyze the reflection , can we see the hidden object ?
can we look at <unk> ?
that &apos;s our model .
now we &apos;ve used some of these in our lives , but in the future , we can put this technology in the van so they can prevent impact , because they can see the corner , or we can see the device on the window , or we can see the device , or we can see it in the window , or we can see the device , or we can see the device .
but of course , because of the <unk> of organizations and blood , it &apos;s fairly difficult , and so we asked scientists to really value the science of <unk> , to take this technology as a new model for solving the health problem .
now , like Dr. Love <unk> , a scientist , science has become art , a high @-@ speed wave , and I realize that every time we collect lots of data , not just science imaging , but a new kind of computational photography , this technology has <unk> and color code , and we just remember that pattern is one of those curves .
but something interesting is happening .
when you see the pattern of the lid , they &apos;re moving away from us .
but the pattern should move us .
what happened ?
and it turns out , because we &apos;re <unk> these things at the speed of light , we have these strange phenomena , and Einstein &apos;s quite pleased to see these pictures .
the sequence of events happened in the camera , sometimes it &apos;s turned upside down , so we can change this <unk> of time and space .
so whether we see the corner , whether it &apos;s for the next generation or for the next generation , or whether we &apos;ve invented it , we &apos;ve put all of our data and all the details online , and we hope that this DIY group , this creative research group can tell us that we shouldn &apos;t get into the hands of another one -- the technologies that we should not get into .
it &apos;s about time . thank you .
this is where I live , Kenya , in the southern part of Nairobi National Park .
behind me was my father &apos;s cattle , in the back of the cow &apos;s National Park in Nairobi .
the southern part of the National Park in Nairobi has not gathered up the fences , which means that wildlife like zebras can move outside of the park .
so predators like lions follow their behavior .
they killed our livestock .
this is one of the cows that was killed at night , and I found out that it was dead in the morning , and I was feeling it , because it was the only <unk> I had at home .
our <unk> believed that we were bringing our animals and our homes from heaven to dung , life , that &apos;s why we value them .
so I became very interested in lions .
the families were the victims , and they were protecting our families and our livestock , but they were also depressed about this problem .
so they decided to killed the lions .
this is one of six lions killed in Nairobi National Park .
and I think that &apos;s why it &apos;s so small in Nairobi .
in our family , where six to nine percent of our boys have the responsibility to protect their fathers , the same cause happens to me .
so I had to find a solution .
the first way I thought about it was using fire , because I knew that lions were terrified of fire .
but I realized that this didn &apos;t work , and it helped the lion to see our <unk> .
but I didn &apos;t give up . I was quiet .
so here &apos;s the second way : use the grass .
I wanted to cheat the lion to get them right next to me .
but lions are very clever .
and the first day they came to see the <unk> , and they went back , but the next day , they would come back and say , &quot; This thing has never happened before . &quot;
so they were breeding , they killed the animals .
and one night , I was walking around with my flashlight , and the lions weren &apos;t there .
I started to realize that lions tend to fear movement .
so I had an idea .
because I was a kid , and I could just spend a couple of days in my own room , and one day , I even <unk> my mom &apos;s radio , and she almost killed me that day , I learned a lot about electronics .
so I found an old <unk> , an optical lure . this is a little gear that I found in a motorcycle that controls the <unk> of a motorcycle .
and at the same time , I found a switch that I could control the light on the lights .
the light bulb came from a broken flashlight .
everything was ready .
and as you can see , the solar cell picks up the battery , puts it in the battery , and then gives it an indication of the energy I call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and it turns out that it <unk> light .
and as you can see , the light bulb was gray , because the lion comes from there .
and when the lion comes up at night , it looks like this .
this light would blow up the lion into the bed , and they would expect me to walk around the room , but in fact , I was doing my own bed at the time .
thank you .
I put this device in my home two years ago , and since then , we had no lions feed .
my neighborhood had heard about it .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a whole bunch of birds that were hunted to the lion , and she asked me if I could help her with a lamp at home .
I didn &apos;t know .
I have these lights , and you can see on the back , these are the <unk> .
and so far , I &apos;ve been able to do this on the <unk> of our family , which is very useful .
now , my approach has been used by all of the people in Kenya to avoid other predatory animals , like hyena , and they &apos;re also used to <unk> their farm .
and I was very lucky to get a scholarship because of this invention , this is the best school in Kenya -- the International School of Art , which I was excited about .
my new school now comes in and helps me know and raise more money .
I even brought my friends back to my community , to help them install this in people who didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
a year ago , I was just a normal kid in a savanna to help his father , and I used to look at the plane , and tell myself , one day , I &apos;ll be in there .
today , I did .
I got an opportunity to fly to TED , and this was my first time .
so my great dream was : when I grew up , I became an airplane engineer and a pilot .
I used to hate lions , and now , because of my invention , I saved my father &apos;s cattle and we were able to get lions alive .
thank you very much . in my language , it means very much .
you can &apos;t believe how inspiring the story is .
so you &apos;ve got this scholarship . Richard Wurman : yes .
are you doing another electron ?
what &apos;s your next project ?
<unk> : my next invention was , I wanted to make an electric fence .
Di : I know , electricity bars are already here , but I just want to make my own one .
you &apos;ve tried it once , right , but you -- <unk> : I &apos;ve tried it before , but I stopped it , because it terrified me .
it &apos;s going to be a mystery . Richard <unk> , you &apos;re different .
we &apos;re going to build every step in your life , your friends .
thank you very much . <unk> : thank you .
I live in Los Angeles .
this is Los Angeles : a hotel , a food park , a place full of land .
so the planners of the city sit together and talk about what it means to take Los Angeles &apos;s name and change it , so they changed it to Southern Los Angeles , as if it were going to address the real problems of the city .
this is South Los Angeles .
<unk> hotels , food restaurants .
and like about 200 million Americans , I live in a food desert , and Los Angeles has <unk> fast food .
and what &apos;s interesting about this is that there &apos;s more people going to be killed by cars .
in Los Angeles , people were dying to cure disease .
for example , one of the neighborhoods in my neighborhood was five times the size of our block , maybe eight times smaller than the rest of our neighborhood .
I was tired of the reality .
at the same time , if there &apos;s no way to get healthy food , what do you feel , if you come out from your home , see the food systems on your community , what do you feel ?
I see a wheelchair as a sort of <unk> automobile .
I saw the <unk> center like Starbucks .
I don &apos;t want to get there anymore .
and I think the answer has been hidden in the question .
food is a problem . food is a solution .
add that up to a 45 @-@ minute drive to buy an apple that didn &apos;t get a <unk> .
so what I did was I put food into my house .
it &apos;s something we call <unk> .
150 feet by 10 feet .
<unk> are everywhere .
but people need to maintain it .
so I thought , &quot; Great ! this is my responsibility , I have to maintain it , so I want to do something ! &quot;
that &apos;s why I maintain it .
so my team and I , &quot; L.A. &quot; came together , and we started growing our own food forests , and we had a whole variety of vegetables .
we &apos;re a free @-@ institutional construction , a collection of different cities , all volunteers , all of which we &apos;re doing .
the garden was beautiful .
but very quickly somebody complained .
the government <unk> me , gave me a message , and I had to take away my garden and turn it into a warning .
and I was like , &quot; What ? what ?
it wasn &apos;t enough to use it in a small patch of land , and nobody was paying attention ?
and I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s it . &quot;
because it didn &apos;t happen .
so the Los Angeles Times reported that Steven <unk> wrote a story about it , and he talked to a member of the <unk> community , and they transmitted it to <unk> , and they collected 900 signed , and we succeeded .
we were successful with our hands .
and even the legislators came to visit , and it was such an honor and love what we did .
I mean , of course , how can they do it ?
the number of empty spaces in Los Angeles had in the upper quarter .
it has 26 square kilometers of open space .
that &apos;s 20 Central Park .
there &apos;s enough room to grow 250 million species of bananas .
why do they feel so bad ?
a tree can get 1,000 , maybe a hundred .
a dollar can produce 75 dollars for you .
this is my mantra , I tell people , grow your own food .
it &apos;s like a food <unk> .
see , I had the legacy in Los Angeles .
I grew up there , and I was raising my son there .
I refused to be a part of the reality that someone built for me to create my own reality .
see , I &apos;m an artist .
the work of the garden is my graffiti , and I create my own art .
it &apos;s like graffiti artists , <unk> walls , and I , <unk> the lawn .
I saw the garden and the land as canvas , and the plants and the trees are decorated on my canvas .
you would be shocked to be able to do it if you looked at it as your canvas .
you can &apos;t imagine how amazing it was , and what it would do to people .
what happens ?
I watched my garden turn into an education tool , a tool for my community reform .
to change the community , you have to change the nature of the soil .
we are soil .
you were shocked by how children affected .
the gardening movement is the most healthy and challenging activity , especially in the inner city .
add that to it .
and I remember one day , a mom and daughter came out of nowhere at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evenings in my garden , and as I saw them , they were embarrassed .
their presence made me feel dreadful , and I told them , you don &apos;t have to take food like this .
this is the reason why it &apos;s on the street .
and when I looked at people around me , it made me feel very valuable . and it became my determination to make food . people ask me , &quot; Don &apos;t you steal anything ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; Well , of course , I &apos;m not sure people steal it .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
that &apos;s what I want .
I want people to take it , but at the same time , I want people to be healthy . &quot;
and one of the other things that happened to me was a homeless kid in downtown Los Angeles .
and the boys helped me figure out what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s cool . they shared stories about how gardens affects them , and how they shared their own stories with their own mothers and their grandmother , and they see that the garden can change them for a really cool moment .
green fields started to put in maybe 20 gardens .
we &apos;ve got about 50 people involved in our team ; they &apos;re all volunteers .
if the kids grow food , the kids eat it .
if they grow their tomato , they eat their tomato .
but when these kids don &apos;t see them in front of their eyes , if they don &apos;t realize how food affects people &apos;s thoughts and bodies , they just eat them blindly .
I saw young people who wanted to work , but they were happy to spend a lot of time in this process , and I saw children with different skin color , and they were always <unk> on the way they were designing for them , and there was a road .
and when it comes to gardening , I found an opportunity to train these kids to take over their communities , to live a sustainable life .
when we do that , who knows if we will .
the next George Washington .
but if we don &apos;t change the soil , we will never .
this led to one of my plans . this is what I want to do .
I wanted to have a whole garden garden garden in a neighborhood where people could share food .
I wanted to convert the container for health .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
I didn &apos;t think free , because free is free .
and the nice thing about sustainability is that you have to maintain it .
what I &apos;m talking about is getting people to work , to get kids out of the street , to get their joy , their pride , their pride , the open farmers .
so what I wanted to do was to make it more appealing .
I wanted us to be the <unk> of the environmental revolution , the rogue , the guards .
we &apos;re going to bend rogue .
if you &apos;re not a flower , you &apos;re not a rogue .
are you wearing a rogue ?
let alone become the weapons of your choice .
basically , if you want to meet me , if you want to meet me , if you want to talk about some of the missing devices in the comfortable seat .
and if you want to think about me , just take the garden and come to the garden , then we can make something .
thank you .
thank you .
three months ago , three months ago , I was a photographer of photography , New York City .
we didn &apos;t know what to do .
we had a room in pitch black , <unk> , and the studio had no window , essentially for the sun .
we were able to take a slim @-@ bodied model , to make the beautiful skin <unk> better , make it impossible , turn it into possibility , and we were criticized at the media , but we were actually brilliant artists , experienced images and photographs .
on March 11th of 2011 , as others around the world , I saw the tragedy of Japan at home .
soon after I was volunteering at an organization called <unk> , the team was running out of nowhere , within a few days , at a local emergency rescue .
I know this with other volunteers : we can &apos;t afford to be at home . so I decided to join them for three weeks and volunteer .
on May 13 , I came to Japan .
it was a small fishing village in Japan , and it was about 50,000 people , and it was about 70 million people .
the tsunami was higher than 24 meters , and it landed about two miles inland .
as you can imagine , this little town was <unk> .
and we came out of that rubble and into the <unk> .
we were helping schools and cleaning up homes so that we could rebuild and <unk> .
we cleaned up a lot of <unk> , aggressive fish , and those fish were processed and processed fish .
we also became very dirty , but we were very upset .
and within weeks , all of the volunteers , like the local people , found something like this .
and they kept finding photos and photos and photographers and <unk> .
and everybody &apos;s doing the same thing .
they took these photographs and collected them to take care of them .
and it wasn &apos;t until now that I realized that I had lost a significant part of these photographs .
and when they were attacked by the tsunami , you had to think , you know , you had to do something , you had to put it all over the place .
the last week I stayed in Japan , I found myself in a place where I was trying to help save the <unk> .
help a <unk> clean ground .
and it happened to be collecting pictures of people who were evacuated at the site .
I was so privileged to get their trust , to start clean , to get back to that picture .
and that moment of interest , and it &apos;s very powerful , and I &apos;ve been listening to people and saying , &quot; Be creative , until cleaning those pictures , I really did what &apos;s called innovation . &quot;
and when I look at those pictures , there are more than a hundred years of history , some of them have been saved in the lab , and I &apos;ve come from a single @-@ point point point of view , maybe I can help them repair the photos of the <unk> and the <unk> , and I know that many of them will be able to recover .
so on that evening , I was going to go to Facebook and I asked some friends , and in the morning , there were lots and lots of news , saying they were willing to help , and I knew we should act .
and so we started doing the same thing .
this is the first shot .
it wasn &apos;t a hell of a lot of damage , but it was caused by a little girl &apos;s face , and we had to repair it very well .
otherwise , the face of a little girl &apos;s face doesn &apos;t look like her face -- a tragedy or a tragedy , just like a picture .
and over time , more and more of these photographs have been transported , and we have to have more than two dozen of them to help , so I went to Facebook and professional links to find help , just five days , and only eight people would come from 12 different countries .
and within two weeks , I got 150 volunteers and they said they would join us .
so by July , just in Japan , we &apos;ve set up <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is the north branch of North Carolina .
every week , we were scanning devices , people came to these makeshift photographs .
and sometimes , some older women have never seen a scanner , and they find photos that they &apos;ve lost , and within 10 minutes , they can scan them to the cloud , and they upload it to the cloud , and then the photo will be taken up by a non @-@ Japanese or strangers , maybe from the other side of the planet .
and for that time , they took the time back and took the pictures away , which , of course , rely on the damage .
maybe an hour would repair it , and maybe it would take weeks .
maybe a few months .
the beauty of this picture has to be processed by hand , or by inch , to get rid of the color of the dead , to take the details of where there &apos;s no water left .
the whole process is very much time .
and all of these photographs of the tsunami , <unk> of bacteria , buried in the trash , buried in the garbage , sometimes covered in <unk> , all of which had been <unk> for a long time , and so hand @-@ <unk> is a big part of this project .
and if these pictures don &apos;t clean first , we can &apos;t fix them , they have to dry , they have to dry out .
our hand @-@ washing activities are pretty good .
there &apos;s a woman who <unk> us .
these pictures are very easy to damage again .
as the captain of my team once said , it &apos;s like having a tattoo on people .
you can &apos;t make a mess , otherwise it will make a mess .
and the woman who gave us these photographs was very fortunate .
and she started washing her photographs , until she realized that she had more damage to the photo .
well , she had a copy of that picture .
otherwise , in this photograph , she and her face were completely <unk> , and we were able to put all of the parts together into a good photograph and then re @-@ create this photo .
and when she got the picture from us , she shared the stories behind us .
her photo was actually found by her husband &apos;s colleague , in the local fire brigade , and it was actually very far away from her family , and they recognized him .
the day of the tsunami , he was making sure that the tsunami was closed .
an alarm goes on , and he has to rush to the front lines .
her two sons , though they were big , they were in two schools .
one of the kids was shocked .
she &apos;d been home for a week for the first time , and they were all alone .
and the day after that came back , she was the 14th birthday of her son .
and for her , despite the extraordinary <unk> of our fears and <unk> , the photographs that gave him the best gifts for his son , which allowed him to go back to , to remember , to remember , to a day of March , to give him his life to change , or to wreck everything in his life .
six months after Japan stayed in Japan , together with one million volunteers , 100 volunteers to join the Japanese in helping us to clean up more than four million pictures , most of which -- most of them .
most of it went back to the corner , and it was important .
more than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to come back to 90 families , and these photographs were reconstructed , <unk> .
during that time , we didn &apos;t spend billions of dollars on equipment or materials , and most of it was done using ink .
we take pictures .
it &apos;s a photo of a remind and a reminder that some of us , some things , some place , a sense of affection , somebody who loves it .
they were helping us record , remembering recall and our past , the most immediate moments of emergency space that we had , but sometimes the first thing we wanted to get back .
that &apos;s the whole project , all of it , to try to restore the little pieces of human nature , to save people from the past .
and when a picture of its owner , it will bring a huge difference , and it will bring a lot of difference in life .
and this project also changed a lot .
and for some <unk> , this experience set up some connections to them , to some bigger things , such as back @-@ to @-@ society , to exercise their talents , not only for models , but for people with perfect skin .
I want to end by giving you an email , and I get one of them from <unk> , six months later , from Japan .
&quot; when I was fixing those photographs , I was reminded of the stories that each of them and the photographs were uploaded .
and in particular , one of the women who took photographs , went to the grandmother , went to a little girl , <unk> around a baby , and it really hit the heart , because there was a picture of my home , my grandmother , my mother , my daughter , my daughter , my daughter , my daughter , this picture of my family .
all around the world , beyond age lines , we have some of the most fundamental needs of all time , right ? &quot;
thank you .
today , I &apos;d like to talk about a disturbing question , and the answer to that question as well .
I &apos;m going to talk about the secret of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to answer is , &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot;
&quot; how would somebody live with her men ? &quot;
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker , a social worker .
I &apos;m just a woman who has a personal story .
I was 22 years old , just graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York , and I started my own first job as magazine and <unk> .
I had my own house for the first time , and I had the first credit card . I had a very big secret .
and the secret was that I had been struck by the men of my soul that had a lot of guns attached to my head , a lot of times .
this man I always loved , pointing at my head , threatening to kill me , and I had no idea how many times I had done .
now the story that I told you about this &quot; crazy love &quot; is a psychological trap , a million women every year , including some men that fell into this trap .
maybe it &apos;s happening to you .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic victim .
I had a college degree of English education , and I got an MBA degree in business .
most of the time is working for the Fortune 500 companies , including Johnson , D.C. and Washington Post .
I married my husband for almost 20 years with three children .
he built a black <unk> , he <unk> the van .
that &apos;s the first thing I want to tell you about : domestic violence may not be about your ethnicity , faith , income and education .
it &apos;s everywhere .
the second thing I want to talk about is that a lot of people think that if domestic violence occurs to women , it should be women .
no .
over 85 percent of the <unk> are men , and domestic violence is only happening in intimacy , in a long @-@ term relationship , in other words , in families , and this is one of the things that we most don &apos;t want to see , or in particular , and this is one of the reasons why violence is so called domestic violence .
I used to think that only one of my men in the world would continue to stay with my men , but it was actually very common in my age .
I was 22 years old . and in the United States , 16 to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds were more likely to be killed by more women than any other age , or my husband .
I &apos;m a very typical victim , and I know nothing about my own domestic violence and development .
I met <unk> in a pool of water , and it was January , and it was cold .
we sat in a subway in New York , and he talked to me first .
he told me two things .
the first was that he graduated from Connecticut school , and worked in a very good Wall Street bank .
but the first thing that happened to me was his wisdom and humor , and his <unk> seemed like a farm boy .
his face looks like a giant wheat <unk> in the palm of an apple , like an apple .
the most brilliant thing that happened to me in the first few years is to convince me that I was one of the most powerful things .
and at the beginning , he made me think that I was the icon of his worship .
we started getting involved , and he liked everything about me , my clever , my training experience at Harvard , giving birth to young women , and my job .
he wanted to know my family , my childhood , my wish and my dreams .
I had never been there before as a woman and a <unk> .
and through his unknown secrets , he made a compassionate atmosphere between us , and he told me that he had been on his four @-@ year @-@ old <unk> , he began to sin in his body , and the result of his abuse was so that he had to drop out in eighth grade , and he had a pretty smart life .
that &apos;s why the university degree , the work of Wall Street and the bright future , is significant to him .
if somebody said to me at that time that this wise , humor , <unk> and love the guy who orders me one day to wear hair , that my skirt can live very short , what I do , what work I want to do , what friends and who are living at Christmas , and I &apos;m going to laugh at you , because I don &apos;t see if I &apos;m violent or violent .
and I didn &apos;t know , <unk> and <unk> were the first steps in terms of domestic violence .
I had no idea that the next step was an isolated victim .
he didn &apos;t come home . he said to me , &quot; Hey , you know , it &apos;s nice to get into the next phase , but we &apos;re going to be isolated from you and abuse you . &quot;
and the truth is , he came home from a Friday night and told me he quit his job , and he said he &apos;d quit his job , and he said he &apos;d quit his job , because I &apos;d let him quit his job and his safety , and he didn &apos;t have to prove that he had to go to a city , and now he didn &apos;t really want to take his lifestyle , you .
what I didn &apos;t want to do at the time was leave New York and leave my favorite job , but for my own soul , I thought I needed to make a sacrifice . so I agreed to quit my job , quit my job and left Manhattan .
I felt like I was in a crazy romantic love , and I had no idea that I &apos;d walked into a elaborate <unk> control of your body , your heart and your economy .
the third phase of domestic violence is to begin to look at her response to violence .
that &apos;s what the gun used .
we just moved to New England , and -- I think , <unk> should be safe here -- he bought a gun .
there &apos;s a truck that sits on the pad .
a pillow underneath the bed , and the bed is still sitting in your pocket .
he said that when he was a kid , he needed to have these guns .
to keep him safe .
the gun was a obvious signal to me , even though he didn &apos;t pick up the dot and pointed at me , I was no longer at risk .
I was five days before my wedding night .
that &apos;s <unk> morning , and I was wearing <unk> .
I was working with a computer , and I wanted to do a <unk> job , and I was sort of <unk> down my mind , using my hands , my neck , my neck @-@ down , so I couldn &apos;t breathe , and he was <unk> my neck from behind .
five days later , 10 fingers on my neck <unk> , I put on my mom &apos;s <unk> , married him .
and despite all of that , I believe that we can live in a world where we love it , because we love it .
and he made this deep sense .
he just got too much stress , and the wedding meet came and gave him a break .
this was an accident , and he wouldn &apos;t hurt me anymore .
I was struck twice as soon as I could .
for the first time , I was going to look for the secret beach , and I was lost , and he was beaten by my head , and it was so heavy that my head was going into the front door to the door .
the traffic jams that he &apos;d been driving home from his late night before he got too upset , and he threw a cold Mac on my face .
in the two and a half years of my life , I was beaten twice a week .
I was alone , and I was alone .
in fact , one out of three American women has been a victim of domestic violence or a potential target , and according to that report , there &apos;s a 1.5 million child abuse every year .
so in fact , I &apos;m not alone .
back to my question : why am I staying ?
and the answer is simple .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
and even though he pointed to my head with a gun on a gun , he pushed me up against my dog , to kill the keys on the freeway , and as I was preparing for my clothing , I had never thought of being a abuse of my face .
on the contrary , I &apos;m a very strong woman in love with this troubled man , and I &apos;m the only person in the world to help someone who has lost their lives .
the other question everyone wanted to ask was , why didn &apos;t she leave ?
why didn &apos;t I flee ? I had a lot of opportunities .
for me , this is the most devastating question that people ask me about heartbreak and suffering , you can &apos;t understand , but only our victims know how dangerous it is to leave the perpetrators .
because the last step in domestic violence was to kill her .
more than 70 percent of domestic violence occurs after the victim ends of that relationship , after she left , because the victim had died .
other possible results include long @-@ term tracking , or even <unk> , or <unk> , to fight the economy , to <unk> the victim and her children .
now we still ask , why don &apos;t she flee ?
and the reason I decided to leave was because of the last brutal beating that I could afford .
and I realized that if I didn &apos;t resist , this man that I loved would kill me .
so I broke my silence .
and I went to everybody : police , neighbors , my friends and family , totally strange people , and I can stand here today , because everybody here has helped me .
we tend to think of victims as <unk> , <unk> women , like the worst title of the news .
&quot; why is she leaving ? &quot;
some of them were actually saying , &quot; It &apos;s her own fault , as if the victim is intentionally or the <unk> of their men in love .
but after the book came out , a lot of men and women told me their stories , and they wanted to tell people that they learned from what was happening , and they started living their lives -- happy lives -- as mothers , mothers and mothers , as I now live in violent situations .
in fact , I &apos;m a typical domestic victim , a typical domestic survivor .
I got married with a very soft man , three children .
he built a black <unk> , he <unk> the van .
and what I would never have , ever again , was a mouth that said love had a gun pointed at my head .
at this moment , you &apos;re probably thinking , wow , this is amazing , or , &quot; Oh , she &apos;s amazing , &quot; but in the process , I &apos;m talking about you .
I would assure you , there are now people who are listening to me who are suffering from abuse or being abused when you were a child .
torture could happen to your daughter , your best friends .
I was able to end my story of madness to break silence .
I &apos;m still in silence today .
that &apos;s the way I help other victims , and that &apos;s the last request I ever asked for you .
tell someone you &apos;ve heard today .
torture was only in silence .
you have the power to stop domestic violence just to light up .
our victims need help everyone .
we need each of you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
with your children , your colleagues , your friends and family , talk about this topic , abuse of light .
help survivors rediscover a beautiful , lovely self , a future .
the discovery of domestic violence is very serious , reducing the probability of what happens , providing the victims a safe path .
let &apos;s face it , let &apos;s take our beds , our dining room and our home and our family into the safe , peaceful oasis .
thank you .
when I was a child , I thought my country was the best in the world . and after a while I was a kid called <unk> .
I felt very proud .
in schools , we spend a lot of time learning history , but we never knew anything about the outside world , except for the American and Korea and Japan .
and although I always wanted to think about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , all of a sudden .
when I was seven years old , I first witnessed public execution , but I thought I was living in North Korea .
my family wasn &apos;t poor . and for myself , I had never experienced starvation .
but one day in 1995 , my mom took a letter from her sister &apos;s sisters .
and it says , &quot; When you read this letter , all five of my family would leave behind because we hadn &apos;t eaten for two weeks .
we &apos;re lying on the floor right now , and our bodies are so poor and they &apos;re ready to die . &quot;
and I was shocked .
it was the first time I heard what people were in my country .
and very soon after that , when I walk through a train station , I see a very painful thing that makes me happy .
a dying woman is lying on the ground , holding a sick child , and that child only <unk> his mother &apos;s face .
but no one helped them , because they couldn &apos;t afford their families .
in the mid @-@ 1990s , North Korea had a terrible famine event .
unfortunately , over a million North Koreans died in famine , and many of the survivors were eating grass , <unk> and <unk> .
the power is getting more and more and more frequent , all the things around me at night are going to be pitch black , except for the water in China , and as long as it goes through my own river .
and I often wonder why they have <unk> and we don &apos;t .
this is a satellite photograph of North Korea and <unk> .
this is <unk> , as part of the border between China and North Korea .
as you can see , the river is very , very narrow in some places , and it &apos;s very narrow from North Koreans to China .
but a lot of people were dying .
sometimes I see the body in the water .
I couldn &apos;t disclose all the details that I had left North Korea , but I could only say that was the toughest years in famine , and I was brought to China and relatives .
and I thought , I was just separated from my family for a very short time .
but I had no idea that we were there for 14 years .
in China , I was struggling as a young girl .
I had no idea what my life would be like to be a refugee from North Korea , but I quickly realized that it was a very difficult life , not only because North Korea was considered illegal immigrants in China .
so I was always living in fear , and I was afraid that my identity would be detected , and I would send it back to North Korea , to suffer the tragic destiny .
one day , my worst nightmare came true , and I was grabbed by the Chinese police and brought in to the police station .
I was sent to North Koreans , so they tested my Chinese language , and they asked me a lot of questions .
and I was very scared , and I was feeling that my heart was speeding up .
if I had any money , I would go to jail and send it back .
I thought I was out of my life , and still , I was trying to hide my own fears and concerns and answer their questions .
after that , a cop said to another person , &quot; paper is wrong .
she &apos;s not North Koreans . &quot;
and they put me in . it &apos;s a miracle .
some North Koreans were seeking asylum in China to go to the foreign embassy , but a lot of them were caught by the Chinese police , sent back to North Korea .
the girls were lucky .
and despite the fact that they were caught , the largest international community , they were released .
but a few North Koreans were too lucky .
every year , hundreds of thousands of North Koreans were arrested in China and sent them back to Korea , and they were tortured or executed .
although I was lucky enough to leave North Korea , a lot of my people didn &apos;t have that good fortune .
it &apos;s a very tragic fact , and that is that North Koreans have to live in a very difficult way to survive .
even though they &apos;ve learned to read Chinese , they &apos;ve found jobs , and the whole world is fundamentally changing .
and that &apos;s why , 10 years later , I decided to take risks to Korea , and that &apos;s why I started a new life .
it was more difficult than I could think of it .
English is so important in Korea , so I had to start learning the third door -- English .
moreover , I realized that there was a huge difference between Korea and North Korea .
even though we were all alone , our inner selves were very different , and we were divided by 67 years .
I &apos;ve even experienced self @-@ questioning .
were I Korean or North Koreans ?
where do I come from ? who am I ?
and all of a sudden , I couldn &apos;t even call any country for myself .
I still decided that I was not comfortable in Korean lives .
go to college .
and shortly after I started getting used to a new life , I got an incredible telephone call .
and I was sent to a part of my life , and as punishment , my family was forced to move to a rural place .
they had to flee , so I started planning to get them out .
North Koreans migrate to freedom as such <unk> .
and to go across the border of North Korea and South Korea is almost impossible , so the irony is , I flew to China and then to the border .
because my family didn &apos;t know Chinese , so I had to help them go through the <unk> and go into Southeast Asia .
we had a week on the bus , and a few of them were caught .
and again , we were sitting in a bus , and a Chinese officer was on the bus .
he looked at every card , and he started asking questions .
because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , I feared they were caught .
so when the Chinese officers quickly went to my house , I instinctively told him that these are the <unk> , and I was the <unk> .
he suspected looking at me , but fortunately , he believed me .
so we went all the way to <unk> , but I would almost like to spend nearly all of my light savings to bribe the border .
and even though we had arrived , my family and I was arrested for illegal participation .
after spending my life on the fine and bribe , my family was released a month later , but soon , they were caught in the capital capital of the <unk> capital , and they were caught .
that was one of the lowest moments in my life .
I had to let my family be free , and I was able to get the best I could get out of jail at a time , and the family had to go through it , and it wasn &apos;t very far from North Korea .
I was <unk> and the police station , busy <unk> many times , desperately trying to get them out , trying to get them out , but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay for the bribe or the fine .
I didn &apos;t know .
and at this point , I heard a person asking me , &quot; What ? &quot;
and I was amazed , a completely strangers , asking this question .
I used a bad English language , and I explained to that person , and that person went to the ATM machine , and it paid all the rest of my family and two North Koreans .
and I really appreciate him and I say , &quot; Why would you help me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
I was helping North Korea . &quot;
and I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life .
that good stranger is a symbol of mine and North Koreans , and he made me realize that strangers , kindness and international community , are really the hope for North Koreans .
and eventually , after a long trip , I and my family were there in Korea , but freedom was only half of wars .
a lot of North Koreans and their families , and when they come to new countries , they usually have very little money or <unk> .
so we can get education , English training , job training , work , etc .
we can also bridge the gap between the people living in the world and the people living in North Korea , because a lot of us live in contact with families in North Korea , and the information and the money that we have moved to North Korea .
and I was so lucky that in my life , I was able to help and help , so I wanted to help the North Koreans , in the international aid , an opportunity to dream .
and I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to see that more and more North Koreans are on the stage of the world , including TED .
thank you .
you may agree on that road probably .
it &apos;s made of asphalt , tar is a great material , driving it well on top , but not always , particularly like today &apos;s weather .
a lot of water on <unk> .
especially if you &apos;re riding through a bicycle , walking through those cars , it &apos;s not very nice .
and at the same time , there &apos;s a lot of noise .
and this material is a bit noisy , and if we &apos;re going to build our roads , like the Dutch road , we &apos;re going to want little noise .
the solution is to use tar sands .
porous tar material , which uses most of the highways of the Netherlands , has little pores that allow water to flow next to each other , and the road is easy , and no <unk> .
noise disappears into these pores .
because it has a lot of empty , it <unk> the noise , so the road is silent .
and of course , it has weaknesses , and the downside of this path is that asphalt is <unk> .
what &apos;s called <unk> ? look at the rock off the road .
and then I started off , and I got more and more , and then -- I couldn &apos;t demonstrate .
but they damage you , and you &apos;re not happy .
and in the end , it will bring more and more damage .
and sometimes you get on the road .
ah , he was ready .
and it turns out to be a problem , but we have a solution .
what you see here is the damage of this material .
this is the tar sands , and as I said , there &apos;s a few hairs in the middle .
and because of <unk> , ultraviolet , <unk> , the reason for this glue , which is this tar sands , which cuts between the <unk> , if it contract , then you get a little bit of <unk> , and starts to <unk> .
if you &apos;re driving along this way , you &apos;re going to see these <unk> -- that &apos;s what we see .
and to address that , we looked at self @-@ repair materials .
if we could make this material self @-@ repair , we could have a solution .
and what we did was , we used the steel workers , the steel workers , the steel workers , the steel workers , that we <unk> the little bits .
so now the tar sands have some <unk> inside .
you need another machine like this , a sensing motor -- that can be used for cooking .
sensing the motors can heat things , especially hot steel .
so what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to heat it up , melt it , melt it , take the tar sands , and eliminate the layers of the small cracks , and then get sticky .
because the sensing is too heavy , I &apos;m performing it here with the <unk> .
and the same principle of <unk> .
I put it in , and now I take it and see what happens .
this is what it looks like today .
we have four billion machines in our lab to heat them .
we tested lots of samples , and the government saw our results , and they decided , &quot; This is interesting , we should try . &quot;
the government licensed a highway for us , and on the fourth floor , we have a material test there .
and that &apos;s what we did . and what you see here is that the mile , of course , this road , of course , is not going to be bad in recent years . we confirmed .
we took a lot of samples in the lab .
so we did the old experiments , and we added a lot of <unk> , using our sensors to heat them up , heating and test them .
we can make a difference .
in fact , the conclusion of this experiment was that if we had heated it every four years -- the <unk> , we had to move this machine up to the highway -- we had double the life expectancy of the road , of course , every four years .
so the conclusion is that we &apos;ve created a material that we &apos;ve used to use , and we &apos;ve added a sense of energy that &apos;s effectively increasing the longevity of the road , double the duration of the road , using this simple technique , a lot of money .
you wonder if it works .
we looked at this prototype . it &apos;s still hot .
in fact , I &apos;m going to let it cool down to show you if heated works .
but try .
see , actually , fix it .
thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
there are <unk> birds on Earth .
<unk> are the most endangered species in them .
and when you look at <unk> like this , the first thing that comes out of your mind is that this is some <unk> , some <unk> , some of the terrible things that you can &apos;t help but think of politicians .
I want to change that way . I want to change the way you think about it , because they need our compassion . they really need it .
let me tell you why .
first of all , why do they leave us alone with this ?
Charles Darwin , in the flight of the Atlantic Ocean , captured the traveling through the Atlantic , discovered Turkey , and he said , &quot; These small boats , the birds of the <unk> , the birds of the <unk> , are always <unk> out of the <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s hard to find more harmful than this one , but it &apos;s Charles Darwin .
you know , Darwin went back to England and changed his perspective , and I &apos;ll tell you why .
and Walt Whitman also showed up -- things like the <unk> dog , <unk> , into <unk> , dumb , dumb animation .
and lately , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to the news of Kenya -- the members of Kenya are blessed to be <unk> and stupid .
I want to question it . you know why ?
because members of Congress can &apos;t keep the natural clean .
you can &apos;t stop transmission of disease .
almost no one &apos;s been following a week .
they &apos;re far from extinction .
and that one of my favorites is much better than the legislators .
there &apos;s <unk> in the world .
the New World Trade Center grew mainly in the Americas , in the Americas , in the Americas , in Venezuela , and in other continents , there were 16 species of risk of extinction , and of course there were 11 of them .
so why is this important ? well , first of all , the ecological cycles are crucial to the circulation . they do their job .
this is our natural waste .
they &apos;re going to eat the meat of their bodies , and they &apos;re going to have a <unk> .
they were able to eliminate all the bacteria on the body , and they were able to absorb the transmission of the virus from the virus to the spread of the virus , from the animals and from the disease .
recent studies have shown that in parts of the body that don &apos;t live , there &apos;s three to four times more damage to the disease transmission and spreading the disease .
there &apos;s a lot of historical significance as well .
they had closely related contact with their ancient ancestors .
there &apos;s a symbol of <unk> <unk> <unk> in ancient Egypt , of <unk> and <unk> , that often comes along with the <unk> of Egypt and the <unk> of Egypt .
in the Hindu myth , <unk> <unk> , he risked his life from 10 evil spirits <unk> by the <unk> .
in Tibet , the culture of <unk> seemed to be particularly important , in places like Tibet , where there were no <unk> , or there was no wood to go out and have a natural process for the local people .
so what are the problems that face these problems ?
Kenya grows to eight <unk> , and six of them are dying .
many of the reasons why conservation has been raging , which is because of the fact that humans and wildlife that are happening in Kenya have been fought for poison , and they have used poison and they have subsequently become the next victim .
in South Asia , there are countries like India and Pakistan , and there are four that have become endangered , which means that within 10 to 15 years or 15 years , the extinct , the reason why they have been fed up with <unk> acid , which is because of the <unk> acid , which has been fed with <unk> acid , which is the result .
now there are <unk> acid <unk> that have been banned in India , and the government has made a positive attitude .
and because of the <unk> of the herd , the wild dogs were able to grow dogs around the animals , in the wild , in the wild , and in the same time period , the number of cases occurred in India .
Kenya is going to have the largest wind power plant in Africa : wind turbines going to be installed in a vertical zone .
I &apos;m not against the wind , but we should be calling the government to rethink the decision , because wind farms cause threat to birds , and high @-@ speed <unk> the birds in half .
they &apos;re just birds .
in West Africa , there are people who have no sense of compassion to meet the needs of <unk> and <unk> .
what are we doing ? we &apos;re looking at these <unk> . we &apos;re putting them on them .
we were trying to figure out what the relationship was , and what was going on in terms of the grass .
we discovered that they travel between different countries , so if you just focus on one area , you can &apos;t make any progress .
we need to work with governments around the world .
we &apos;re trying to communicate with local residents .
we &apos;re trying to get them to know the benefits of good bugs , to appreciate the incredible creatures and their contribution to nature .
what can you do ? you can do it , you can do it , you can write it to your government and tell them , we need to pay attention to the organisms that are <unk> , and tell the people who are around you .
and when you come out of this room , you &apos;re <unk> , not only to tell your family , but to tell your neighbor about their neighbors .
they &apos;re so elegant . and Charles Darwin once said that he had transformed his own view , and after he saw that the grass was in the air , and gradually it happened .
Kenya , all around the world , would have lost a lot of loss if we lost these wondrous creatures .
thank you very much .
and around us , people around us are able to help us make life better .
we don &apos;t necessarily have to meet our neighbors a lot , so even though we live in a public space , our neighbors &apos; ideas can be transferred to them .
so in the last few years , I &apos;ve been trying to give stickers , different ones , different ones , different pieces , and these simple tools , to share more things with their neighbors .
and these projects came from some of my own questions , like , how much does my neighbor rent ?
how can we take something from our neighborhood and avoid being able to sneak up on the door ?
how can we even share our own memories of being destroyed and better understand the land that we live in ?
how do we express our expectations of what we see and what we expect our communities to reflect our needs and dreams ?
I live in New Orleans and fell in love with this city .
and the giant trees that came after that were filled with my spirit for hundreds of years , and they were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and I believed that there was a city full of music .
I felt like I was running a team in New Orleans .
New Orleans had the most beautiful buildings in the world , but at the same time , she was the most abandoned city in America .
and I live in this neighborhood , and I wanted to see how I could make it a better place in this neighborhood and think about something different , and it changed my life completely .
in 2009 , I lost one of my loved ones .
her name was <unk> , and to me , she was just like my mother , and she died very suddenly , very unexpectedly .
and then I thought a lot about death , and then -- -- -- -- -- -- -- this is what makes me feel good about my time , with the woman , with the <unk> , and seeing the things that are meaningful to my life .
but I was very difficult to maintain this mentality in my daily life .
I felt that people were so easy to remember what was really important .
and so I was able to take this wall of this abandoned house , and I made a giant blackboard on the same page , and before death , I thought , &quot; Well , everybody by the way can pick up a piece of chalk and keep their life in the open .
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , the whole wall was filled and was filled with new answers .
I want to share with you some of the things that people are doing on the wall .
before I die , I want to take a trial for my release .
before I die , I want to cross .
before I die , I want to sing in front of a million people . &quot;
before the death , we have a tree .
before I die , I wanted to live a <unk> life .
before I die , I want to hold her again . &quot;
before I die , I wanted to be a guy .
before I die , I want to be fully true . &quot;
the original building that had forgotten had become a very constructive place , and the hope and dreams made me laugh , and laughing and laughing at the times when I was in my difficulties .
it makes us believe that we are not alone .
let &apos;s take a new paradigm of inspiration for our neighbors .
it &apos;s a space that has enabled us to create a space of reflection and thinking , and it &apos;s also one of the most important things we can do when we grow up .
this blackboard was done last year , and I was getting people to send me advice to people who wanted to build walls in their neighborhood , so my colleagues and I had a small toolbox , and now this wall is all over the world , so Australia , and so on .
and these signs indicate that if we have an opportunity to express our will and share it with others , then public spaces play a huge role .
the most precious and most precious of all , the two things that we have , the time and the connection to each other .
in the midst of this incredible period of time , trying to maintain the self , to remember that the depth of life becomes more important than ever before .
we &apos;re always going to talk about death and death and thinking about dying , but I realized that being one of the most powerful things we can do .
think about death , making you more conscious of your life .
public spaces can be much more important for us , both for our personal sphere , for our community , for our hopes , for our fears , for our experiences , for our experiences , for us to create a better life .
thank you .
thank you .
I spent 50 meters underground in Ghana .
the air is hot , filled with dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
and I could feel the sense of <unk> from people around me , but I couldn &apos;t see anything else .
I hear people talking to each other , but more of them are silent rocks with <unk> tools .
and like everybody else , I had this big <unk> knife on my head with a beat @-@ up truck tied to my neck with branches and holes in the back of the wall , and they held this meter @-@ long <unk> loop loop with this <unk> .
and my hand got over , and immediately came to a miner who he suffered a miner &apos;s hand , and he <unk> his hand .
when I stand here today with you today , the miners who are still in mines like this , there &apos;s no pay , there &apos;s no pay , there &apos;s no subsidies .
and I ended up walking out of mines and going home to the miners who never came home .
in the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been photographing dozens of indigenous cultures , across six continents , and in 2009 , I &apos;ve been very privileged to be independent , to go to the <unk> <unk> at the Vancouver ranks .
and there were a lot of people there that I met , a lot of people that I met , who I met in the <unk> Foundation , who were working to eradicate the modern world .
we talked about slavery , and that &apos;s when I started to really understand the reality of slavery , even though I &apos;ve always known that slavery has nothing to do with it .
and after the conversation ended , I felt really bad , and I felt ashamed of this nasty phenomenon , and I had no idea , I don &apos;t know , how many people are not .
and the idea that I flew in to Los Angeles for a couple of weeks , and I flew to the head of the Red Cross organization and wanted to do something .
and that led to my journey into contemporary art .
oddly enough , I &apos;ve been there .
I &apos;ve got them as my second home .
but this time , I was going to find the secret to see the light @-@ free .
according to conservatives , there are more than 27 million people around the world today .
this number is twice as much as the number of trade @-@ off trade @-@ off across the Atlantic slave trade from Africa .
150 years ago , an average price performance was three times as much as an American business .
that &apos;s 50,000 dollars today .
but today , the price of a family member to slavery may only be 18 dollars .
and what was striking was that the profits of slavery in the world are over 130 billion dollars a year .
many of them have been hijacked by a false commitment to whatever is called an education opportunity , a good job , for free to work and to avoid the threat .
today slavery is about the product of commercial goods , but the people who create value are universal .
it exists in virtually every corner of the world , even though it &apos;s illegal everywhere .
in India and Nepal , I was brought in to <unk> .
it was a very strange sensation , like , going into the <unk> or the <unk> of hell .
men , women , men , women , children , literally hundreds of thousands of tons of dust in the entire family , put bricks on their own heads , and then moved on to 18 yards away from a truck that was hundreds of meters away .
<unk> and tired of just hanging them aside , <unk> them , wrestling , again and again , that same day 16 to 17 hours a day .
you can &apos;t take a break , you can &apos;t eat , you can &apos;t drink it because of extreme water , and they don &apos;t need a toilet .
and because of that fire and dust , my camera <unk> couldn &apos;t work .
every 20 minutes , I had to go back to the car and clean up my equipment , and let it pause at the bottom of the air conditioning , and it would give me a pause , and the camera would be much better than the human being .
and I went back to <unk> , and I wanted to cry , but the <unk> who came to the house quickly settled , and he said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t cry here . &quot;
and then he explained to me that in this place , it was very dangerous , not only for the workers , but for the workers .
I couldn &apos;t give them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money . I couldn &apos;t give them anything .
I &apos;m not a citizen of that country .
my behavior might make them worse than now .
I was expecting the Free <unk> to be able to work within the system so that they could .
and in my case , I had to wait for my family to get this painful .
in the Himalayas , I saw kids doing these rocks , and they &apos;re wearing rocks for a couple of miles along the side of the road .
the kids who beat up the plates , they carry the kids with the sticks , with the rope , with the toys , and they strapped to themselves .
it &apos;s an incredibly painful experience to see this .
how can we intervene in these hidden arguments , but they &apos;re common ?
some people don &apos;t even think they &apos;re doing it on a daily basis , and they don &apos;t do it for hours because they &apos;re born with it .
no comparison .
if these people were to fight for their own freedom , they lit up all their houses .
these people had nothing to do , they were scared , they wanted to give up , but in the middle of the photo , the women shared a lot of money , and they continued to fight back , and now they are doing it for themselves , and they have freedom .
and the reason why I remember this is that most of us , when we hear about slavery , is because all around the world , I was told , if I keep on taking pictures of the industry , it &apos;s not going to be very helpful .
I was rescued by women who were pre @-@ menopausal .
and they took me down the narrow staircase and went into a filthy basement .
it &apos;s not a <unk> .
it &apos;s more like a restaurant .
the balconies were used to be used to be used by the restaurants .
in these little cubicle , sexuality <unk> women and children are only seven @-@ year @-@ olds , getting them to spend more food and wine .
each chamber has a dirty dark , and the number is painted from the ceiling and the curtains .
people who work in this room tend to abuse their victims .
remember , I was standing in the middle of a dark , and I was struck by this moment of fear that I was stuck in this hell .
there &apos;s only one exit : it &apos;s the staircase .
there was no answered .
there &apos;s no window .
these are people who are completely unable to escape , and when we &apos;re confronted with something so difficult , it &apos;s important to know about slavery , including <unk> in our backyard .
there are thousands of restaurants , thousands of restaurants , and there are more than that .
recently , the New York Times ran about 10 to 300,000 children every year , and they were sold as <unk> .
and we just don &apos;t know what happens .
and that &apos;s when we hear about slavery .
I visited a village in India , covered with silk .
this is the portrait of a family . &quot;
the ones that were covered in red , and the blue hand belongs to two sons .
they <unk> it in a <unk> , and then they dip the silk , into it , until the Post @-@ it notes are toxic .
and the translator told me their stories .
we don &apos;t have freedom . they say .
&quot; but we still hope , and God forbid from that room to anywhere else . &quot;
it &apos;s been estimated that there are over 4,000 children who have taken the dams of the <unk> of the world &apos;s biggest <unk> .
we were there , and I went to see this .
I see it as a whole family of two brothers fishing on the boat , some little dots , like ?
wrong . they &apos;re slave slaves .
the kids are buying it from their homes , and they &apos;re buying it on their boat , they &apos;re working on it , they &apos;re not going to swim .
this boy is eight years old .
and as our boats approached the ship , he was shaking on his canoe .
he was scared to fall in the water .
and the branches of the trees that run through the trees are often tied to the nets , the ones that are tired , the ones that get thrown in the water .
a lot of people are drowning .
it was forced to work at a time when he was working .
he was very afraid to run away from his head , because he was treated in the same way as a child .
I saw boys at 5 o &apos;clock in the morning collecting the last net , and they started working in the morning .
it was so cold , it was so cold .
you know , when it &apos;s full of fish , it &apos;s just annoying .
I want to introduce you to what you know .
he got out of a fishing village .
he saw him in a homeless shelter , and the World Trade Center was a place for <unk> victims .
in this photograph , he &apos;s taking a <unk> and <unk> the good news of his head right now , the more <unk> he and his family are , they have been able to make a living for a living and make sure that the child is secure .
there &apos;s a possibility .
and because someone suggested to me , it could change his life .
driving driving a pathway in Ghana , with a partner of the Free Red Cross , with a speeding light truck , <unk> up the window .
and he asked us to do something with him to go to the bush .
at the end of the road , he urged us to get out of the car .
and then he pointed to a series of <unk> , and he said , &quot; Here , that &apos;s the road . walk ! &quot;
we were dragging out the <unk> of the water for about an hour and a half of the water that was recently buried , and I photographed the gear on my head , and I would go down on top of my chest .
and after two hours of <unk> and <unk> , we had a big empty space in front of us , and we had a huge <unk> in every square place .
a lot of women are still carrying their own little child , and they &apos;re walking in the dirty water .
mercury is used for gold .
these people were slavery in another mine in Ghana .
when they come out of mines , they &apos;re full of water .
I remember the eyes of their <unk> , where a lot of them were tired , working in 72 hours .
these rocks are about 90 feet deep , and they &apos;re filled with bags full of thousands of miles , and these rocks are transported to another area , and they &apos;re trucked off .
and as a result , men who hit the ground are robust , but we &apos;ve discovered that some of the workers on the edges are disabled , and some children .
they were victims of nasty violence .
in fact , the men of these muscles , after a few years , were probably as likely to suffer from this guy as mercury and tuberculosis .
this is <unk> . when his father died , his uncle sold him to this mine .
and when his uncle dies , he continues to carry his uncle &apos;s uncle &apos;s uncle , and he &apos;s forced to work on mines .
and when I met him , he had been working on a mining village for about 14 years , and this man was born in an accident , and the doctor said he had an amputation .
apart from this injury , he had tuberculosis , and he had to do it every day .
and even so , he dreamed of free , and then he was able to do this with the freedom of the Free Red Cross to embrace education , which is the belief that there &apos;s an unprecedented amount of suffering .
I want us to give these people the people who are slave @-@ based .
and as I was photographing , I took a lot of candles , I gave them the candle to my photographs , and I wanted to be able to light their stories and their faces when we were safe .
they know these images will be seen from people outside .
and I want them to know that we &apos;re going to make a difference in their lives .
and I really believe that when we think of them as people , it &apos;s very difficult to tolerate the atrocities of slavery .
these images aren &apos;t about issues , they &apos;re about people , and they &apos;re about people , and they &apos;re about to get the same rights , dignity , respect and respect .
I didn &apos;t want these beautiful , but I was surrounded by people who didn &apos;t want to meet them .
and I want these images to be able to evoke a power in the eye of the viewer , and I hope that the forces of this power can be the light of slavery , because there &apos;s no light in the shadows .
thank you .
now , I studied math for everyone who studied mathematics , and there was a special problem for everyone who studied mathematics , which was that we were similar to the management consultant .
nobody knows what we are .
so I &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we do today .
well , dance is one of many human activities .
we were <unk> with <unk> and dance <unk> , and you would know that later .
now ballet needs extraordinary expertise and extraordinary professional skills , even at the outset , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called gift .
but sadly , the nervous system disease , such as Parkinson &apos;s disease , is slowly destroying this extraordinary ability to happen to a friend of mine , <unk> <unk> , who used to be the <unk> of his era .
and for those years , he had a lot of therapy and a lot of progress .
and yet , there &apos;s <unk> million people in the world that have this disease , and they have to endure , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on , that &apos;s why we need an objective tool to test it before we got to the prescription .
we need objective measurements , and ultimately , the only way we want to know when there &apos;s a cure , is that when we have the capability to answer those questions accurately .
but the cause of self @-@ injury is that Parkinson &apos;s , and the rest of the disease , there &apos;s no <unk> , so you can &apos;t do simple blood tests , and the best thing we can do is , like , a 20 @-@ minute neurological test .
you &apos;ve got to get clinics , and it &apos;s fairly expensive , and it means no one &apos;s ever done this before .
but what if the patient could do it at home ?
what if the patient had done it for the patient ?
it doesn &apos;t take a lot of money to hire employees .
by the way , if you go to a neurologist , it costs about 300 dollars .
so I want to propose an alternative approach to you , an approach that we can try to achieve , because you know , in a sense , we &apos;re kind of like my friend <unk> .
I have a video of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is someone in a healthy state , and we think of ourselves as being the voice of sound , because when we hear it , we have to deal with it , and it &apos;s true , for example , genes that are born .
and again , again , this requires training .
think about it . how long would it take ?
from the sound , we can go to the position of <unk> , where the Parkinson &apos;s disease can influence us , and it can affect us all the time .
you can see the <unk> on the bottom , which is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we saw the same symptoms .
voices <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
speech will become <unk> , and then with even more <unk> , these are symptoms .
in fact , the sound of most of the sound is elusive , but as long as you have a digital mic on it , you have a sophisticated voice analysis , and you combine it with a very modern machine research , we can now be able to measure precisely where other people are healthy and disease in a straight line , and this is just a sign of speech .
so what do they do with speech @-@ based testing , and what do they do with specialized clinical trial ? they &apos;re all <unk> .
neuroscience testing is <unk> , and they use existing infrastructure .
you don &apos;t need to design a new set of hospitals to do it .
they all have precision , and they &apos;re not experts on speech levels .
that means you can do it yourself .
and it &apos;s going fast , and it &apos;s going to take about 30 seconds .
the price was low , and we knew how to do it .
and once it &apos;s cheap , it can be scaled up massively .
I &apos;ve got some of the great goals out here .
we can reduce the number of questions with patients .
there &apos;s no need to go to the clinic and do routine checks .
we can monitor objective data using simple data .
we can do a lot of damage to a clinical trial , a very low @-@ volume , and we can actually demonstrate that at the very first time .
we also had the opportunity to start looking for this kind of illness , the early <unk> of life .
so , from the beginning of today &apos;s journey , the first step in this direction , we started <unk> &apos;s <unk> program .
working with <unk> and <unk> , we would like to record enough data from all over the world to get these four goals .
our <unk> number connected to seven million people on the planet .
anyone who has a healthy or a Parkinson &apos;s disease can come in , it &apos;s cheap , it &apos;s cheap to keep a record , and every time I get a little bit of money , I &apos;m glad to announce that we &apos;re only at eight hours .
thank you .
Max , based on these samples , can you tell who is healthy , who is the disease ?
what do you want to do with these specimens ?
yes , yes . so this is what you call a call , you have to tell us if you have this disease . <unk> : mmm .
you know , some people might not call us , or aren &apos;t connected .
but we &apos;re still going to get samples from different environments , and the point is that different environments , because we can eliminate the causes of these <unk> , and we can actually look for the disease .
so you &apos;ve got about 86 percent accurate now ?
it &apos;s gone .
in fact , my students didn &apos;t read it , and I had to mention that he was doing some pretty good work , and now he proved that the mobile phone could do this online project , so we &apos;re now approaching 99 percent accuracy .
okay , that &apos;s pretty cool .
so it also means that people can -- people can use their mobile phone to call in your phone and then do this test , so they can tap into the phone and record the voice , and then the doctors can check out what they &apos;re doing , and they &apos;re pretty much where they &apos;re going .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much , Max and all of them .
thank you .
I &apos;ve been fascinated by photography since I &apos;ve been camera enough , but I &apos;d like to share with you 15 pictures of what I love most , none of which I ever photographed .
there &apos;s no artistic director , there &apos;s no opportunity , there &apos;s no hope , let &apos;s forget .
in fact , most of them took a random sample .
my story at a time when I spoke at a time in New York City , and my wife took a picture , and I was on her daughter &apos;s birthday , her first birthday , and we stood on the <unk> Street and the fifth floor .
and a year later , we went back to New York , so we decided to take a picture of the same .
you can guess what happened .
and when my daughter was three , her wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you ever call back to New York ? do you carry this little tour ? &quot;
and it was taken from people who started our way .
you know , taking the camera to a total stranger is common and unusual .
no one &apos;s going to refuse , and fortunately no one &apos;s going to take our cameras out .
and we didn &apos;t know that this journey was going to change our lives deeply .
it became sacred to us .
this was taken a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and I was trying to explain what was going on that day when 9 / 11 was trying to figure out what was going to happen .
so these pictures are far more than just documenting a moment , or a very special journey .
they &apos;re the ones that remember our time in the last 10 months , and let &apos;s think about the years , and how we changed , not just the changes in our bodies , but the changes in our bodies .
because I took the same photographs every year , our views were different , and my daughter came to a new milestone , and I watched through her eyes , and she looked at everything .
this is the time that we spent on a year , the most anticipated time .
and recently , we walked on our way , and she stopped , and she pointed at the red shoe store and she said she loved her baby .
she told me when she was five years old , and she was standing on that photo .
she said she remembered the first time she saw her heart jump , and that was nine years ago .
now she went to New York to look at college campuses , because she decided to go to New York .
and I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is our memories .
so I &apos;d like to share with you this idea of actively creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but I personally , I don &apos;t know if there are 15 pictures of your family .
I always took that photo .
I would like to encourage all of you in this room to go out and take photos , don &apos;t you know , go to the front lines , go get us photographed ? &quot;
thank you .
