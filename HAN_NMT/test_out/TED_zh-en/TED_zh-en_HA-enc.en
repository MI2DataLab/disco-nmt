one day , the Los Angeles Times , Steve <unk> on the streets of Los Angeles , had a wonderful piece of music .
music is a man , African @-@ American man , a very glamorous man , a man who has two strings of strings .
now , I want to tell you about this story , and many of you already know that because Steve &apos;s column , he turned out to be a book @-@ based , and then Robert <unk> , who played <unk> for Nathaniel , who was a double <unk> at the Juilliard School of Justice , and he suffered from schizophrenia .
Nathaniel <unk> dropped out from the Juilliard School , who had lost his completely 30 years later on on the streets of Los Angeles .
and I encourage all of you to look at Steve &apos;s books , or look at the movies , not only to understand the beauty of these two men and women , but also to see that music is the most useful tool for creating this kind of ties .
I met Mr. <unk> , in 2008 , two years ago in the Disney Hall .
he listened to Beethoven &apos;s first , and the fourth symphony came upon himself .
and he talked a lot , a lot of <unk> , and he talked about <unk> and Hillary Clinton , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s no way that you can get into the World Series , and it happened because of the Beethoven &apos;s <unk> <unk> of the fourth orchestra . &quot;
and we talked a little bit about music . and a few days later , I got Steve letters from Nathaniel who was interested in playing with me .
and what I should mention is that Nathaniel refused treatment , because what he was given was the treatment of the shocks and the doors that stayed in his life .
and as a result , his schizophrenia now became even more difficult , and the worst act of his own encounter was that he would disappear from a couple of days on the streets of Skid Row , through the fears of the psyche .
Nathaniel was just a state in which we started in the Disney Hall hall for the first grade in his eyes , and he was a lost man .
he mentioned the invisible devil and the smoke , and how someone could sleep for him when he was asleep .
I was scared not to worry about my own security , but to be afraid that I would lose him , and he would sink into one of his states , and I would destroy his relationship with the violin , and if I started talking about <unk> and other forms of chess .
so I started <unk> .
I played Beethoven &apos;s <unk> .
and when I was playing , I knew there was a change in Nathaniel &apos;s eye .
it &apos;s like he &apos;s catching something that &apos;s invisible , it &apos;s like having it through chemistry , and that &apos;s the catalyst for it .
his voice is <unk> , and he converted into quiet curiosity and elegance .
and the magic is , he picks up his violin , and he starts playing with some of the pieces of <unk> , and then he &apos;s going to do it again , and he picks it up .
and so we started talking about music : from Bach to Beethoven , <unk> , all of the names started with B.
and I realized that he wasn &apos;t just a piece of music , but he was able to connect it to him .
he talked about the passion and the deep understanding of the music as I was talking to the folks in Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra .
by playing music , talking about music , this guy has moved from a <unk> , <unk> , a homeless man in Los Angeles , and a fabulous musician who has become a musician in music music education .
music is medicine . music is transforming us .
music is helping him turn on .
because music can help him turn his imagination into reality .
and that &apos;s what helped him out of his suffering .
and I know this is the art form .
and that &apos;s why we create music , that &apos;s why we all have an internal core of what each of us has , and that our feelings , through our art lens , through our creativity , shape reality .
and this kind of expression of reality is bringing us all together , inspire us .
and he took him back to a group of friends .
the power of music is bringing him back to the home of the music community , where people understand his talents .
and I would always create music for him , whether it &apos;s on the streets of Walt Disney , or on the streets of Skid Row , because he suggested to me why I wanted to be a musician .
thank you .
LP : thank you . thank you .
Robert Full .
Robert Full : now I &apos;m going to play you a piece of music that I memorized from the <unk> .
so please forgive me .
I &apos;ve had a lot of fish in my life .
only two are my favorites .
the first one is passion .
it &apos;s a beautiful fish , <unk> , texture , rich , the most popular fish on the menu .
what a beautiful fish !
and the better thing is , it &apos;s driven by the highest standards , and it &apos;s sustainable .
and the people who sell him are feeling sick .
and I had this beautiful relationship that went on for about a few months .
and one day , the top telephone of this company called me invited me to join an initiative and the agricultural development of fisheries .
and I said , &quot; Absolutely not . &quot;
and this company is trying to figure out a question for our chef : how do we leave the fish on the menus ? <unk> .
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing from all over the ocean like frozen trees .
no , it &apos;s a disruptive .
ninety @-@ nine percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , they go extinct .
almost nothing left .
so , whether it &apos;s good or bad or evil , it &apos;s going to be a part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of talk about this industry , and they &apos;re mostly about <unk> and effective , like tuna .
the feed of the tuna is 15 .
and what that means is that every single one pound of tuna is 15 pounds of feed on other wild fish .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
and it &apos;s not delicious .
and finally , this company wanted to do something right .
and I want to support them .
and the day before that , I was contacted by the PR department for companies .
let &apos;s call him &quot; <unk> for Men . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Don Burke , by the way , which I know is true , is that you &apos;re famous in the sea of fish , and you don &apos;t get pollution . &quot;
and he responded to what you &apos;re talking about . we &apos;re far away from our work , and what we &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s been diluted out , and it &apos;s not going to be concentrated .
and then he added it to us , and we &apos;re like , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
feed the feed ? two and a half , and he said .
the best in the <unk> industry .
it &apos;s two and a half times better than one .
what &apos;s two and a half ? what are you looking for ?
and he said , &quot; Well , sustainable protein . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s pretty cool . &quot; and then the phone comes in .
and as a result , I was lying in bed and thinking , &quot; What is a hell of a living protein ? &quot;
so the next day , just before that incident , I phoned her .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t do you have any examples of sustainable protein ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would go and ask people around .
and then I got a little bit of phone calls from this company , but no one could give me a clear answer , until the end , they &apos;re experts in biology .
let me tell you , let &apos;s call him up for a seven @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t fight for a male or two , would you like to have a sustainable protein ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he mentioned the following .
and I asked the question , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; <unk> are feathers , <unk> , bone , waste , dry and then dry the dry season . &quot;
I said , what percentage of the chicken is in the feed ?
think about it , you know , two percent .
and he said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s about 30 percent .
and I said , &quot; Don &apos;t cut , man @-@ made , man @-@ made , this is what sustainable ? &quot;
there was silence over a long period of time , and he said to me , &quot; The world is so much chicken . &quot;
so I stopped loving this fish .
no , not because I &apos;m a self @-@ righteous , <unk> .
and I was like that .
no , I no longer love this fish anymore , because I swear to God that after that dialogue , it became more like a chicken .
the second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s that romance , the more you know your fish , the more you love it .
I first eaten this fish in a restaurant , in southern Spain .
a long time ago a journalist and I said this .
she could say it was a <unk> .
that fish lights up on the table , that white light .
chef cooking it for a while .
it &apos;s like cooking twice .
but it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s delicious .
who can do this kind of nice fish and do it in cooking time ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him <unk> . his name is <unk> .
but he didn &apos;t cook that fish , he wasn &apos;t a chef , at least in the way you understand it .
he &apos;s a biologist at the <unk> Valley .
he &apos;s a <unk> in Spain .
he was right on the bank of the river .
and it wasn &apos;t until the late 1980s , that this is the <unk> of Argentina .
they were there at that time , and this was basically wetlands .
they pull out the water .
and then they built a series of complex canals , and they put the water in there .
but they didn &apos;t succeed , I mean economics .
and the conditions around the world are causing tremendous disasters .
almost 90 percent of all the birds around the world are gone , and in this area there are a lot of birds .
and then in 1982 , a Spanish company that has taken this picture .
what did they do ?
they reverse the flow .
they &apos;re basically <unk> .
instead of using <unk> , they used the <unk> to bring water back .
they filled it with water .
and then there was a <unk> acres -- <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and in this case , <unk> , <unk> , and this company , completely saved the landscape .
and it was phenomenal .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
and I looked at the horizon as a kind of <unk> , and you come up with a channel of water that &apos;s been pulled out of the water and the wetlands of it .
not too long ago , I was there .
he &apos;s a remarkable man , and he &apos;s a Darwinian , a quarter of a crocodile .
we went into the wetlands , and I was an <unk> , and we had lost our knee , and we had the <unk> storytelling .
and here , he points to a very rare , black <unk> .
this is , he talked about the carbon fiber of the breed .
and here , he saw a set of patterns that would allow you to get the giraffe of Tanzania .
as a result , <unk> had spent a long time working in African National Park .
and I asked him how he became a fish expert .
he said , &quot; <unk> fish ? I don &apos;t know them . &quot;
I &apos;m just an expert on <unk> .
and then he started talking more about rare birds and algae and different frogs .
please don &apos;t get me wrong , and that conversation really is about some kind of thing .
that &apos;s good , but I fell in love .
and there was still a catch in my mind that I had over @-@ <unk> delicious fish .
so I quit him . I said , &quot; <unk> , what makes your fish sweet ? &quot;
he pointed to the algae .
and I knew that the brothers , the algae , the plants , the plants , the things that matter .
but what do you eat ?
what &apos;s the feed ? what &apos;s the feed ?
and then he went on to tell me that this is a very productive system , and what these fish were eating in the wild .
plant organisms , carbon dioxide , plankton , plankton , phytoplankton , feed fish .
it &apos;s a very healthy system , and it &apos;s completely self @-@ updates .
no feed .
have you ever heard about a farm that doesn &apos;t feed animals ?
and later on that day , I was driving around with <unk> , and I asked him , &quot; How do you measure success ? &quot;
it was then , as if there was a film director suddenly asking for change .
we turn around and see the most beautiful picture , thousands of pink <unk> , which is a pink carpet .
and he said , &quot; That &apos;s success . &quot;
look at their belly , pink .
they &apos;re enjoying their <unk> .
have I completely degraded ?
I said , &quot; Look , <unk> , they &apos;re not your fish ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; He said .
birds will eat 20 percent of our fish and fish .
and last year , this fishery had <unk> , over 250 different species .
today , this has become one of the largest and most important and most important private birds in Europe .
I said , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; so many birds don &apos;t want to be the <unk> ? &quot;
no , he didn &apos;t .
he said , &quot; We are a general raise , not deliberate . &quot;
this is an ecological network .
and they eat shrimp .
shrimp eat <unk> .
so the more their stomach was bright , the more the pink they were , the better the system was .
all right , let &apos;s take a look at it . a farm does not feed its animal , and it estimates its success as natural predators .
a <unk> , also a bird shelter .
and , by the way , those <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t be there .
they breed in cities , and they live 150 miles away , and the soil is much more potent .
every morning , they fly 150 miles to this fisheries .
and at night , they were flying 150 miles .
and they did this because they could follow a white line on the freeway .
no joke .
I &apos;ve always imagined things like &quot; The <unk> diary , &quot; and I looked at the island .
I said , Lewis <unk> , they fly 150 miles to get the logging , and they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do it for kids ? don &apos;t they do it .
and he looked at me like I had just quoted in Houston .
and he said , &quot; Well , they &apos;re not . they &apos;re doing it because it &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t mention the <unk> of my favorite fish , which is really delicious , and I don &apos;t usually like <unk> . I don &apos;t like <unk> .
it has <unk> , like tar .
I never did it with the fish .
but when I was in the southern part of Spain , it didn &apos;t taste like a <unk> .
it tasted cold and clean , and it tastes as if you had a good part of the skin .
and I talked to him about my idea , and he was very impressed .
he said , &quot; It &apos;s like a sponge . &quot;
it &apos;s the final line that prevents matter from getting into the body .
and the effect of it is to absorb the <unk> .
and then he went on and said , &quot; But we don &apos;t have water in our waters . &quot;
okay . a <unk> does not feed its fish . a fishery measuring its success is due to its natural predators .
and then I realized that when he said that there was no <unk> , he said that , because water rushing through the fisheries , it came from tall <unk> .
and that river contains all of the stuff that &apos;s in the river right now , chemical pollutants , keep up .
and when it gets to the system , the water will get warmer than it does .
it &apos;s a very dry system , and it can filter water here .
so , this fishery is not just about feeding animals , it &apos;s not just about measuring its success , it &apos;s based on its natural habitat , but it &apos;s about a fishery , and it &apos;s not just for you and me .
because when water leaves here , it runs into the Atlantic .
I know it &apos;s a very small part of it , but I appreciate it , and you should , because it &apos;s a love story , not only romance , but it &apos;s educational .
you might say it &apos;s the future food diet , whether we &apos;re talking about beef or beef .
what we need now is a whole new conception of agriculture , a real food .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s pretty extreme .
we &apos;re not a realist . we &apos;re a love guy .
we love the market . we love small farms . we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
and then when you suggest that this food will guarantee the future of the future , someone stands up somewhere and says , &quot; Man , I love the pink , but how do you make the world fill up ?
how do you feed the world ? &quot;
can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t like your problem .
no , not just because we &apos;ve produced far more calories than we need in the world .
one billion people today are still in a state .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever -- the root of the whole thing is not balanced , not by the way .
and the real reason I don &apos;t like this is because he put up a food system , a logic that exists in the last 50 years .
bring grain to the soil , bring it to the species , give it to the soil , give it to the fish , and agriculture can simply ask , what if we feed more people , what &apos;s wrong ?
that &apos;s an incentive . it has made sense . it &apos;s a business plan that belongs to American agriculture .
we should point out that its true , a business that was <unk> , an ecological capital that made it possible .
it &apos;s not a business . it &apos;s not a agriculture .
our food is under threat today , not because of the supply chain , but because of the resources available at the moment .
it wasn &apos;t invented by the latest <unk> technology or the invention of a tractor , but it was fertile soil , not by pump water , but by fresh water , not by the way , by the way , by the way , from the burning of the fish in the ocean .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking , how do we feed ourselves ?
or better yet , how do we create an environment where it can feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t expect the future of agriculture models .
it &apos;s obsolete , and it &apos;s tired .
because it relies too much on capital , chemistry , machines , and it doesn &apos;t really produce good foods .
instead , let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s been around for two billion years and a half billion years .
look at farmers like <unk> . look at farmers like <unk> .
instead of just their own farm , it self @-@ sufficiency , and it &apos;s not about consumption , it &apos;s not about the farm , it &apos;s not about the farm , it &apos;s not just about the farmer , it &apos;s about the farmer .
because they &apos;re experts in the taste .
and if I want to be honest , they &apos;re better than I am .
you know , I completely agree with this , because if the future of good food is so good , they would be delicious .
thank you .
and if I want to leave you with one today , that is that all of the data that we consume has a lot of information in the world , and that is that all the data that we consume has a lot more information , and that is the sum of all the data that we consume , and that information that doesn &apos;t happen .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death chart as age .
the tool I use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and I can use filter and filter for a particular cause , like an accident .
immediately , I saw a different model .
and that &apos;s because , in the middle , people are living in the middle of their time , and they &apos;re here , they &apos;re the ones where they &apos;re most prolific .
we can reconstruct the data by dying , and we can see that recycling data is a major condition for dying , but it doesn &apos;t really work for everyone .
if we filter it up , like 40 years old , we can see that it &apos;s become a disaster for people to take care of .
and if you dig further , it turns out that this one is particularly true for men .
all right , you probably know that this tool has worked in this way to look at information , and the data is very much like a living picture .
if we could do this with the raw data , why not do it on the content ?
so we &apos;re showing here every single issue of history on this cover .
all over here , all on the Web .
you can go back to your room after I finished .
you can look at it in 10 years .
you can dive into a year .
you can go directly into one issue .
I saw this ; I saw people who had come out of this room , sports .
I &apos;m a fan of Lance Armstrong , and so I &apos;m going to click on it and show me that all of this is just part of Karen Armstrong .
now , if I just wanted to sample the peak of the data , I would think , well , what about all the bike athletes ?
so I can step back and scale this up .
I saw Greg <unk> .
so you have to understand that when you look at information in this weird way , broad , backwards , you &apos;re not search , you &apos;re not browsing .
what you do is actually slightly different .
and in between , and we think it changes the way information is used .
so I came up with something a little bit crazy about this idea .
what we &apos;re doing here is we &apos;re going to just pull out every Wikipedia page and then we &apos;re going to compress it down to a little <unk> .
and the quote contains a quote from a field of expertise .
I &apos;m just showing you 500 of the most popular Wikipedia pages .
but even in these limited browsing , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we learned what &apos;s most popular in Wikipedia .
I continue and select government .
now , through chosen government , I can see that the most frequent <unk> of Wikipedia is Time magazine .
and that &apos;s important , because this is not a content of any <unk> site .
only if you step back and look at the big picture , you can see it .
take a look at one of these special <unk> , and then I can dive into the magazine spending time .
so , looking at these guys , I could see a lot of them from government . some of them come from the scientific world . fewer of them come from business . one of them comes from Connecticut .
and what &apos;s interesting is that the <unk> are also the great TED Prize .
so we can continue , <unk> , and look at all the TED Prize winner .
so you see , this is the first time we &apos;re running through the network as if it &apos;s a web , not just a page , but on a much higher level of governance .
so I want to tell you about another thing that might surprise you .
I &apos;m just showing you the New York Times website .
the <unk> , the app -- I don &apos;t want to call it the browser , but it &apos;s actually a browser , and you can browse the page -- and we introduced every website like this to a site like this , and we gave it back to every website like this .
so I could step back and get back to a specific place .
and why this is important is because I can see my entire history through this medium , through this way .
so I can dive into specific events .
in fact , it &apos;s all I &apos;ve shown you here .
I could sort of <unk> what I saw earlier today .
if I wanted to step back and look at what I could do , I could cut my history , maybe my search history . here , I did some search @-@ and @-@ rescue search , <unk> , where the Microsoft <unk> were .
and from that , I could go into the pages and just ask them .
and this is the same information , because different goals are used multiple times , <unk> each time , making it more information than the sum of the parts . every time it <unk> , it <unk> the overall information .
now , in this world , we talk about data often about this curse .
we talked about the explosion of information .
we &apos;re talking about buried in the ocean .
suppose we can turn this idea around and turn the web up and down , and in contrast to each other &apos;s links , let &apos;s start to look at the kinds of connections , the links , and then see the hidden patterns , the hidden patterns , and then see the patterns , the hidden away , the pattern ?
if we can do that , instead of being stuck in the data , we can actually get access to information .
and not only processing information , we can also tease out knowledge .
if we get knowledge , then we can even find intelligence .
thank you .
I grew up with science fiction .
when I was in high school , I went back to school every day .
in the long @-@ term drive , I &apos;ve been immersed in the book , and the science fiction brought my ideas into other worlds , and in narrative , I was very curious about that .
besides , I was also curious to see in other respects : whenever I don &apos;t need a class , I always go to the trees , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the research underneath the microscope .
I was like a science <unk> .
but it &apos;s all about trying to understand the world , about the possibilities .
and I also responded to science fiction as well as the world around me , because it was the late &apos; 60s , and the man started to dive into the deep sea .
Jacques <unk> put his amazing visual effects into our lives and showed us the animals and the landscape and the beautiful world .
all of this seems to resonate with science fiction .
at the same time , I was an artist .
I could paint .
and I also found that because there were no video games or special effects on video games , and there were huge <unk> in the media business , I had to create these images in my mind .
and believe that all of us , as young as I were , tend to be able to play a film about the author in our brains .
and my response to that is to look at alien creatures , alien world , robotics , spacecraft , and so on .
I was hiding the textbook in the back of the textbook , and the graffiti comes in .
and as a result , I had to ask other ways of asking for my creativity .
interestingly , the Jacques <unk> film struck me that there was a alien world on this Earth .
I may not have been able to actually go to the alien world in my lifetime , which sounds too painful .
but there &apos;s a world that really exists on the planet where I can go -- the <unk> and the <unk> , the things that I imagined through books .
so in the year of my 15 year , I decided to become a divers .
but the only problem was , I lived in a small village in Canada , and the nearest sea was 600 miles away .
but I didn &apos;t do it .
and I repeated my father , until he found a dive in New York where I found a diving tree , and it was on the other side of the border .
and as a result , in a pool of water in a pool of water , I got my dive certificate .
but in the next two years , I witnessed the sea , until we moved to California .
over the next 40 years , I spent approximately 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours in the submersible .
and I found that in the deep sea -- even the shallow water -- it &apos;s filled with amazing life , far beyond our imagination .
and the imagination of nature is far beyond our narrow imagination .
and it wasn &apos;t until today when I saw anything that I &apos;d seen .
my love of the ocean has not changed .
but when I got bored , I picked up the movie .
and it seemed to me that this was the best way to combine my storytelling and to create imagery .
as a child , I always paint cartoons .
and the movie made exactly the same imagery and the stories together , and then of course it will happen .
and of course , the stories I &apos;ve been telling are stories of science fiction , &quot; The Terminator , &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; The <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; The <unk> , &quot; I combine my love of the deep sea and the movies .
divide two passions , combine them .
and this brings up another kind of perspective , which is to create the narrative model for the better , to create the fluid from the film , we start using computer animation techniques .
the first mechanical people in the computer were created in the first place .
and while that movie happened , it happened to be back to the scene , and I saw this incredible scene -- the magic of the global audiences all over the world .
and that &apos;s what Arthur C. Clarke , whose technology and magic are not separate from .
and what the audience saw was this magic .
this blew my mind .
and I thought , &quot; Oh my God , this technology needs to be a big part of the movie . &quot;
so in my next movie , &quot; Terminator 2 , &quot; we pushed this technology to the new stairs .
by working with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , we created the liquid metal guy in the film , and the success of the movie depends on whether this technology works .
it worked . we made the magic again . we got the same feedback from the audience , but that movie was a little bit better .
together with these two experiences , we realized that this could be a new world , a new world for the artists to play with their imagination .
so I started a company with my friends , <unk> <unk> , the name of the company , <unk> and <unk> .
and the idea of companies is to develop a model of the past <unk> and so forth , directly into digital manufacturing .
in fact , we did . and we did .
but in the mid @-@ 1990s , we discovered that even though companies were designed to be biologically @-@ designed , there was a solution to this .
so I created this work called &quot; The <unk> , &quot; which is going to push the visual impact of the computer and the computer , using computer animation to create creatures that live in real human emotions , and the main character will be made by the computer .
but I touched the computer . and the people in our company told me we couldn &apos;t do this kind of thing at the time .
so I took this idea and put it in , and I made a film about the sea floor .
and I was talking to the film companies that this film was going to be the <unk> and <unk> of the boat , and it would be a beautiful , romantic film .
but my real motive was to go and visit the Titanic .
that &apos;s why I made that movie .
I mean , the truth is , but the movie company didn &apos;t know .
and I persuaded them . I said , &quot; Look , we &apos;re going to dive in the field , we &apos;re going to go into the field . &quot;
as the start of the film .
it &apos;s a very important , very theater .
so I persuaded them to invest in an adventure .
it sounds crazy . but it ends up being about creating a reality if you use your imagination .
in fact , we did create a reality six months later in the North Atlantic -- I was at two and a half miles underwater in a Russian submersible , in a Russian submersible , looking at the Titanic .
it &apos;s not a film , it &apos;s not a high @-@ definition , it &apos;s a reality .
and I was pretty struck by that experience .
and the early days of the project were really bright , and we needed to build cameras , lighting , etc .
but what really struck me was that these deep dives , like the universe exploration .
both of them are high @-@ tech product , and both of them need critical deployment .
you walk into this dark , dark environment , and if you don &apos;t rely on your own power to return , you don &apos;t have any potential for a rescue .
and I thought , &quot; Oh my God . I was like being in a science paper . &quot;
that &apos;s pretty cool . <unk> !
and as a result , the deep sea exploration became my new passion .
and of course , it comes down to this idea of wonder , of science , of course , of all things , of course , of search for the unknown , of curiosity , of imagination .
Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me a lot of experience .
I could imagine a creature and use computer special effects to create it , but I couldn &apos;t imagine the day I saw through the diving window .
and in the course of our expedition , I &apos;ve looked at life in the hydrothermal vent , and sometimes I &apos;ve never seen anything that I &apos;ve never seen before , and sometimes it &apos;s not even something that no one &apos;s ever looked at before , even something that we were exposed to before .
and as a result , I was <unk> all the time .
so I made this amazing decision .
after the &quot; Titanic &quot; became successful , I decided , &quot; All right , I &apos;ve made movies in Hollywood , and here it is , and over the next period of time , I &apos;m going to become an explorer . &quot;
so we started thinking about these adventures .
we went to the <unk> , and we used robotic devices to detect its debris .
we then went back to the ruins of Titanic .
and they created a bunch of robots that could contain optical fibers .
the goal is to dive into the wreckage and to explore inside of it -- an unprecedented act .
before , no one had looked at the wreckage . they didn &apos;t have the technology needed , so we created the technology .
you know , I was on the deck of the Titanic , sitting in a submersible , looking at the deck of the ship , thinking of the band that was performed here .
I was manipulating a little robot expedition down the corridor of the <unk> .
even though I &apos;m manipulating it , my mind is still in this quest .
I felt that I was actually on the wreckage of the Titanic .
and that &apos;s the most incredible thing that I &apos;ve ever met with , because I &apos;ve been walking around with the light of the robot , and I &apos;ve learned everything hidden away from every corner , and the reason is because in the process of making films , I spent a lot of months in this scene .
and the actual model for the painting is a real model made by this ship .
so it was extraordinary .
it allowed me to experience a distance @-@ surveillance experience -- and we even had these robots in the form , and we inject them into a different form .
it &apos;s a profound feeling .
maybe this makes us wonder what the world will look like in the next few decades , as a science community , and I can imagine the future of human society , using half @-@ machine machines to do exploration and other activities .
so through these expeditions , I really began to look at the beauty of the sea , the amazing creatures that live in the deep sea , they &apos;re going to be alien creatures on the planet .
they live in a chemical <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t really require light from the sun .
so when you look at the animals living at 500 degrees below the sea floor .
you think they &apos;re not going to survive .
and at the same time , I became interested in the space technology of space , and this was also the result of science fiction .
and as a result , I set up a very tight connection with the space community , with the United States <unk> , to become part of the research board , to actually engineer the space mission , to go to Russia , to go to the <unk> agreement , to see a series of things , so we took our 3D gear .
this experience is pretty impressive .
but what I ended up doing was trying to convince space scientists to follow us in the deep ocean .
allow them to experience that . space biologists , <unk> , etc . , etc .
so what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re working on the science research at the same time .
and I &apos;ve connected it as a science experience as a child .
and I learned a lot about this journey .
I learned a lot about science , but I also learned a lot about leadership .
you felt that the director had to be a leader , a leadership , a <unk> .
but before these trips , I knew nothing about leaders .
because I had to ask myself , what was I doing ?
why do I do this ? what do I get out of it ?
these damn documentaries don &apos;t make any money .
we don &apos;t want to be easy . we don &apos;t want to be healthy .
a lot of people think that I &apos;m between the Titanic and the movie &quot; The <unk> , &quot; just sitting on the beach .
but in fact , I made these films , and there were very few of them .
<unk> , no money . what are you doing ?
and I do this for the value of this experience , and the world is the most challenging environment , and I do all of this to explore , and to find the wonder that a small group of people collide with a very tight team .
because every time we work with 10 to 12 people , sometimes for two or three months at sea .
and the most important thing that you realize in that kind of <unk> is that you live with one another , and you live in a task that cannot explain to other people .
when you go back to the coast , you say , &quot; We need to do this , this optical fibers , this <unk> , this <unk> , and that . the productivity of their technology , the productivity of their homework -- these are the ones that you can &apos;t explain to other people , and they &apos;re the ones who haven &apos;t explained to them .
create a cohesion , creating a cohesive <unk> .
so when I came back to make my next film , &quot; <unk> , &quot; I tried to apply the same principles of leadership -- respect your team , and they <unk> you back .
and it really changed the dynamic of the team .
I went back to work with a small team to create new technologies that didn &apos;t exist .
exciting .
it &apos;s full of challenges .
in four and a half years , we become a community .
it changed the way I made movies .
people review this : you bring the sea organisms back to people &apos;s field and put them on the planet .
and for me , it &apos;s more about the laws and the processes that make things change .
so what did we get from all this ?
what have you learned ?
I think the first is curiosity .
this is the most powerful thing you have .
imagination is a force that reflects reality .
and your team is more important than all the rest of the world .
and sometimes the young director would ask me , &quot; Your Honor for some of the films . &quot;
and my answer was , don &apos;t stay with you .
other people are going to be limiting you , but you don &apos;t want to limit yourself . don &apos;t make sure you lose yourself . don &apos;t make sure you lose yourself . don &apos;t make sense .
there &apos;s a quote from the United States , which they love : it &apos;s not an option . it &apos;s not an option .
but in art and exploration , failure must be an option , because it requires a challenge .
none of the important efforts to create innovation are done without risk .
you have to take those risks .
and that &apos;s what I want to leave you with : whatever you do , failure is one of those options , but fear is not . thank you .
what I want to talk about today is energy and climate , it may be a little bit unexpected .
what I want to talk to you about today is energy and climate , and it may be surprising that , after all , my full @-@ time job at the Foundation is to take care of the disease and the agricultural output of the poorest two billion people in the world .
but in fact , energy and climate are particularly important to these people , and in fact , it &apos;s more important than the rest of the world , but in fact , energy and climate are more important than the rest of the world .
climate degradation means that their crops will not grow for years , and that means they will continue to grow or drought , which means that their crops will not grow up for years , and that means that they will be vulnerable to withstand changes , that will not survive .
it would cause famine , it would cause a social riots .
so , climate change is going to bring people back to life , and it &apos;s important for them .
so , climate change is going to bring people back to life , and it &apos;s important for them .
in fact , if you just reduce the price of something down to poverty , you &apos;d be very likely to be very expensive , and in fact , if you only reduce the price of something down to poverty , you &apos;d be very likely to end up getting the price .
and as humans come down from history , modern civilization is based on advanced energy .
and as humans come down from history , modern civilization is based on advanced energy .
the coal revolution in those days flew into the industrial revolution , and in the beginning of the 20th century , we had falling very fast , and that was the reason why we could enjoy the refrigerator air conditioning in the early 20th century , and in the early 1900s , we were able to enjoy the reason why we were enjoying our refrigerator air conditioning , and we were able to do all kinds of things .
because of electricity , we can live in a rich world .
but when we lower the flow of carbon , let &apos;s say twice as cheap as we make it , we have a new limitation , and we have a new limit on CO2 , and we have a new limit on CO2 .
carbon dioxide is causing global warming , and the calculations for carbon dioxide emissions are actually very simple , and carbon dioxide is turning global warming around , and the calculations of CO2 emissions are actually very simple .
the CO2 emissions today are going to cause the temperature to rise , and the great CO2 emissions are going to cause the temperature to rise up , and the consequences of a very harsh effect , whether it &apos;s directly affected by the weather , or the effects of the ecosystem , or the effects of the effects of the ecosystem .
what &apos;s the combination of CO2 increases and temperature ? what &apos;s the combination of carbon dioxide ? why is it increasing and the temperature of carbon dioxide ? what &apos;s the combination of carbon dioxide ?
there &apos;s a lot of downsides to global warming , and it &apos;s not completely certain , but it &apos;s certainly too severe to global warming , and it &apos;s certainly not very sure , but it &apos;s certainly pretty severe .
and I &apos;ve been asked several times to ask the best scientists : do we really have to reduce CO2 emissions down to zero ?
reduced to less than half , or maybe a quarter .
and the answer is , unless we fall to zero , the temperature goes up , and that will be a huge challenge , and their answer is , unless we fall to zero , the temperature will rise up .
and the answer is , unless we get zero , the temperature goes up , and that &apos;s a huge challenge .
it &apos;s not like a 12 @-@ foot truck passed 10 @-@ foot bridge , and if you want to get it right , it &apos;s not like getting a 12 @-@ foot truck by 10 feet of the bridge , as long as you can .
carbon dioxide emissions are completely down to zero .
and we &apos;re generating a lot of CO2 per year , more than four billion tons of CO2 per year , and we &apos;re releasing a lot of CO2 per year .
there are about 20 tons of poverty in the United States , and there &apos;s less than a ton per person , and there &apos;s about five tons of global CO2 emissions , about 20 tons per person , and there &apos;s less than a ton per capita to about five tons .
there are about 20 tons of poverty in the United States , and there are about five tons per person per person .
anyway , we &apos;re all going to make a difference , until we drop that number down to zero , and we &apos;re all going to make a difference , until we get that number down to zero .
and the numbers are still going up , and there &apos;s only a few points left to suppress the momentum .
the numbers are still going up , and there &apos;s only a few degrees left to suppress the momentum , and we &apos;re going to stop it from going up , and we &apos;re going to slow it down , and we &apos;re going to go all the way down to zero percent , and we &apos;re going to stop it , and we &apos;re going to get it down .
there are four factors , four factors , five parts per million add to CO2 , and on the right @-@ hand side of the equation , we &apos;re going to turn it down to zero carbon dioxide per capita , and we &apos;re going to be able to use CO2 per unit , and we &apos;re going to end up using CO2 per unit of energy per capita , and we &apos;re going to use CO2 .
obviously , we need at least one factor , which is very high school algebra .
obviously , we need at least one factor of three , and this is a very simple high school algebra , and let &apos;s see , first of all , population counts .
let &apos;s see , first of all , population .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and that will continue to grow to about nine billion people .
there are currently 6.8 billion people in the world , and that will continue to grow to about nine billion people .
if we &apos;re working in new vaccines , new health services , reproductive health , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re working in new vaccines , new health care , reproductive health , that can reduce that number by about 10 to 15 percent , and that &apos;s about 10 percent .
the second element is what we use .
this includes everything : the food we eat , the clothes , the heat , the heat , the heat , the heat , the things that came from this : everything we eat , our clothes , our clothes , our heat , our heat , our movies , they &apos;re beautiful .
and that includes all the things : the food we eat , the clothes , the heat , the heat , the heat , the heat , the things that get out of the world , and that means that it &apos;s a good thing to get away from everybody , and that &apos;s a good thing to get out of the poverty .
getting out of poverty means providing it to everyone on the planet , and that &apos;s a good thing .
in the developed world , the richest one billion people , may be able to control , reduce services , enjoy a large number of people in the developed world , not only could control , reduce cost , but in general , this number will be doubling every year , and yet it will be more than twice as many people will enjoy , but it will be updated every year .
in this area , we have services that are very basic : do you have any lighting in your house ? in this area , we have services that are very basic : do you have any lighting at home ?
the kids don &apos;t , so they go out and sit underneath the street lamp , and the kids don &apos;t do it , so they go out and write down underneath the street lamp .
the next factor is efficiency , the energy consumption of every service , and here we have some good news : it won &apos;t go up .
and we ended up having some good news in this one : it &apos;s not going to go up .
with all sorts of innovations and new ways of lighting , through new technologies , new buildings , new ways of lighting and new ways of lighting , through all sorts of innovations , through new technologies , new ways of buildings , we can reduce the amount of energy we consume , even 90 percent of our energy .
we can reduce the amount of energy consumed by a lot of services , individual services , even 90 percent .
but other services , like fertilizer , fertilizer , <unk> and so on , can go up a lot of space , but other services , like fertilizer , <unk> and so on , can go up a lot of space , but other services , like fertilizer , fertilizer and produce a lot of space .
so , combined , the estimate of the optimism of this is this : we may be able to achieve three to six times smaller , and so , combined , the optimism of this is this : we may be able to achieve three @-@ quarters .
and as we &apos;ve talked about three factors , we &apos;ve narrowed the emissions from 130 tons to 130 gigatons , and we &apos;re not even talking about three factors as long as we &apos;ve been talking about three tons , which is down to 1.3 tons , which is not enough .
in the end , we look at the fourth factor , the fourth factor , the fourth factor , the fourth factor , and one of the most important , is the CO2 per unit .
so the question is , can we really lower to zero ?
he could not . he could not .
he could not . he could not .
all of the electricity we have today produces CO2 , except for the development of renewables and nuclear , all of the electricity we have today , except for the sustainability of renewables .
so we need to create a new system around the world , and we need energy miracles , so we need to create a new system around the world , and we need energy miracles .
so we need to create a new system around the world , and we need energy miracles .
and I used that term for wonder , but it wasn &apos;t impossible .
it &apos;s a miracle , the PC is magic , and the Internet and the applications are magic .
it &apos;s a miracle , the PC is magic , and the Internet and the applications are magic .
in other words , you &apos;ve seen a lot of miracles happening here .
typically , we don &apos;t have a final deadline for wonder , so we don &apos;t have a final set of events .
normally , you just don &apos;t do anything , and there &apos;s some magic that happens .
but in the low @-@ carbon reductions , we have to go all the way , and we have to do that , and we &apos;re going to have to do that in the end , but we &apos;re going to have to do it all the way .
and I thought , &quot; How can I get better at this ? &quot;
and I thought , &quot; How can I get better at this problem ? is there a natural expression ? is there some kind of demonstration that inspires people &apos;s imagination ? &quot;
and I came back about a year ago , and I brought some of these mosquitos here , and it seemed like a little bit more comfortable than I thought about a year ago , and I brought some mosquitos over here , and people were kind of like it .
and the mosquito has really realized that there are some people in the world that live with the mosquito that actually recognizes that there are some people living in the world that live with the mosquito .
so today , since I &apos;m talking about energy , I think this comes with fireflies .
I decided to release fireflies would be my contribution to the environment this year , and I decided that fireflies would be my contribution to the environment that I have here .
there &apos;s a few natural fireflies that say they &apos;re not biting each other , and maybe they &apos;re all alone .
there &apos;s a few natural fireflies that say they &apos;re not biting each other , and maybe they &apos;re all alone .
there &apos;s a few natural fireflies that say they &apos;re not biting each other , and maybe they &apos;re just going to come up with a lot of innovative things like fireflies , but they &apos;re actually quite limited to solving energy problems like fireflies , but they &apos;re actually quite limited .
what we need is a solution , a or a lot of <unk> and reliability solution , what we need is a solution , a solution , or a lot of <unk> , or whatever , we need to be a solution , a or a lot of <unk> solutions , and despite the fact that people are looking at right now , I think there are only five possible solutions .
I didn &apos;t include the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> and the biofuels , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
I didn &apos;t include the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the fuel , but the key thing is that we have to contribute to it , and if they show it more than I expected , of course , because they don &apos;t seem to be challenged , because they don &apos;t seem to be challenged .
let &apos;s take a look at fossil fuels , fossil fuels , or <unk> , first of all , and look at the fossil fuels , <unk> , or <unk> .
and what we need to do , in a nutshell , this is not just what you need to do , is to take all the CO2 from the burning , through the chimneys , and we need to be able to get rid of all the burning of carbon dioxide , through the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to make sure that it doesn &apos;t take off .
the current trials have been done for 60 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult one to do 100 percent test , and the current trials have been done at 60 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be a very difficult problem and where you store a lot of CO2 , and that &apos;s a long @-@ term problem .
who would make sure that ?
one billion times as much waste as any other waste , who can make sure that a long @-@ term safety waste is worth a billion times as much as any waste waste , who can make sure ?
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 , so it &apos;s very difficult .
it &apos;s a very large amount of CO2 , so it &apos;s very difficult .
next , nuclear energy , again , three big questions .
next , nuclear energy , which has three big problems , and it costs , particularly in highly controlled states , very safe , to make sure everything is safe , even if it &apos;s not used as weapons .
what about nuclear waste ?
there &apos;s a lot of concerns about it .
good solutions have to be secure .
it &apos;s three challenges , but it can be solved , so it needs to continue .
the last three energy sources , I &apos;ll put them together .
these are the three sources that people call renewable energy .
in fact , they don &apos;t need fuel , but they do .
the first is that the density of energy that these technologies collect , the density of the plants , is far lower than the energy density of the plants .
this is energy agriculture , and it &apos;s grown up to the size of a square @-@ kilometer .
and also , these energy are dual @-@ edged .
the sun is not all day long , and it &apos;s not always the wind . it &apos;s not always the wind .
if you &apos;re dependent on this source , you have other channels of energy , and you have to have other channels for energy , you have to have other channels for energy .
so , we have a huge cost problem , and we have a challenge for transmission , for example , where energy comes from , not only are you going to need to be able to respond to energy insecurity in the domestic .
and finally , the issue of storage .
in order to make this happen , I looked at all of the current battery , and in order to make this happen , I looked at all the battery @-@ powered battery @-@ powered , computer @-@ generated , <unk> , all the battery @-@ powered , battery @-@ powered , and what I found was that we didn &apos;t have 10 minutes of the energy in the world .
so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough to take a hundred times better solution than the current technology .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
in this way , we can use 20 percent of the energy we need for 30 percent .
but if you want 100 percent efficiency , you need a very efficient miracle battery .
so what do we do ? where do we go ?
is this a Manhattan Project ? how do we get there ?
we need a lot of companies to work together , to get together .
every one of these five approaches , we all need at least 100 people .
a lot of people , and you think they &apos;re crazy , and that &apos;s right .
and I think there are a lot of people in the TED community who are beginning to do this .
Bill <unk> has a <unk> company , and one of them is called <unk> , and it has a really cool , solar @-@ <unk> technology , Bill <unk> , and one of them is <unk> , and it has a really cool <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> investing in the company , whose job is really cool , and it &apos;s interesting , and I plan to support their projects .
and it &apos;s a little bit surprising to me that <unk> and I have supported a company that might be surprised by , but this company is nuclear energy .
in nuclear energy , there &apos;s a little bit of innovation , things like <unk> , liquid water , etc .
but the innovation in the industry has stopped for a while , so there &apos;s some good ideas that aren &apos;t weird .
and the idea was that , instead of burning uranium , low @-@ fat <unk> , the idea of not burning uranium , <unk> , you &apos;re looking for 99 percent of the stuff .
this is a kind of crazy idea , but actually , people have been talking about it for a long time .
it &apos;s a little bit of a crazy idea , but actually , people have been talking about a long time , but there &apos;s no way to mimic whether this is going to evolve , and we can do this now , and it can predict , and it can be possible to use materials .
and because of the fact that we &apos;re burning , 99 percent of the waste that used to be thrown away is enormous .
you actually take waste , and you don &apos;t have to worry about the waste from existing nuclear reactors , which is a good news .
we don &apos;t have to worry about the waste from all nuclear reactors , which is a pretty good news .
and this technology is like a candle , and it &apos;s increasing uranium .
and the process is like this column , which is normally called a <unk> reactor .
the fuel problem is solved .
this is a waste field in Kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , and that &apos;s 99 percent of all the fuel that &apos;s already run out of gas .
these things can power up all over the United States for hundreds of years .
and in addition , just through the very low @-@ cost filter process , you get enough gas to actually use the Earth .
you see , there &apos;s a lot of challenges in front , but this is just one example of one of the ways in which we can continue .
think about how we measure our achievement .
how much should we line up ?
let &apos;s start with what we want , and let &apos;s look at what we want to do in the middle , and look at what we want to do , and then look at what we want .
there &apos;s been a lot of people talking about 80 percent of what we &apos;ve been talking about by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we have to get there .
and the 20 percent of the population of the poorest countries , like some agricultural countries , and hopefully we &apos;ve cleaned up the <unk> and the concrete industry .
so , in order to reach 80 percent of the developed world , and in China , these countries need to change how they generate power .
and the next step is , do we deploy the technologies that we &apos;ve deployed in all of the developed world , and we &apos;ve used techniques to spread elsewhere in the world ?
that &apos;s important .
this is the key ingredient to hand .
what should we do in 2020 ?
well , there are two pieces .
and we should look at the ways that we evaluate efficiency in order to minimize the amount of carbon emissions , and the less CO2 it is .
but in a way , one of the things that we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve done some work in 2020 , but it &apos;s not just the equivalent of a huge amount of carbon emissions , or low carbon tax rate , and that &apos;s the key innovation that comes from innovation .
we need to be able to get all of these technological advances , and we can use the number of companies that we &apos;re involved in , the trial , or the change of policy .
there &apos;s a lot of great books about this topic .
for example , Al Gore &apos;s &quot; Our Choice &quot; in &quot; David <unk> , &quot; &quot; &quot; the heat of power . &quot;
they looked at it , and they built a framework that was easy to talk about , because we had to deal with the problem .
there &apos;s a lot of collaboration .
this is a wish .
we invented this technology as a very specific wish .
if I could give you a wish for the next 50 years , I could choose who would come and choose a vaccine , or a vaccine that I love , or that would create a bridge in half , and I would certainly choose energy .
that would be one of the biggest influences .
if we can &apos;t fulfill this wish of a short @-@ term goal and a long @-@ term goal , there &apos;s a huge divide between Americans and China , and the poorest countries , and the rich countries , and the two billion poorest , most of them are dramatically degraded .
so what do we have to do ?
what do I ask you to engage in ?
we should be raising research .
in places like Copenhagen , where countries shouldn &apos;t talk about cutting carbon emissions .
we should also talk about the creative schedule , and the kinds of creative constraints that you can put into these kinds of ideas , are absolutely shocked .
we really need some market inspired , carbon dioxide , <unk> and trading , for these things .
we need to get information out .
we should make it more conceptual , more accessible , including the government .
this is an important wish , and I think this is a wish for it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you , and I knew a little bit more about this , and one of the first things you could say is , how big is this investment ?
Bill Gates : if we just buy a supercomputer , and we hire good scientists , we &apos;ve done it in about <unk> , and we even went to a Russian reactor testing our material to see if it could work , but it costs a few billion dollars .
and the hard part is to build these reactors for billions of dollars , run them around , find them , pick them up , and then build these first nuclear power stations .
and when you build the first one , if it does , it &apos;s as simple as it is , because its economy , its energy density , is completely different than the nuclear energy we know .
so , does this really need to go underneath and build a <unk> square @-@ kilometer @-@ long column using this sort of abandoned <unk> @-@ like <unk> @-@ like <unk> , and then the reaction goes from underneath ?
right . now , nuclear reactors , you &apos;ve got to <unk> fuel all the time , so there &apos;s a lot of <unk> and control , and you &apos;ve got to open the reactor and you &apos;ve got to get out of it , and it &apos;s going to go wrong , and you &apos;ve got to get rid of it , and it &apos;s going to get a little bit wrong .
so , if there &apos;s a very cheap fuel , a two @-@ legged ratio , for 60 years , so if there &apos;s a very cheap fuel , a two @-@ liter fuel size , put it down in 60 years , there &apos;s no complex consequences .
put it there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s gone .
that &apos;s the kind of nuclear power plant in its own processing .
right . the waste from this process is generated , and you can put it there , and you can just take a few waste out of it , and you can put it in another nuclear power plant , and you can burn it in a different nuclear power plant .
and we can begin to process the waste from existing nuclear power plants that are currently sitting next to the <unk> or the reactor that we started with .
so the current reactor is in its own trouble , but it &apos;s also our ingredients , and it &apos;s reducing our waste so that the current waste is in trouble , and that the waste is our material , and it &apos;s reducing our waste , and at the same time , it &apos;s our material , it &apos;s degraded .
Moderator : when you and other people around you talk about the possibilities .
who was interested in doing that ?
J We hadn &apos;t chosen a specific place , because there were secrecy everywhere , and many people said they were interested in Russia , India , and the Chinese companies were engaging in this situation , and I was also fascinated by how to integrate that into the energy agenda .
I &apos;m optimistic , and also France and Japan have done some work .
this is a variant of what has been done .
this is an important improvement , but like a quick <unk> reactor , a lot of countries have built these reactors , as long as you &apos;ve already got a fast reactor , you might be the first nuclear waste ever to use .
as you can see , what time and possibilities for this project ?
Bill Gates : build a massive power plant , and we &apos;re going to have to have a very low @-@ cost power plant , and we &apos;re going to have to be very low in 20 years to invent .
and that &apos;s about the end @-@ of @-@ the @-@ end version of our environmental model , and this is basically the end of our environmental model .
and if everything goes fine , then of course it &apos;s not going to be easy to meet , and it &apos;s going to be very easy to meet if it doesn &apos;t work , and it &apos;s going to be very easy to meet .
there are still four companies that are doing this , and we need to be able to figure out what happens if they &apos;re going to be science , and if they &apos;re going to do the research , then they &apos;re going to be able to compete .
and if it &apos;s successful , then it &apos;s best because it can be used in multiple ways .
but we need at least a success .
if there &apos;s a big innovation , it &apos;s the biggest innovation you know .
climate change is the most important thing .
even if there &apos;s no environmental limitations , it &apos;s going to be the most important question in the world , and it becomes more urgent .
in nuclear , there are other inventors .
but I didn &apos;t know what they were doing , and we didn &apos;t know that some people were innovation in the module , and that was another way .
there &apos;s a liquid reactor that &apos;s kind of difficult , but maybe they look at the way we do .
so , there &apos;s a lot of different ways , but the beautiful thing about nuclear energy is that there &apos;s a lot of different energy in it , like a million times , but the beauty of nuclear is that there &apos;s a certain amount of energy in it , like a million times the energy , if it &apos;s enough , it &apos;s a negative , radiation , and it &apos;s enough .
Moderator : what if we haven &apos;t succeeded ?
what kind of heat do we have to take to make sure that the Earth &apos;s temperature is stable ?
Gates : what if things were growing like eating too much , could you have a heart attack ? you might need a heart attack .
there &apos;s a study called Earth <unk> that can fight us for 20 or 30 years with various technologies .
but that &apos;s like a insurance policy .
you don &apos;t want to use it .
some people say there &apos;s no need to study insurance , because it &apos;s going to keep you from eating , but you know that the heart can save you .
and if you think about the importance of the problem , I don &apos;t know if this is so wise to talk about the earth as a backup plan , in case it &apos;s going to get worse , or maybe later on in advance .
Moderator : how do you convince them of climate change , if you convince them of climate change ?
sadly , I &apos;m from different camps .
very few of them have scientific evidence .
they say that the outcomes of the cloud are caused by the cloud , and they say the result of the cloud is caused by the cloud .
they have very few compelling evidence that even one in a million chance .
the main question here is like HIV .
now , to make a mistake , you have to double your suffering .
so when you have an urge to take care of what &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s a <unk> pain in the future , and the IPCC report , it &apos;s not the worst case , and somebody in the developed world looked at it and said it &apos;s not a big deal .
in fact , uncertainty should lead us to this .
but my wish is , if you add energy to the economy , and you <unk> CO2 , but my wish is , if you make energy affordable , and then you <unk> that with CO2 emissions , you say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care about carbon dioxide . &quot;
but I &apos;m going to take this new approach , because energy is cheaper than ever , and that is to say , &quot; This is the response to you versus the <unk> , &quot; which means , if you spend all your energy trying to solve CO2 problems , then you &apos;re going to replace all of the other things that are more important to solve CO2 .
J R &amp; amp ; D is not that much , although the United States should spend more than 100 dollars a year on this , it should not affect what other things are saying : actually , the R &amp; amp ; D R &amp; amp ; D is not going to affect how much of the United States is going to affect .
J The actual R &amp; amp ; D is not that much , until the United States should be spending more than 100 bucks on this , and that should not affect anything else .
for a career , if it &apos;s not affordable , for me , it &apos;s basically a waste , and some people disagree about what it is , if it &apos;s not affordable , it &apos;s basically a waste of money for me , and some people might disagree about what it is , if I don &apos;t think it &apos;s economic , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s possible .
unless you &apos;re very close to success , and you &apos;re investing in the portfolio , and it &apos;s going to be very cheap , unless you &apos;re close to success , and you &apos;re investing in the portfolio , and it &apos;s going to become very cheap , otherwise I think we should try to figure out a way to have a low @-@ cost solution .
if you &apos;re going to solve the climate problem , it &apos;s going to make energy more expensive , it &apos;s going to be expensive , it &apos;s going to be rich , it &apos;s going to be expensive , it &apos;s going to be expensive , it &apos;s going to be expensive .
for those of you who sit in the room , it &apos;s not going to affect the way we live , and it &apos;s not going to affect the way we live .
but for the two billion people on Earth , the poor are a disaster .
and the idea of <unk> has changed , and the argument is now , why don &apos;t we get more attention ?
and the idea of <unk> has changed , and the argument is now , why don &apos;t we get more attention ?
for historical reasons , he was still in the camp , but he had realized that it was a rather lonely camp , and he was a very lonely camp , and he was a very lonely camp , but he realized that it was a rather lonely camp for a rather lonely camp .
and I think that &apos;s a very controversial subject , because there &apos;s so few things to do with science .
and I think that &apos;s a very controversial subject , because there &apos;s so few things to do with science .
Bill , I think most people here are like me , really hope your dream , thank you .
thank you .
a few years ago , at TED , Peter <unk> introduced a design challenge called cotton <unk> .
it &apos;s a very simple idea : a group of four people who want to build an independent building , a 20 @-@ cent piece of <unk> in Italy , a piece of cotton .
the cotton has to put it on the top .
and it &apos;s not easy , because it requires people to come together quickly .
and I thought this was an interesting idea , and I put it in a design meeting .
and the results were pretty successful .
since then , I &apos;ve been working on more than 70 different design activities around the world , getting students and designers , and architects and even wealth , and this practice has given us a profound lesson in many ways to teach us about how to collaborate , where I share some of these with you .
usually , people always start talking about this task .
they were talking about what would happen , and what they said they were right or wrong .
and then they spent a little bit of time planning , and they took a look at the drawing , and they took the spaghetti sauce .
they used a lot of time to get their spaghetti sauce back together .
and then finally , the time was finished , and they took the cotton candy and put it on top of it , and then they went back , and they looked at it .
but most of the time , what really happened was that the <unk> @-@ ha got really bad , because the weight of the cotton candy put the whole structure into the structure .
and then some of them got worse and worse than others , and the least of them are the new business schools .
they were lying , they were lying , they were <unk> , they were very tough .
and of course there are teams , and they &apos;ve created more <unk> , and the best one , which is the new kindergarten class .
it &apos;s a really magical thing .
as Laura Lee told us , not only did they make the highest building , but they also built the most interesting structure .
so what do you ask ? what do they have ?
and Peter likes to say this , because there are no children trying to make the CEO of an Italian company , <unk> is the <unk> .
they &apos;re not spending any time on power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
because a business school student has trained to find a right thing .
and then they follow the plan .
but the truth is , when they put the cotton at the top , they took a finite amount of time , and what happened ?
the crisis came .
sound familiar ? yes .
and the way kids do it is different , they start with the cotton candy , and they take a model , and then they keep in the prototypes , and they always keep the sugar at the top , and so they have a lot of opportunities to do this model .
and so the designer recognized that this partnership is a matter of interaction .
for every version , the child will quickly get feedback and they know what &apos;s right and nothing .
so the ability to grasp the prototype is really key , and let &apos;s see how different teams behave .
the average height of most of the <unk> tower is 20 feet high , and the average school student , probably half a dozen lawyers , but not anywhere in kindergarten , it &apos;s better than most adults .
who does it best ?
architects and engineers , thank God .
the tallest tower I &apos;ve ever met is 39 inches .
why ? because they understand that triangles and their patterns of self @-@ preservation are the key to the structure of architectural stability .
the president is a little bit better than average , but the interesting thing is that it &apos;s interesting .
if you add one of their teams , they get a lot better .
it &apos;s just incredible . you look around , and you say , &quot; <unk> won . &quot;
you know , why ?
because they have specific simplicity .
they run the processes . they learn the processes .
in short , any group has a positive governance and focused on the work itself , there &apos;s a dramatic increase in performance .
the combination of expertise and the ability to use simple techniques is to combine them .
if you have 10 million people in this activity , there are about six of them that can build structures that can stand upright .
and I made an interesting try .
and I thought , let &apos;s take that one .
so I gave birth to a $ 100,000 software for a few groups of people .
and guess what happens when the students who design it ?
what happens ?
and this is the result , not one group , has completed a standing building .
even if any small group has done an inch of a building , they can put a <unk> back in .
so , what &apos;s interesting is that there &apos;s a big role in the prize .
and then we repeated this in the same students .
guess what ?
and here they know the value of the <unk> model .
so the worst group became the best team .
they took the lowest time building .
and this is a very deep education in all of us that explains the essence of rewards and success .
so , you might ask yourself , &quot; How do you ever spend some time writing a cotton problem ? &quot;
and the reason for that is that I can use a process of <unk> and processes to help people build cars , video games and visualization .
and the cotton challenge us to recognize the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has their own cotton candy .
the challenge here is the universal access to a common language .
it &apos;s this simple exercise that gives us valuable experience .
if you &apos;re interested , you can go to <unk>
this is a blog you can read , and it tells you how to build cotton .
there &apos;s a specific set of instructions .
and there &apos;s weird examples from all over the world that people can adjust the system .
there &apos;s a world record there .
and I believe that the fundamental source of design is actually a form of communication .
it asked us to take all of our public goods and put them in our task asking us to use the best of thinking , our sense of actions , and to welcome our challenge .
and at some point , an experience of a small model will help us turn it into a moment where the moment of the game is <unk> .
and the result is huge .
thank you .
let &apos;s envision a machine here .
it &apos;s a big , cool , TED machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
everybody &apos;s going to walk into this time .
you can choose to go back to the past or to the future , which is that you can &apos;t stop .
and I &apos;m thinking about what you &apos;re going to do , and I &apos;ve asked my friends a couple of times more about this , and they &apos;re all backwards .
I don &apos;t understand . they say , back to the age of no cars or Twitter or American icon .
I don &apos;t really understand .
I &apos;m sure there must be some <unk> or some <unk> .
and I can understand that .
but I have to admit , I &apos;m not in a mess with them .
I don &apos;t want to go back to the past , not because I like adventure .
it &apos;s because the probability of the Earth , not to go to the past , you have to go to the future .
in other words , I wanted to walk into this machine and go to the future .
our age is the best time , whether you look at it in any way , like health , mobility , opportunities , rates go down .
never before .
my grandparents died at the age of 60 .
my grandparents died in their 70s .
my parents died when they died .
I wish I was dying by a nine @-@ digit number .
but it &apos;s not just about us , because it &apos;s more than us .
one of the children born in Delhi today can be the most brilliant people in the world today .
think about it . this is a remarkable fact .
why does this happen ?
because we killed smallpox . smallpox killed hundreds of millions of people on the planet .
it <unk> the Earth &apos;s population , and it &apos;s virtually impossible to see any war .
but it &apos;s been wiped out today .
it was something that was invented by mankind .
in today &apos;s richest society , just one generation ago , there &apos;s almost no threat anymore .
<unk> , Germany , measles , almost no polio .
do you know what those names mean ?
vaccines and modern medicine and the ability to provide millions of people with food , both of which are the triumph of science .
it seems to me that the scientific method is an ongoing trial , trial , change , and it &apos;s one of the greatest <unk> of humankind .
so these are the good news .
but unfortunately , the good news is so much , because we &apos;ve had a lot of other problems , and we &apos;ve talked a lot about it .
one of them is , although we &apos;ve achieved a tremendous amount of progress , there &apos;s a billion people in the world that live in hunger , every day they suffer from hunger .
the numbers are speeding up , and it &apos;s going up fast , and that &apos;s allowing us to take it off .
not only that , but the imagination of the human imagination and the tremendous garbage .
drinking water , tropical rainforests , oil , gas , all of these resources disappearing and disappearing fast unless we understand innovation , we don &apos;t have any hope .
the question is , can we do it ? I think we can do it .
I think we can produce enough food for billions of people , and not damage the land that they depend on .
and I think we can find some energy sources that feed the world .
and I do believe that that &apos;s true , it &apos;s not true .
but I always found something that kept me awake at night , and this is one of the things that blew my mind at night . there &apos;s never been advances in human history like this .
and in history , we never had the opportunity to use these technologies like this today .
in many areas , we were all standing in the midst of an incredible discovery , and in fact , I think we need to look back , and back 300 years ago , only in the Renaissance , there were people who were going to be more violent than we are today .
people always like to put themselves in their own framework , and they kill themselves so often that they don &apos;t die .
they can &apos;t shake them .
listen , everybody can maintain his point , and they can even insist on the idea of progress .
but do you know what you can &apos;t stick ?
you can &apos;t just stick with what you know . really , you can &apos;t .
and it took me a while to learn .
about 10 years ago , I wrote a story to The New Yorker about small vaccines .
but what I discovered was that there was a sort of <unk> against me that they were against the most effective public health measures in human history .
I really didn &apos;t know what to do , and I just did what I should do . and the story was done , and I did something else .
shortly afterwards , I wrote an article on genetically engineered food .
and it got a lot of opposition , and it got bigger than once .
people were crazy .
and so I wrote an article on that , and I couldn &apos;t really understand why people would understand this as food for evil spirits , and I didn &apos;t understand why people would think that , in a certain way , rather than simply , that living molecules are natural .
but I did what I needed to do , and the story came out , and I didn &apos;t care about it .
I &apos;m a journalist .
our job is to write , publish , eat , and that &apos;s our life .
but it was uncomfortable for me , and I didn &apos;t know what reason was , until then I knew .
these crazy <unk> molecules that made me mad , are not <unk> molecules .
they are people with ideas , people with great education , integrity , and citizenship .
they &apos;re like people in this room .
it really bothers me .
and I thought , let &apos;s face it .
our age is different from where we are today .
we &apos;re looking at progress in a very confused way .
we &apos;re going to talk about progress in the context of the ironic mystery : the pace of progress .
and I think there &apos;s a reason for that , and we know why .
our institutions for civil society , for government , sometimes even for science , have lost trust , and maybe we have reason for not trust .
just a couple of names , and you know what happened .
Chernobyl , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and anti @-@ <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , and half of those votes .
I think you can put a list in your mind .
we &apos;ve had a complete faith in the past , and it &apos;s been a problem now , so people should have a little skeptical .
ask a couple of questions , ask for evidence and evidence .
you can &apos;t believe anything .
but one thing to notice is that when you get the evidence , you need to take that kind of evidence , but we don &apos;t do that .
and the reason for that , I think , is that we all now have this fear of an epidemic of infectious disease , and the depth of the disease that I never experienced , and I don &apos;t want to go further .
12 years ago , the media had written a message , which was a very horrible news , and it combined with measles and <unk> and vaccines .
it &apos;s really scary .
so there &apos;s a lot of research around that .
there &apos;s a need to do this , because it &apos;s a serious event .
and the data came out .
from the United States , Sweden , Sweden , Canada &apos;s data has shown the same thing : autism and vaccines that don &apos;t have any contact , there &apos;s no communication , there &apos;s no communication .
but that turns out there &apos;s not a lot of sense for the public , because we like to listen to small stories , we believe that the eyes we see , believe in what we believe , believe in what we believe , what we believe in .
but it &apos;s not believed that a stack of documents that didn &apos;t believe in government data , and I could understand this , and I think all of us have this .
but what happens ?
the consequences are unbelievable .
listen to this fact : the United States is the only country in the world where measles was falling .
it &apos;s enough for us to be ashamed , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s a terrible thing .
what caused this happen ?
now I understand . I really understand .
have any of you ever had measles benefits ?
have any of you ever seen someone dying of measles ?
no , no more .
in fact , it doesn &apos;t happen in this country , but in the last year , 16 million people have died due to measles .
this number is huge , and basically 20 people die every hour .
but because it wasn &apos;t happening all around us , we could keep up with people like Mo <unk> that could still be transmitted to their fears and ignorance .
and the reason they did this is because they didn &apos;t put the reason together .
and they didn &apos;t know that the things that looked like were actually the same .
we need lessons from all of that , and we need to learn better .
this guy , <unk> <unk> , is a hero .
because he invented the polio vaccine for people to avoid the worst disaster .
now people don &apos;t need to fear this disease , they don &apos;t have the pain , they disappear .
the guy in the middle wasn &apos;t so upset .
he called Paul <unk> .
he and a couple of other researchers have developed a vaccine .
this vaccine can save four billion children a year in the developing world .
should be good , right ?
and it &apos;s really great . this is a place where Paul talks to people about this vaccine , and they say , &quot; How good they are , &quot; they can come from .
he did .
so , we looked at Paul as the terrorists .
and when Paul <unk> the Senate , he must have armed guards .
he gets a call at home because people tell him where he knows where his child is .
why ? because Paul invented a vaccine .
I didn &apos;t have to talk about this , but vaccines are really important .
once the vaccine stops , the disease will come back , and it &apos;s a terrible disease , and this is happening .
now the United States has come along with measles .
and it gets worse and worse , and soon there &apos;s children dying of this disease , which is just a matter of numbers .
not just measles .
with polio , who says it doesn &apos;t happen again ?
a friend of mine wrote a letter to me a couple of weeks ago , and she said I &apos;m a little too nerdy .
no one ever said that before .
she said she wasn &apos;t going to vaccinate children . she certainly wouldn &apos;t .
all right .
why ? because there &apos;s no polio in this country , but you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have this disease yesterday .
today , I don &apos;t know , perhaps one of the <unk> planes from Lagos , and his destination was Los Angeles airport .
a few hours later , he &apos;s going to the ground , and he &apos;s going to come up to Long Beach , and he &apos;s going to be here at a TED dinner .
he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with polio , and we don &apos;t know , that &apos;s the truth of the world .
the truth of our planet is , don &apos;t think it &apos;s true .
we like to believe lies . we all love to do that .
have each of you eaten vitamin per morning ?
or maybe a little bit of <unk> , or maybe a little bit of <unk> , just eat it .
and the reason you do that is because half of Americans do this every day .
they eat this , and they eat it , and even though we already know that these things don &apos;t work .
that &apos;s what the data says .
it &apos;s not going to be able to eat the urine at all .
and if you &apos;re willing to spend 280 billion dollars trying to get some black sides of it .
I &apos;m not averse .
it &apos;s black urine , it &apos;s black .
why do we do that ? why ?
I think I can understand . we have a huge problem in this country .
and we hate big government , because we don &apos;t trust people in that .
but we don &apos;t have to do that . our healthcare system is so bad .
it &apos;s a cruel system for millions of people .
and for those who can afford it , it &apos;s also a form of <unk> and ruthless medical system .
so we wanted to escape from that . where do we go ?
we put in a huge embrace of placebo .
and this is a wonderful one , and I love placebo .
but you know , it &apos;s a serious thing because it &apos;s a big thing , but we have a trillion dollars to buy placebo .
I have all kinds of samples here .
none of them work , whether it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . I don &apos;t know what it is , but we spend billions of dollars buying them , and that &apos;s deception .
but you know what ? when I say here , people scream at me . they say , &quot; Well , you know , when you &apos;re screaming . let &apos;s get people to do it . &quot;
eat placebo , at least it makes people feel miserable . &quot;
you know ? you &apos;re wrong .
I &apos;m not going to be healthy . if the American Health minister of health and the public minister said , &quot; But it doesn &apos;t matter if the experts find the evidence of the breast X line , &quot; or a cancer <unk> wants to cure his patients by coffee .
if you believe that belief and magic is not evidence and science , you end up going to a place where you don &apos;t want to go .
maybe you will end up being the leader of South Africa .
he insisted that <unk> and <unk> were better at treating AIDS than we knew about AIDS .
thousands of people who didn &apos;t want to die were killed , and that &apos;s where the most severe HIV @-@ infected .
please don &apos;t tell me that these types of examples don &apos;t happen .
and the consequences are always there .
now , the most ignorance epidemic that we &apos;ve encountered is the result of genetically engineered crops and <unk> between two camps .
that &apos;s a stupid argument . we have to stop that argument .
because arguments are just words and metaphor .
it &apos;s about ideology , not about science .
every single thing that we have in our stomach , every <unk> , every <unk> , every single <unk> , is changed by himself .
there were no orange in the Eden .
there &apos;s no <unk> .
there &apos;s no Christmas tree . it &apos;s all made @-@ up .
humans have made these things in the last 11 years .
some trials succeeded , some of them failed .
the ones that failed attempt were falling apart .
and now we can do this in a much more precise way , and this is certainly risky , but we can put vitamin A.
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
I just said , I don &apos;t understand that .
a lot of us are against genetically modified foods .
why ?
and the reason I hear a lot about this is that there &apos;s so much chemistry , too much pesticides , too , hormones , hormones , testosterone , that we don &apos;t really want to be producing the same crop as well .
we don &apos;t want businesses to be able to license new crops .
we also didn &apos;t want to let the companies <unk> .
can you guess what I respond to these objections ?
yeah , guess right , let &apos;s solve these problems .
OK , we had a very serious food problem , but it &apos;s not a science issue .
because it &apos;s not science .
this is the issue of law , ethics , patent law .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
not even an idea , it &apos;s a process .
and it &apos;s sometimes successful , sometimes failure , but because we &apos;re afraid that we shouldn &apos;t let scientists go and learn how to do it is terrifying , and that will prevent millions of people from getting to prosperity .
in the next 50 years , we need more than 70 percent of the food that we have today .
this is the total investment we &apos;ve spent 30 years investing in Africa .
it &apos;s very embarrassing .
people would need this , but we don &apos;t .
why ? because of genetically engineered food .
we didn &apos;t encourage people to eat the wrong food , like the tables of the tables .
there are 5,000 people in the world who eat <unk> .
that &apos;s a comparison of a grain of grass .
it &apos;s just calories , it &apos;s not good .
there &apos;s no nutrition , there &apos;s no protein , there &apos;s a scientist trying to put that in the form of cassava .
and when you eat that , you can avoid being blind .
you don &apos;t starve . you know .
that &apos;s good . it &apos;s not as good as restaurants , but it &apos;s also good .
and I just said , &quot; Why are some people against this ? &quot;
ask yourself , why are we against this ?
do we want to move the genome ?
this is just moving some genomes , nothing related to adding chemicals .
we always want to get more food , better food , more food .
it &apos;s not a meter @-@ wide construction , but it &apos;s just trying to get some of the live lives , and it &apos;s time for us to really understand what this process means .
you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , we stick with it now , and we &apos;re going to do it because we don &apos;t want it to happen , and it &apos;s going to be a high @-@ tech <unk> .
no other word is more appropriate to describe it .
this is selfish , <unk> , doing this just to reduce our dignity , we have to stop doing that .
all right , and after a very interesting conversation , you might say , you know , you &apos;re going to walk into this machine , and you &apos;re going to go towards the future ?
of course . I will .
it &apos;s a machine right now , but we have a great opportunity .
we can build any time machine .
we can go there . we can go there .
we need to start having conversations like this , and we need to think , when we enter the time of time and the future , we will be thrilled with our choices .
and I believe that we can , and that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
all right .
and for a long time , I was interested in <unk> <unk> , and usually a magician isn &apos;t interested in placebo , but if you think about it from my career , that &apos;s making something real , and making it happen .
in other words , what you can see in some of these studies is the result of a placebo placebo , because people think that what happens to them is a drug , or give an example of a drug for a drug called <unk> , and if they believe it &apos;s a drug , there &apos;s a significant effect on them .
fake things become real because people understand it .
to understand each other , I want to start showing you a very simple , simple magic .
and I will tell you how I became , and this is the simple magic that came from every child in the &apos; 50s .
I learned it in the &apos; 70s by the magic child .
I &apos;ll just show you , and then I &apos;ll explain .
and finally , I will explain why .
see , how that became magic .
this knife , you can examine it ; my hand , you can check it .
and I just stuck in my fist .
and then I brush my sleeves up .
at the same time , making sure there &apos;s nothing going to go up and down my sleeve , and I &apos;m bending my wrist .
and then you can see there &apos;s no time for anything , and as long as I can tell you , there &apos;s no such thing as my sleeve .
it &apos;s very simple .
I &apos;m going to open my palm up , and I hope that if everything works , my biological magnet will actually stick this knife .
in fact , it &apos;s so tight that I can even shake the knife and drop it .
there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , no tricks . you can look at it .
all right .
well , this is a magic trick that I often teach kids about magic , because you can learn a lot about deception by learning about this magic -- even though it &apos;s a very simple magic approach .
there &apos;s probably a lot of people here who know this magic .
it happened .
I hold the knife in my hand .
I said I &apos;m going to grab my wrist to make sure there &apos;s no such thing as a lie through my sleeve .
and the reason I hold my wrist is because of the secret of this <unk> .
and as I move your hand over to the top of your hand , this finger , and I &apos;m going to move my finger from here , and I &apos;m going to the point where I &apos;m going .
all right .
there &apos;s a lot of people sitting there .
and that &apos;s how my finger moved , from here , right .
and as I rotate my hand , my finger moves .
we can talk about why this is liar &apos;s , why you don &apos;t realize that only three fingers beneath this , because your consciousness , and the way we process consciousness , it doesn &apos;t calculate one , two , three . it <unk> them .
but that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to talk about today . right ? I &apos;m going to open up my palm .
obviously it &apos;s lined up there , not through any physiological magnet , but through deception , my <unk> .
and I <unk> my finger again , and again , as it does , it sort of <unk> my fingers .
shake the hand . you take the knife .
this trick you can do with your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with a placebo ?
I read a study about a year ago , and it opened my perception .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this is a surprising thing for me .
it shows that if you give a patient a placebo in a white pill , like aspirin , if it &apos;s a circle of white pills , there &apos;s a certain amount of placebo effects .
but if you change the form of a placebo , like if you turn it into a small pill , and paint a letter in blue , it has a much more obvious effect .
there &apos;s no real medicine in both of them -- they &apos;re all <unk> .
but the white pills are the ones with no blue .
what ? it really confused me .
but in fact , that &apos;s not the end .
if you take the capsule , they work more than any form of pills .
there &apos;s a color capsule , a yellow one , and the red one on the other is more effective than the white capsule .
a dose is a dose .
one day two , a piece of paper didn &apos;t work . I &apos;m sorry .
but the point is .
the dose is about medicine .
<unk> form and medicine .
if you want to get a placebo at the right level , you need an injection of <unk> .
right ? one or two <unk> with a syringe , you inject it into a patient .
in their mind , this is a powerful imagination , which should be a lot more than white pills .
it &apos;s a very strong imagination , and when I have the slide , I can show you the statistics .
the point is that white pills don &apos;t have blue pills ; there &apos;s no <unk> .
they don &apos;t really have medicine . it &apos;s just your belief that making it happen to you , and they have a stronger effect .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to magic tricks .
some clearly a fake trick made it look real .
we know from the study that if you want to have a fish , you take an <unk> .
this is a <unk> cap . it &apos;s pretty cool . I &apos;m going to take it down .
this is my muscle . this is not a diamond ring .
this is my skin . this is not Hollywood <unk> .
and I &apos;m going to dive into my skin and pull this needle through the other side .
if you &apos;re a bit nervous -- if you &apos;re easy to remember -- I showed some friends yesterday in the hotel , and there were people I didn &apos;t know , there was a woman who almost died .
so , I would suggest that if you &apos;re easy to remember , you &apos;d better look anywhere in the next 30 seconds , in fact , you know what , I would do a bad part behind it .
you &apos;ll see , you can see elsewhere if you want .
well , that &apos;s what happened , right here , right next to my lower arm , I had a little hole .
excuse me . have I scared you ?
just walk through my skin a little bit like this .
now , we &apos;re basically in the same position as a knife .
pretty much .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers now , right ?
so let me show them . one , two , three , four , five .
yes , oh .
I know what people want when they see this .
and they said , &quot; Well , he &apos;s not going to break through his skin and play us for a few minutes .
so let me peek at you .
what would that look like ? good .
yeah , I know .
and the people in the back said , &quot; OK . I don &apos;t really see that . I don &apos;t really see that . &quot;
the people in the remote room are now capable of filtering .
let me show you this .
this is actually my skin . this is not a Hollywood effect .
that &apos;s my meat , and I can rotate it .
sorry . if you feel disgust , look somewhere , forget this .
the person in the back , or a few years later , looked at this and said , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s a little bit missing , but if it &apos;s a real hole , it &apos;s got a hole , if it &apos;s real bleed .
let me give you some blood .
yes , that &apos;s it .
now , normally I would take the needle out .
I would wash my arms and show you I didn &apos;t have any injury .
but I think that in this case , things that come from this point of view become real , and I &apos;m going to stop here and walk down the stage .
I &apos;ll see you in the next couple of days .
I want you to look forward . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about pleasure recently .
in the last five years , I &apos;ve asked the number of people to come up with a book in recent years , about 40 years , and then about 40 of them .
more and more researchers are starting to get interested in happiness .
and there &apos;s a lot of happy sports mentors .
making other people happy is their goal .
and while these kinds of jobs continue to be a couple of cognitive trap , these traps will increase the complexity of happiness .
I &apos;m going to focus on these cognitive trap .
these traps , they affect the way people think about themselves , and they affect the judgment of the scholars , because we all make a mistake .
the first trap is the complexity of happiness .
as it turns out , pleasure is no longer a regular word , because we have so much to interpret .
and I think we should define what it means , but generally , we have to give up this idea of what it &apos;s like to live in a more complex way .
the second one is the combination of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s about pleasure and pleasure in life and the difference between your life and your life .
and the meaning of that , the distance between the two and the joy of the night .
the third trap is the illusion , <unk> , in any case , when we think about pleasant life , we think it &apos;s important .
I mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
it &apos;s <unk> .
now , I want to start with an example , and there &apos;s a guy named <unk> <unk> <unk> who told me a story about the &#91; unclear &#93; -- &#91; unclear &#93; who said he had a very nice music when he was listening to a symphony , but at the end , the <unk> sound of the <unk> , the <unk> .
and then he was so excited that this was a mouse that had broken down .
but it wasn &apos;t .
and what &apos;s happening here is that it &apos;s only memory of that experience .
he experienced this experience .
he also experienced a 20 @-@ minute hearing winner .
but now it &apos;s a little bit smaller , because the night sky leaves a memory ; it &apos;s that awful memory , and the other 20 @-@ minute prizes are completely forgotten .
and this tells us that we are thinking about ourselves and other people , using two types of self .
the first one is self @-@ experience , and it &apos;s a self that lives at the moment , and it &apos;s kind of a historical perspective , but it &apos;s basically his moment .
now , what happens is the experience of the doctor -- as the doctor asked you , do I touch you when you touch me here ?
another self is a memory , and he &apos;s in charge of his life , and he &apos;s in charge of his life , and he &apos;s looking for him , and he &apos;s going to ask him , &quot; How do they feel recently ? &quot;
or should it be fun to go to Italy , or should it be fun ?
experience self and memory are completely different , and the combination of those two is why we don &apos;t understand pleasure .
our memories are responsible for telling stories .
the story starts with our memories -- immediate upload .
it wasn &apos;t the stories we were telling .
it &apos;s a story of our memories being a storyteller .
let me start with an example .
this is an ancient study .
some of the real patients are going to adopt a painful treatment .
the details go into details . the therapies of today are no longer true , but in the 1990s , it &apos;s a terrible solution .
every six seconds , the patient has to report their pain index .
here are two patients . this is their record .
and I asked you , &quot; Who &apos;s <unk> in them ? &quot;
it &apos;s a simple question .
clearly , the patient is B. He has a thin tree , and the patient &apos;s <unk> has a sense of halfway up , and he &apos;s continued .
but there &apos;s another question : do these patients think they &apos;re suffering ?
here &apos;s a little accident .
and the amazing thing is that the patient &apos;s memory of a <unk> is actually worse than the patient .
the story of the two trees is different , and the bottom line is the story .
both of them don &apos;t inspire wisdom , but they &apos;re obviously different .
one of them obviously felt worse than another .
and it felt worse , and it was not a good story in the very last period .
how do we know that ?
because we asked them at the end of the study , and we asked them once again , what do you think about the <unk> of the <unk> ?
it turns out that A &apos;s memory is obviously worse than B.
now this is a direct conflict between self and memory .
from an experience of self @-@ experience , the patient is obviously a little bit miserable .
so what the patient is explaining , we actually did a clinical trial , and when the experiment is done , we got the results from that , and in fact we could shrink the duration of the patient and then slow down the lines .
the patient still hurts a lot .
and if you continue this way , you &apos;re going to make the patient &apos;s experience worse , but the memory of the patient is much better , because you give the patient a better story , a better memory .
how do you define good stories ?
and the memories tell us the story is real , and the stories we tell are real .
the good news is it takes a few moments to end .
and at the end , it &apos;s a very important story , and the story of that is led by the end .
now , it &apos;s self @-@ organizing .
he had a moment of experience , one after another .
and you say , &quot; How do you take these moments ? come on .
and the answer is simple . they disappear forever .
most of the moments in our lives -- I &apos;ll just take a second -- from a psychology point of view , and that means there &apos;s about <unk> moments in your life , and in a month , there &apos;s about three million moments of silence , and they don &apos;t leave any traces whatsoever .
most of our memories are completely ignored .
and yet , you can also see that some of the feelings are stored , because every moment in our experience , all of them form together .
as long as we live , we consume these limited resources .
how to use them , it seems to be important , but it &apos;s not the story of our own self .
and so memory itself is very , very different .
the biggest difference between them is the process of processing time .
in experience , if you have a holiday , the first week one and the other two weeks of happiness is twice the amount of stolen .
but the memory self is not the same .
for the memory self , two weeks , it &apos;s no more than a week of vacation , because there &apos;s no new kind of thing going on .
and this is still true .
so time is the key ingredient for self @-@ expression and experience , and time is not big for the story .
it &apos;s not just memory and telling stories .
it &apos;s also a matter of making decisions , because , if your patient has gone through two different surgeons who &apos;ve actually decided to look at it from one of their <unk> , the patient &apos;s perception is better than the memory , and that &apos;s how the doctor chooses .
experience itself is self @-@ organizing .
in fact , we don &apos;t actually choose between two different experiences , we make choices in two different experiences .
and when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think in the form of experience .
we &apos;re going to present our future in the form of memories .
and by and large , you can see that memory itself is a tyrant , you can imagine that the memory self is <unk> by dragging himself , by taking the experience of not being .
and I had the idea that , as we were closed , there was a big part of it for our own memories .
and I think that &apos;s a little bit of <unk> .
how much memory do we use ?
and that could explain why memory itself can be the dominant self .
and it reminded me of a vacation I spent a couple of years at the South Pole , which is one of my great <unk> , and I tend to think of this a lot of the time .
and it took me about a three @-@ week period to about 25 minutes to get there .
now , as I opened the door , there &apos;s about 600 photographs in it , and I might take an hour to remember .
three weeks of journey took from one and a half hours .
it seemed to be out of trouble .
and that got me a little bit annoyed , because I remember it &apos;s a little bit too small , but even if you remember that there &apos;s a real problem . why do we use memory more or less ?
so I want you to think about an experiment about thinking .
if you take your next vacation , when you know that the end of the vacation you &apos;re going to be destroyed , and you &apos;re going to swallow a drug that you forget .
do you think about the same vacation ?
if you took a different kind of vacation between your two self , you had to think about it , and it wasn &apos;t easy , because if you only think about time , you &apos;d get an answer .
the reason why we have to choose between the two selves and the other , the question that bothers us is to choose between ourselves .
now , two selves have different ideas about pleasure .
each of these two ideas of happiness corresponds to two selves .
so you ask yourself , how happy is it ? how happy is it ?
and then you ask yourself , &quot; How happy is it ? how happy is it ? &quot;
these moments of joy are complex .
how does emotion measure ?
by the way , we now have a rough notion of self @-@ experience as time is given .
and the pleasant life , the memory itself , is completely silent .
it &apos;s not a question of how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s a question of how happy it is .
radically different perceptions .
and if you can &apos;t tell the difference between these two ideas , I can &apos;t afford to live with each other , and that &apos;s why .
in recent years , self @-@ experience , and the differences between self @-@ happiness and memory are <unk> between the two .
the Gallup Organization recently ran a poll around the world where over half a million people were asked a question like this , and that was how they looked at their lives and how they looked at it , and this company had done other surveys .
in recent years , we &apos;ve learned about two kinds of happiness .
and I think what we &apos;ve learned is that they vary .
and you can tell if one person is happy about life , but you can &apos;t tell you how happy they are , and vice versa .
just to give you an idea of the connection , they &apos;re about 50 percent related .
which means when you see someone , you &apos;re told that his father has a high profile , can you know how tall this person is ?
well , you might have a basic idea , but it &apos;s very uncertain .
you can &apos;t determine .
if I were to say that somebody had their own life rate , he beat eight by 10 , you couldn &apos;t understand how happy they were .
so the connection is low .
we know what makes people happy .
we know that money is important , it &apos;s important .
we know that happiness is something that takes place through the people we love , and it takes time to stay with them .
there are other factors , but this is the main factor .
so if you want to make both of them happy , you have to throw them away and do something different .
what I mean by that is , we shouldn &apos;t treat pleasure as living .
that &apos;s the difference between the two .
now , one of the reasons why we don &apos;t understand very much about pleasure is that we see life differently than we do .
so when you ask people in California how happy they are , you &apos;re not going to get the right answer .
because when you have a situation like this , you think it &apos;s a little bit fun , and you live in Ohio .
when you want to live in California with a lot of pleasure , you think about the differences between California and elsewhere , like climate change .
and it turns out that the climate conditions aren &apos;t important , and it &apos;s not important to think about how happy they are and how happy they are .
but since the real world is dominated by ideas , some people might have come up with a conclusion that it &apos;s moved to California .
they moved to California for a better life , and they were tracking their progress , and it would be a pretty interesting thing .
their experience is not going to be happier .
we all know that .
but one of the things that happened was they thought they were so happy , because when they think about it , they remembered that Ohio was a state of Ohio . and they felt that they made the right decision .
it &apos;s really hard to understand pleasure , and I hope I &apos;ve given you a basic idea , and understand how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . I have a question for asking you .
thank you very much .
a few weeks ago , we had a telephone , and you heard a fascinating phenomenon from the Gallup survey .
can you share it with us ? we have a couple of minutes .
Daniel <unk> : okay .
I found a very intriguing number from the Gallup world that came out of the Gallup world .
we found a phenomenon about self @-@ experience .
that &apos;s how much people feel about income .
and it turns out that for those of you who are living in less than a year @-@ olds in the United States , this is a very large part of a sample , and these are people who are quite modest , and they &apos;re less than 60 million dollars a year .
<unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
less than half a year @-@ olds are less happy , and they &apos;re happier than less .
and when income is over 60,000 , we get a horizontal line .
it &apos;s very difficult to see these flat lines .
obviously money doesn &apos;t buy a sense of self @-@ interest , but it doesn &apos;t have money for you , and we know that the depth of suffering is very clear .
for another self , memory itself , there &apos;s a narrative that you have .
the more you make , the more you get .
there &apos;s no relationship with emotion .
yet life , liberty and pursuit of pleasure is the goal of all Americans struggle .
and if you look at that , you know , it &apos;s going to turn our ideas into things like <unk> policies .
could the political characters in this country look like this and see it on the right @-@ hand side ?
AO : I think there &apos;s a place where people have known about pleasure and pleasure in policy .
but that &apos;s an idea that &apos;s an American population , and it &apos;s certainly true , but in the U.K. , it &apos;s <unk> , and the rest of the world remains .
and you start to realize that when you &apos;re thinking about policy , you &apos;re going to start thinking about pleasure .
and while this is going to take a moment , it &apos;s going to start thinking . what they &apos;re going to do is they &apos;re going to experience pleasure , or they &apos;re going to rate their life , and so very quickly , we &apos;re going to understand this .
it &apos;s a way of <unk> happiness , and there are many other ways of thinking about what you think , and what you think about is that your memory is still about yourself .
and I think within a few years , this will affect policy .
America has paid a tremendous amount of effort to measure the pleasant experience .
and I think that in 10 or 20 years , this will be part of the national data .
the issue for me is probably the most strategic policy issue in the next few years .
thank you very much for creating behavioral economics .
thank you very much .
my name is <unk> . I &apos;m a game designer .
I &apos;ve been designing online games for 10 years , and the goal of the next decade is to be able to get things like game play .
now , the reason I want to explain why I &apos;m saying this is that , if people have bigger , bigger games , and of course those of you in this room , and spend a lot of time on the game , you think I &apos;ve got more compelling .
people now play online games for about three billion hours a week , and people are now playing online games for three billion hours a week .
some of you might think it took too many time to spend it .
maybe there &apos;s a lot more , because there &apos;s a lot of pressing problems in the real world that we need to deal with .
and yet , according to the research that I have in the future , we spend less time in games .
three hundred and thirty @-@ six hours a week , the world &apos;s game is far less difficult to solve the real world problem .
in fact , I felt that in order to live better on the planet , in fact , I felt that in order to live on a better life on Earth , we needed a lot of games .
I &apos;ve done calculations , and the games we need are 10 million hours per week .
maybe it &apos;s counterintuitive , but I want to go back to this idea that if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , global conflict , obesity , obesity , obesity , and I believe that we need to be encouraged to play video games every week and at least 10 years .
actually , I &apos;m serious . I &apos;m not kidding .
and here &apos;s the reason why we bring this scene together as a form of human race to survive in the future .
this is a portrait taken by <unk> .
he wanted to capture some of the emotion changes in play , so he put them in front of the game .
this is the classic expression of a player .
now , if you &apos;re not a game player , you don &apos;t really make sense of what this photograph is .
you might feel that pressing , <unk> fear , rather than <unk> , or focus on solving a problem .
if you &apos;re a game player , you realize that some of the wrinkles around the corner of the eye , including the <unk> of the fabric around the corner , and that &apos;s a very optimistic sign , and the eyebrow <unk> up .
this suggests that this game is about to get epic performance in the game .
you &apos;ve heard this term before , which means some of you are a player .
this epic victory is a result , but it &apos;s very exciting to get this victory before you even think of it .
it &apos;s even beyond your imagination .
and when you do that , you will be struck by the skills of your own skill , which is what &apos;s called the <unk> epic .
and this player is about to fulfill this kind of victory .
and at the same time , this is what we want to do when we deal with all of the problems that we face around the world , and it &apos;s people who look at things like <unk> .
now , unfortunately , when we deal with the <unk> of our daily life , what we often see is this expression .
and I normally call this a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and it turns out to be this one that I made out of my own life , or can I see it out of it ? OK .
and that &apos;s the kind of <unk> that I made , that I was not very good at living expressions .
and this is one of the older communities in California , one of my Ph.D. in Berkeley , and I read a Ph.D. from my Ph.D. &apos; s research as to why we feel that virtual reality is better than the real world .
and it &apos;s also a challenge for a lot of players .
we felt like we could not adapt to real life in games .
and I don &apos;t think that <unk> is success , neither of which is on a par or something .
we do have a lot more success in the world , but here &apos;s what we call an internal motivation , the intrinsic inspiration and collaboration .
when we &apos;re in the world , I think we can do the best of ourselves , and when we see a message , we &apos;re going to be able to help other people and solve the problem , and we &apos;re going to be brave enough to stand up and continue .
but in real life , when we &apos;re confronted with failure , we don &apos;t normally feel that .
we tend to think that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
at this point , we didn &apos;t have a game where we felt that there was no way in the game .
and this is what I studied when I was a graduate student .
could a game make us think , can we do anything ?
how can we move that feeling from game to work in the real world ?
so I looked at games like World of Warcraft , and these are the ideal platforms for dealing with collaborative issues .
and I noticed that some of these things made the epic triumph of the game play possible .
the first thing is , whenever you show up in these online games , particularly World War II games , there &apos;s a lot of different characters in which they trust you , and they help you to save the world .
but it &apos;s not all the tasks that look like this , but it &apos;s just the ones that match your current level .
so you have the power to do it .
designers will not give you a mission you can &apos;t do right now .
but finishing this task requires your ability to limit , so you have to do everything you can , and in World of Warcraft , everybody has a position .
there &apos;s not an audience that has always been a very special and important thing to do .
and there &apos;s a lot of people in the world who can work together .
wherever you go , there are thousands of people waiting to be working with you .
in real life , there are thousands of partners around our fingertips that are not as easy .
there &apos;s a wonderful story about the problem , and the stories attract us , and motivating us .
and at the same time , there &apos;s a positive response for any effort that we make .
you &apos;ve heard about the rise , the rise of the hierarchy , the ability to put more intelligence together .
and we don &apos;t have that kind of constant feedback .
for example , when I walk down this stage , I don &apos;t have the ability to speak up , the crazy ideas , the crazy ideas , the ability to get 20 plus 20 .
in real life , I didn &apos;t get any rewards .
in networks like World War II , like &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; and &quot; World of Warcraft &quot; is a very 24 @-@ year @-@ olds , because we can continue to win and win , and that &apos;s because of the fact that we &apos;re stuck playing around the world .
because it &apos;s better than reality .
and so far , since World War II , game players in World War II have spent countless tens of thousands of years trying to figure out all kinds of online problems , all kinds of online problems , all sorts of things .
it &apos;s not a bad thing .
but it sounds like a bad thing .
and we wrote these numbers , and we started walking upright Homo erectus around the age of 10,000 years ago .
this is the first upright @-@ walking primates .
so when we &apos;re talking about how much time we spend on the game , the only way that makes it reasonable is to think about how much time we spend on the evolution of mankind , and how extraordinary it is .
and to think that way is right , because you realize that by spending a lot of time games , we can change our ability to be people , and we can change our ability to be human .
we are moving towards a more integrated and robust species .
it &apos;s true . I believe it .
this is an interesting survey from a group of researchers from Carnegie Mellon at a university in an atmosphere where young people , today , are playing in an atmosphere where young people are 21 years old , and on average , 10,000 hours of online play .
now , 10,000 hours is an interesting value because of two reasons .
first of all , children from grade five to high school are <unk> hours , and of course you have to do well on time .
and we had a parallel processing data that looked at education , and it showed that young people were doing a good game player and spent the same time learning as they were learning in school .
some of you must have read the book &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so your insights about success are not that strange , 10,000 hours of success .
the law is based on cognitive science , and if we spend 10,000 hours in the age of 21 , we should be able to do something else , and then we &apos;d be able to get a huge success on these things .
we &apos;re going to become world experts in whatever we do .
now , what we &apos;re looking at is the full generation of young people .
the biggest question is , what are the players doing ?
if we can answer the answer , we &apos;re going to eradicate an unprecedented human resource .
they &apos;re the ones that we have today that spend at least one @-@ hour online game players .
they were incredibly adept at performing things for five billion people .
and in the next 10 years , there &apos;s a group of people who are really good at some kind of player in the next decade .
if you &apos;re not familiar , then I tell you , it &apos;s happening .
the game industry has been evolving so far , and it has become ubiquitous , and it has moved from the Internet to the wireless network of mobile phone players , particularly from India , from China , from China , from Brazil , in the same platforms .
in the next decade , there will be a billion new players in the next decade .
and we have 15 game players .
so I started thinking , where are these games going to lead us ?
and I felt that there were four aspects of this , and the first is the positive , the positive , the positive , the emergency .
think of it as an object @-@ edge self @-@ inspiring .
the existential challenge was to combine the mind of the obstacles immediately .
the game players always believe that you can &apos;t make a difference .
the gamers are not isolated .
they &apos;re very good at creating social structures .
an interesting survey showed that we prefer people who play with us , even though they beat me up , it &apos;s the same .
and the reason for that is that in the game , we accumulate trust , because in the game process , we accumulate trust .
and the reason why we trust that is because they spend the same time with the same rules , with the same goals , we &apos;re going to fight side by side .
in this case , games can actually create coordinate and collaboration .
and we &apos;re going to create a more robust social network .
happiness is productivity , and I love that .
the World War II player spent 22 hours on average , as part @-@ time games are part @-@ time games .
it &apos;s because , when we play games , we &apos;re having a lot of pleasure , or we &apos;re having a lot of fun .
as humans , we like to do things that are difficult , but it &apos;s more interesting .
if there &apos;s a right task for the player , they &apos;re constantly trying to play .
and finally , epic meaning .
the game player likes to carry on in the <unk> of the story of man .
any little bit of routine that you do will be part of that final vision , and you &apos;ve heard about Wikipedia , the world &apos;s biggest <unk> , the world &apos;s biggest <unk> .
the second largest bank in the world is &quot; World of Warcraft , &quot; about 80,000 articles .
every month , 500 million people are using it .
there &apos;s more information about World of Warcraft .
and it created an extraordinary story .
and it &apos;s also a story about &quot; World of Warcraft . &quot;
and this is the example of bringing those four superpowers to one thing : players are a highly licensed , highly open community .
they all think they &apos;re capable of changing the world , and they all think they &apos;re capable of changing the world .
but the problem is they believe they can change the world , not the real world .
and that &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist , <unk> <unk> .
his job is so extraordinary . he study why people spend so much time and energy and money online play .
and he said , &quot; Look , we &apos;re seeing lots of people who live in virtual worlds and game play . &quot;
he was an economist , so he was rational .
and he said ...
unlike me , I &apos;m a game designer , and I &apos;m alive .
and he also said that play makes sense , because the game players get more in the virtual world than they do in real life .
they can have better social relations in the video game , and they can get much better outcomes than real life &apos;s real life .
so , he said that for the game players , spend more time in the virtual world than it is in real time .
now I still think that &apos;s rational .
but nevertheless , it &apos;s not the best option .
we have to start making real world society like a game .
so I got inspiration from something that happened 25 years ago .
these are old dice , made from bone ash .
and before we designed the game controller , we humans have had the dice to make a sheep joint .
this is the earliest game equipment ever devised .
if you &apos;re familiar with the work of ancient Greek historians , like the Greek historian , you will know what the history of this game is and why .
the game was , in particular , the night sky was invented by the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and apparently , there was a terrible famine in history , and the king decided to do some crazy things they had to do .
people were suffering and fighting each other .
it &apos;s a crisis . they need an extreme solution .
according to the fact , they invented the dice , and they created a policy around the country , where everyone could eat , but the next day , everybody could play .
people listen to dice because games are very attractive to get us through this self @-@ satisfaction situation where people forget the fact that they don &apos;t have food .
and the next day , people were playing through the game , and the next day they were eating .
and it &apos;s been said by the way that the people who live in countries have spent 18 years doing this kind of thing and playing games , and they have great famine .
and that &apos;s how we see games today .
we are suffering from games .
we get away from video games to experience what we need , what we don &apos;t need , what we need .
and this process can be done forever .
this is very exciting .
in August , in 18 years , the great famine of the great famine had no better or better signs , so the king decided to play the last game in the country .
he divided the national average into two groups .
together , they play one of the games of the dice , and they &apos;re going to be on a journey of adventure .
they &apos;re going to go out and look for a new place , and the people that live in that world and live in a place where they live , where the people that are leaving , are causing the burden of the civilization @-@ state .
it sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but recently , DNA evidence shows the ancestors of the Roman Empire -- the same thing as the <unk> .
and scientists have recently discovered this crazy story in history .
and geologists also found evidence that there was a global cooling record for 20 years on the planet , and that would explain this big famine .
so this seemingly crazy story is real .
they were able to get their culture out of the game and get them out of the game for 18 years , and they were able to figure out how to get people together through the game , and they were able to save the entire civilization .
we can do it in this way .
people started in 1994 , and they were playing World of Warcraft .
this is the first real @-@ time game in World of Warcraft , 16 years ago .
this is an 18 @-@ year @-@ old pair of dice , and we played the dice .
so I would argue that we &apos;re ready to accept a game that can change our lives .
this is the discovery of a half of civilization , looking for the new world , and we now have six billion hours of video games .
half of us play video games every single hour until we get to the real world .
and you might ask , &quot; How can we solve real @-@ world problems in video games ? &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is why I &apos;ve spent the last couple of years focusing on what I &apos;ve been doing , what I &apos;ve been working on , and what I call the <unk> Institute for the future .
this is an ad that we ran in an office in the <unk> office , and it gave us a sense of how we think about the future .
we don &apos;t try to predict the future .
but we &apos;re going to create the future .
we had imagined the best possible results , and we wanted to see that by trying to get people to make that vision reality .
we crave the epic triumph , and we gave people the way to win .
and I want to tell you a little bit about the kinds of game that I do , and they &apos;re all trying , and try and give it to the future of people who can create their own epic success , give them a few ways .
this is &quot; The <unk> World . &quot;
and the game was made in 2007 .
this is a online game where you have to survive without oil .
it &apos;s a fiction shortage , but we &apos;re going to spend a lot of the content inside , and you think that &apos;s true , and it &apos;s going to impact your real @-@ life situations in real life , so we don &apos;t have the oil riots , so when you open the game and tell us what &apos;s going to happen in real time , and we &apos;re going to give you that information about what &apos;s happening .
in 2007 , there were 17 million people on this game , and we tracked these people for the next three years .
and what I can tell you is that this is a very revolutionary experience .
no one wanted to change their way of life , or because they felt like they were <unk> the environment , or because they felt it <unk> .
but if you ask them to look at an extraordinary experience and tell them that we &apos;ve <unk> our oil .
it &apos;s going to be a wonderful story you &apos;ve heard about and an extraordinary experience .
challenge yourself , see how you can live most of the game players , keep the ones that they &apos;re used to in the game , keep the players from the game .
in the next game of saving the world , our choices are harder than the oil shortage .
we did a game at the University of Illinois called <unk> , and we did a game called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the hypotheses for this game are that supercomputers live for 23 years .
this supercomputer was called the <unk> projection system .
people were playing in a game like Jerry <unk> .
you know , you &apos;ve got a <unk> film , you &apos;ve got an astronaut , a scientist , a scientist , and they &apos;ve got some skills to save the world .
in the game that we designed , we didn &apos;t have the five team models that we designed to be one of the four @-@ year @-@ olds , and your job is to develop the next generation of energy , food , security , social security .
we had 8,000 people play this game , and we played it for eight weeks .
and they came up with 500 crazy , but very creative solutions , and if you could go online and go to Google <unk> , you could see the results .
and the last game we &apos;re going to do is go online in March , which is a game done with the World Bank .
and if you can do that , you &apos;re going to be certified by the World Bank , and you &apos;re going to be the <unk> of the World Bank .
by working with sub @-@ Saharan Africa , we &apos;re inviting them to participate in social innovation .
the game is more like a cartoon . we have an equilibrium with skill , like deep <unk> , knowledge , <unk> , vision and <unk> .
and I invite you to actually share this game with the young people everywhere , and especially in the developing world , where the game can connect people together , so they can start thinking about their own social enterprises , and they can really benefit from the game .
I &apos;m going to finish .
I want to ask a question .
what will happen in the future ?
we have this great game player that we play , and we have these games that may be some of the experiments that we &apos;re going to do in the future , but nothing has ever saved .
and I want you to agree that my point is that players are a huge human @-@ powered <unk> ; we can get them to work in the real world , and the game is because of this , the game is a revolution .
and we have these wonderful superpowers , the ability of happiness , the ability to organize socially , and the ability to invest in property , and to be optimistic , and to live in epic life .
and I really hope that we can play with the good game @-@ <unk> on the next century .
I want you to join us in making or supporting games like this .
and when I look forward to the next 10 years , I &apos;m very sure that first of all , we can create any kind of future we can imagine , and second , we can play any game we want to play with .
let &apos;s start changing the world .
thank you .
and I want to share with you a couple of months ago a big discovery that I was working on in an Italian magazine .
when I was writing , I always stuck with the dictionary next , and I had published it and realized that I hadn &apos;t found anything in my life that I had found in the dictionary .
let me read this in a very specific way .
the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the helpless , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the injured , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the strength , the loss of suffering , the loss of suffering , the loss of suffering , the body .
contrary : robust , strong , empowered , empowered .
and I read this book and I read it to a friend , and I started laughing at it , and it was ridiculous that when the books were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , I <unk> myself up , and I had to stop <unk> myself with the words and the stigma .
and yes , my old <unk> dictionaries turned up too , and I think it &apos;s a pretty old version .
but in fact , it was a matter of fact that in the &apos; 80s , I was supposed to be able to live in an environment outside of my family , to form a sense of awareness and connections with the kids around me .
and thankfully , I hadn &apos;t done that .
what I mean by that is , by <unk> the dictionary of the <unk> of disability , I can tell you that the world I live in doesn &apos;t recognize the same physical world as my own disability , that the physical disability world has no positive factors , but today , I &apos;m living in an adventure for all of my life .
so , I looked at online <unk> , and in 2009 , I looked at the online <unk> , and I looked forward to some important changes .
I &apos;m going to show you a new version of the <unk> of disability .
unfortunately , the explanation wasn &apos;t much better than that .
and the other word &quot; approaching &quot; is especially unpleasant : they &apos;re <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s not just a few words .
when people use that negative vocabulary , they actually reflect on the way people think about disability .
what &apos;s remarkable about this is that the people who describe the vocabulary of the disabled , the value of the individual , and the process of their value .
our language affects our mind and the way we see the world , the way we see it , the way we see it .
in fact , there are many ancient forms of the ancient Greeks , ancient forms of the ancient world , believing in the power of speech , because once it &apos;s said , it &apos;s true .
so , what kind of thing do we want to be able to make something out of the person that doesn &apos;t have the ability ?
sometimes , we just give them names for an adult or a child , but we can give them possibilities , put them on their own , put them on their own .
don &apos;t we want to open our hearts ?
and one of my life was this guy who opened the door of my heart , a doctor who took care of me as a child , and he worked at the <unk> A , Dave <unk> at the <unk> Institute .
his name is <unk> , and it &apos;s an Italian @-@ American woman , and obviously his name is a lot of Americans , and it &apos;s kind of difficult for him to call him &quot; P doctor . &quot;
and P physicians always carry an <unk> , and he was a very well @-@ educated , <unk> , with his kids .
besides training courses , I spent a lot of time in his hospitals .
I &apos;m going to do it again in colors , in colors , in rich colors , flexible tape , and do it again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again , and then I &apos;m like , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I &apos;ve even given them names .
I was a five @-@ year @-@ old kid , and he didn &apos;t let me go for those who didn &apos;t let me go . and of course , I didn &apos;t pay that .
and then one day , P physicians , when I was in my <unk> , saw me <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then he said to me , &quot; Amy , you &apos;re such a tough girl , I felt that you could tie these tape together .
when you broke , I rewards you for 100 dollars .
obviously , this is a trick from the P doctor , and he just wanted me to do these things that I couldn &apos;t really do , and it turned out to be the most abundant <unk> in all the patients who were five years old , but P physicians did have done something , and that was the fact that I hated a whole new agenda , and I hated it .
today , I &apos;ve been thinking about how big a strong young girl , P &amp; amp ; quot ; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to my own self @-@ knowledge , and I &apos;ve been able to realize that my inner vision is <unk> , my future .
this is an example from the P doctor , which explains that an adult who has power can light a child &apos;s potential .
but in the case of the <unk> dictionary , our language does not allow us to turn the things we want to see and not allow the disabled to realize they &apos;re actually capable of being capable .
the technology is bringing social development , and our language is not growing up .
and of course , from medicine &apos;s point of view , my fake legs , <unk> my vision , the <unk> of the elderly , the replacement for the elderly , the kinds of technologies that allow people to combine and apply them to the natural world , and allow them to the circumstances of our physical world to the physical world .
so technology is showing us a longer @-@ lasting truth , and that is that every one of us is very powerful , and that is the ability to contribute to society and to adapt to the best of our fellow capital .
talking about human adaptation , and I felt really interesting , because people always wanted me to get over the topic of <unk> , and one of the things I want to do today is to get a little bit out of the way , to get out of adversity , and to me , it &apos;s a little bit uncomfortable when I start thinking about it .
and one of the things that came out of adversity is that success , or pleasure is at the other end of a difficult experience , and that experience itself is not about success and pleasure , as if , in fact , the reason I &apos;ve been successful is because I &apos;ve been around a series of challenges that I &apos;ve been facing as an amputation .
but in fact , the challenges really changed us , and on the course of our journey , we had this change that was possible in our bodies , possible in our bodies , and perhaps both .
and what I want to suggest is that it &apos;s a good thing to face .
in the face of adversity , we shouldn &apos;t think of it as obstacles to surround it and continue our lives .
in fact , adversity is part of our lives .
I imagined adversity as my own shadow .
sometimes it looks big , sometimes it &apos;s tiny , but it &apos;s still around me .
and of course , I &apos;m not trying to <unk> people &apos;s values and meaning .
we &apos;re destined to be <unk> in our lives to be <unk> and challenging each of us , but the question we &apos;re focusing on is not whether you &apos;re going to go to adversity , but how to face it .
so our responsibility is not simply to simply let people care about their lives in the fields of <unk> , but to make them <unk> out of adversity .
when we let our kids feel that we don &apos;t have a comfortable situation , we actually hurts them .
the objective of medicine is to determine whether I &apos;m a disabled person , to think about whether or not I &apos;m a disabled person , is there a difference between the two .
in fact , one of the only problems I &apos;ve ever been faced with is the world &apos;s understanding and description of the injustice of my world .
we want to be able to protect the people that we care about , and we &apos;re going to be able to take the <unk> and diagnose them , or sometimes , to make predictions for their future lives , but we have to pay attention to whether or not we &apos;re going to destroy these people .
perhaps , people are used to focus only on their flaws , and to think about how to repair those limitations , and they &apos;re more likely to harm than the physical disability alone .
we don &apos;t see disabled people in a single way , and we don &apos;t recognize their ability , and it &apos;s certainly difficult for them to see the conditions themselves .
we can actually evaluate the value of a society &apos;s value effectively .
so our eyes should not be limited to the <unk> of the disabled , but they should be aware of their value as human beings .
in addition , some of the most important disabilities and some of the constraints of human creativity have been connected .
so , the tough years of suffering are the ones that shouldn &apos;t be <unk> or <unk> , and that &apos;s not the case that we should avoid <unk> or hide , and we should be looking for opportunities in adversity .
in fact , the reason I want to tell you about this is that adversity is not something that we should embrace , and we should embrace it and embrace it and I used it as a <unk> term , or even dance .
maybe , if we can think of adversity as something that is inherently natural and non @-@ human , and it doesn &apos;t exist for us .
this year , we celebrated the 20th anniversary of Darwin , and when Darwin wrote the birth of a species 150 years ago , he <unk> the truth about the human nature .
and what he said was that the species that were surviving were not the strongest , not the smartest , but the outside environment .
conflict is the mother of the father .
Darwin and others like yourselves have revealed that this transformation of human nature is transformed by the horror of the human soul .
and again , the greatest capacity for human beings is shifting and adapted .
maybe , before we get too far , we don &apos;t know what it is .
and maybe that &apos;s what will happen in adversity , a sense of self and individual ability .
so we can give ourselves a gift .
we can think of adversity as an opportunity to change .
it wasn &apos;t a tough day .
adversity is a change , and we don &apos;t have time to adapt to it .
and I think the biggest challenge we create for ourselves is this notion of &quot; <unk> . &quot;
okay , so what is it about <unk> ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with <unk> .
I know what is a normal <unk> , what is a typical <unk> , but I don &apos;t know what <unk> is , if there &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re interested in them ?
I don &apos;t think so .
if we don &apos;t invest in the pursuit of <unk> , we invest in different possibilities , we invest in different possibilities , we invest in different kinds of abilities , take risks , and many of our children &apos;s potential to be much better , and they &apos;re going to be able to benefit from their communities .
anthropologists tell us that as humans , we always hope that the people in our community are helpful , the ability to contribute .
Neanderthals , around 60,000 years ago , were a good proof that Neanderthals were raising their society , because they believed that the life of older people was worthwhile for their society .
older people never see themselves as useless , but they &apos;re considered as valuable .
and one day , a few years ago , I was in my hometown of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of Pennsylvania , and I was standing next to the <unk> .
because I was in the summer , and I was wearing his shorts .
I came up with a man &apos;s voice in behind me , but isn &apos;t that Amy <unk> <unk> ?
and I turned around , and I realized that I had no idea .
and I said , &quot; Mr. <unk> excuse me , have we met ? I &apos;ve forgotten you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; Well , you &apos;re not going to remember the meeting we met . &quot;
because I was <unk> you out of your mother &apos;s uterus .
that &apos;s what I met .
of course , at the end , I thought .
this man was a doctor , and I only knew that one man told me by the time she told me that I was a late night .
and that &apos;s when my mom took care of her doctor on a vacation , so she ended up being a doctor , and she didn &apos;t know anything about me .
when I was born , there were none of my <unk> , my feet , and Father <unk> , he had to convey two bad things .
and he said to me , &quot; I gave the diagnosis to your parents , and I said , &quot; You &apos;re never going to walk , and you &apos;re never going to be able to live your life forever , but ever since then , you &apos;re trying to make me a life @-@ free . &quot;
and one of the great things he did was he cut all the stories from my childhood and all the stories about me , including myself when I was in second grade , when I was in a graduate student and a woman called <unk> , and I got to go to medical school with all the stories that I had done in my local medical school , and I took them to do it .
and he called these stories , &quot; The X factor in his curriculum called the <unk> of the human mind . &quot;
none of the medical diagnostics could explain how powerful this will be , how powerful will it affect the quality of a person &apos;s life .
and Luke went on to me and said , &quot; Well , there &apos;s been a lot of other people who <unk> me , and according to my experience , even if there &apos;s a little bit of support for them , they can do it themselves . &quot;
see , Tony &apos;s thought changed .
he realized that there was a difference between the medical diagnosis and the way a person attempted it .
and a few years later , I had a certain shift , like , if you were 15 years old and asked me if I had a different prosthetic hand than I am today , I would have said yes .
because I wanted to get that kind of security .
but if you ask me the same question today , I &apos;m going to do it .
and that &apos;s because the experience that I have with my prosthetic arm has a big impact .
maybe , I &apos;m out of my gut , because , in the people I met , the people that opened my door to the new world , they &apos;re much more <unk> than people in my heart .
see , what you need is somebody who can show you their strength .
the human spirit is embracing , and if you can give somebody another keys , let him turn his keys on the key , and at the moment , you can use the keys to create a door for someone else , which is to educate them in the best way .
because you &apos;re teaching them to open up the doors to the new world .
and in fact , the significance of the word &quot; education <unk> &quot; comes from the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and that is , you know , the thing that <unk> the potential within it .
so , what kind of potential do we want to <unk> ?
there was a case in the 1960s where the British children were from elementary school to secondary school .
in the U.K. , we call <unk> , and in the United States , we call it <unk> <unk> .
the exam students divided them up from below A &apos;s , B , C , D attendance .
there &apos;s a better teacher , etc .
this is a three @-@ month trial where students are supposed to be called D , and they &apos;re told they &apos;re A &apos;s student , and they &apos;re told they &apos;re really smart , three months at the end of the trial , and the result of this group has become <unk> .
and of course , there &apos;s a flip side to this study , and that is , you know , those who are supposed to be called A &apos;s , and they &apos;re told they &apos;re D @-@ C @-@ D .
three months at the end of the trial .
many of them have dropped out .
and one of the key points for this experiment was that the teachers who were involved in the trial weren &apos;t aware of it .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that the students were killed .
the teachers were just told , what is A <unk> , and what is a professor of D ?
so , I think the true disability is a soul that has been beaten , a soul that has no hope for the future , a soul that can &apos;t perceive a great soul , a lack of wonder , a soul that lost human imagination .
and if , we can get the human spirit out there and hope that the soul can see the beauty of ourselves and the beauty of others , and the imagination , then we can even use our own power .
as long as a soul still has those qualities , it creates an infinite possibility and a new way of life .
I want to leave you with one poem by the end of the century , which is the 14th century poet <unk> , a poem by a friend , Jacques Cousteau , who told me his name was &quot; A god , &quot; which only knows four words , &quot; each child knows that God doesn &apos;t exist as four words , as opposed to four words .
dancing with me . thank you .
and I want you to imagine now that you can imagine a wearable robot that could give you a superhero , or a wheelchair user interface again .
we call this exoskeleton in Berkeley .
there &apos;s nothing else you can wear in the morning , and it &apos;s going to give you extra strength , it &apos;s going to break your speed , like , control .
it actually <unk> humans and machines .
but not only that -- it will combine and connect you with the outside world , connecting to other devices .
and that &apos;s not just the slightest idea .
to show you what we &apos;re doing right now , we &apos;re talking about American soldiers , and they &apos;re about 100 pounds of weight on their back , and they &apos;re still asking for more equipment .
obviously , this leads to some of the back @-@ to @-@ end problems -- 30 percent of the soldiers have injury -- chronic back injury .
so we thought we should face this challenge and create an exoskeleton to help solve this problem .
so let me tell you a little bit about <unk> -- that &apos;s the human body loads .
soldiers : after I made an exoskeletons , I could carry over 200 pounds of walking in complex terrain .
it &apos;s flexible design that allows people to go deep , <unk> and flexibility .
it feels what I want to do , where I think about it , and then raise my strength and my strength .
Alan Kay : we are partner with our industry and ready to bring in this new exoskeleton this year .
this is real .
now let &apos;s turn to the wheelchair itself , and this is a very personal part .
there are estimated that there are 240 million users in the world .
about one percent of the population .
this is a <unk> estimate .
what we &apos;re going to talk about now is that very young people with spinal cord injury are dying -- 20 , 30 years old , 40 years old -- hit a wheelchair as the only choice .
and it &apos;s also making the numbers grow .
and the only choice , roughly -- when someone has a stroke or something else -- is a wheelchair .
in fact , 500 years , it &apos;s been a very successful introduction , and I must say .
so , I think we &apos;re starting to write new stories about mobility .
now let me introduce you to the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who had been hurt 19 years ago by a spinal cord injury , and that led her over 19 years to not walk , until now .
Amanda <unk> : thank you .
<unk> : I said , &quot; Amanda is wearing our <unk> . &quot;
it has sensors .
they send signals to the back of her back @-@ end computers .
at the same time , there &apos;s a battery pack , and there &apos;s a rear @-@ powered battery in her <unk> , including her <unk> motor , which allows her to go up naturally .
Amanda : I was the pinnacle of my life when I was 24 years old , and I fell asleep and I was paralyzed .
and at that moment , I lost all of the feelings and activity below the pelvis .
soon after , a doctor came into my ward and said , &quot; Amanda , you can &apos;t walk anymore . &quot;
that was 19 years ago .
he deprive me of the hope .
now , since adaptive technology , I was able to learn how to ski again , climb , even hand @-@ <unk> .
but there was nothing that made me walk , until now .
thank you .
<unk> : as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down , and it &apos;s been discussed .
it &apos;s in our hands , we have all the potential , to transform our children &apos;s lives -- not just for soldiers , but for <unk> and all the wheelchair users , but for everybody .
Amanda : thank you .
in New York , I &apos;m the director of the nonprofit sector .
in the midst of trying to kill the poverty , I was also sort of a volunteer fire , and I decided to follow the conductor .
in our little town , in a place where volunteers have been successful , you have to go very early to where there &apos;s a possibility .
I remember the first fire .
I &apos;m the second volunteer , and I &apos;m probably going to be able to get involved in this .
but you also have to run the other volunteers , first of all , to get the job distribution to you .
and when I came to the end , he was looking through and <unk> and talking about the worst day of her life .
she stood in her pajamas and <unk> , and her house was hanging out .
another volunteer named me for the first time was a volunteers named <unk> <unk> , and he was distributed , and he was murdered to kill the puppy dogs and rescued the <unk> .
<unk> ! I &apos;m fed up .
it &apos;s a lawyer or a <unk> for life to tell someone how to go deep and live a living puppy , because he &apos;s better than me .
okay , I &apos;m going to turn on .
voice 10 : my voice is calling .
he said , &quot; <unk> . I need you to do it .
I want you to go upstairs , and I want you to take a <unk> for this woman . &quot;
really , I swear .
this is not an image of my mind , but I went upstairs , and I walked up to the bottom , and I went through the actual firemen , and they kind of chased me out , and took a pair of shoes .
I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m not a hero .
and I took my assignment to the front door , and I went to the front door , and I met this guy , Mr. <unk> , who was the dog that he had .
we walked to the front door , and there was no accident , and he was more concerned than I had .
a few weeks later , we received a letter from <unk> , and thank you for saving her family .
and she talked specifically about this <unk> little , even someone made a pair of shoes for her .
whether I &apos;m working in &quot; <unk> , &quot; or me as a volunteer <unk> , I saw a lot of very generous <unk> , and I also saw how different the courage and compassion would be .
you know what I learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
and when I look around at the success or the people who are going to succeed , you all have this amazing success , and I want to remind you , &quot; Don &apos;t wait . &quot;
don &apos;t wait for your first million people to start changing lives .
if you &apos;ve got something to give you , it &apos;s time to start .
it doesn &apos;t feed the poor .
let &apos;s take an example .
not every single day , we have the opportunity to save lives , but every day we have the opportunity to impact the lives of others .
come on : get those shoes saved .
thank you .
Bruno : mark , Mark , come back .
thank you .
I &apos;ve just come back from a community that has the secrets of human nature .
in this community , women &apos;s leadership , have sex with each other , and play is the next day -- and play is a serious thing .
no , it &apos;s not about burning men , it &apos;s not about San Francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your close relatives .
this is the world of bonobos when the chimps of bonobos are in Congo .
the chimps and bonobos are the closest relatives of our lives .
it means that we all have a common origin , a grandmother whose life lived about six million years ago .
now , the chimpanzee has nothing to do with their spouse .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve been so <unk> about the evolution of human evolution .
but what the bonobos showed us is the other side of the coin .
when the chimps are dominated by the bonobos .
the bonobos are so good for them to live together , to form a highly inclusive society , where lethal violence is not yet seen .
but unfortunately , the bonobos are one of the most known for all of us in our history .
they live deep inside the jungles of the Congo , so it &apos;s very difficult for them .
Congo is an <unk> @-@ <unk> farming -- a diverse biodiversity and beautiful land , but she has also a dark , violent scene that has been taking decades of life , as World War I.
and it &apos;s not surprising that this kind of damage that the chimps are living .
and the production of meat and the forest is that we can &apos;t afford a small habitat for the only people in the world today -- we can &apos;t even know if there &apos;s a small habitat .
and yet , on this land of violent and chaos , you can hear the dancing flames in the trees .
what are these close relatives ?
we know that they &apos;re <unk> , don &apos;t have war , so they have frequent , casual sex and sexual pleasure to handle conflict and social problems .
now I &apos;m not suggesting that this is the way to solve all of the problems -- because play is much more meaningful for a chimpanzee than if you &apos;re playing for a chimpanzee .
the bonobos are like humans , and they love play throughout their lifetime .
play is not just a child &apos;s game .
for us humans and bonobos , play is the basis of intimacy and training .
it also allows us to learn about trust and play .
it &apos;s a combination of creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about diversity -- dynamic interactions , diversity , behavior , diversity .
when you look at the <unk> of the bonobos , you see that there &apos;s a very evolved relationship to the cause of humans , dancing and rituals .
play is what makes us interconnected .
now I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you two clips from just wild to wild .
first of all , this is the sound of a chimpanzee -- I don &apos;t mean soccer .
here , two young females playing the game .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
that &apos;s the phrase , &quot; She &apos;s playing with the <unk> of his music . &quot;
I just think he likes that way , right ?
yes .
so it &apos;s very common to both chimps and humans .
and this video is really interesting because it turns out -- this is really interesting because it shows the creativity that brings things into play -- like the <unk> -- how games tend to seek trust and nurture -- and at the same time , infinitely .
but play is a <unk> process .
play is a <unk> process , and it can become many games , some games that are silent , imagination , imagination , imagination , <unk> -- maybe magic of play .
I want to show you , this is <unk> , a young female chimpanzee who is playing water .
and I think , like her , we play on ourselves , and we explore the boundaries of our inner world with us .
it &apos;s the <unk> of play that motivates us to explore , to drive us to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we have come up with are really the breeding ground for creativity .
so these are just the ones that give us this deep insight into our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , and in the future we need to embrace an increasingly challenging world that has never been creative and much more partnerships .
the secret is play is essential for all of these abilities .
in other words , play is the universal translator for the future .
we need play .
but are we going to play as hard as possible ?
play is not insignificant .
play is critical .
for the bonobos , it &apos;s not just the teeth and the teeth that exist .
it &apos;s not the most appropriate thing to play , but it &apos;s probably the most demanding of play .
so , my own primate , let &apos;s embrace the gift of this gift of evolution , and let &apos;s play with each other , and then re @-@ discovering the relationship and wonder .
thank you .
and I want you to think about the same day in 1979 , and the same moment , every single moment of a child ...
and then there was a whole family of parents who had lost one child .
now , I don &apos;t want you all to spend your time thinking about pregnancy because if you spend too much time thinking about it , you don &apos;t hear it .
so think about it a little bit .
so in this case , I want to take a moment to imagine that the sperm that carry the Y chromosome with the Y chromosome .
the other is the sperm that carry the X chromosome with the sperm that carry the X chromosome .
both survive , and both begin to grow .
let &apos;s take a look at this .
I became the two characters in the field that I was doing .
one actor is my anatomy .
I &apos;m a <unk> , and what I study is how humans respond to anatomy , whether it &apos;s human body , or animal bodies -- how they deal with body fluids , abstract bodies , how they think about bodies .
another actor is an activist as a role for patients -- or , as I sometimes say , as a doctor , as a doctor -- I am a radical advocate .
and what happened to me in my work was some of the challenges .
for example , some of the people I &apos;ve been exposed to are two people who share one body .
and there &apos;s also a number of patients who are more than people who are usually better than people .
in addition , a lot of the people that I was exposed to , their gender was different -- that they didn &apos;t have a standard male feature or female signature .
in general , the symptoms can be called <unk> .
there are many different forms .
let me give you a couple of examples where you can either be both male and non @-@ female .
one of the things that one could have a <unk> chromosome , and the <unk> gene on the Y chromosome , and we had the primitive <unk> that we had during the baby period that turned into the testicles .
so during the baby period , the testicles are <unk> .
but this individual lack the receptor to receive the hormone , so it doesn &apos;t respond to the testes .
this is a disorder called <unk> .
so there &apos;s a lot of testosterone , but you can &apos;t get a response .
so the body moves toward a female trend .
when the baby was born , she looked like a girl .
she was the girl , and she was raised as a young girl .
most of the time , until the puberty started to grow , she didn &apos;t have women &apos;s cycles , and we started to wonder what was wrong .
so they looked at her , and they found that she didn &apos;t have her ovaries , in fact , inside her body , and she carried the Y chromosome .
now , one of the big issues that I want to tell you is that this guy is actually not .
women , like men , have an organ called <unk> .
it &apos;s behind our bodies .
and <unk> is responsible for a male hormone .
like most women like me -- and I believe that I am a typical woman -- I don &apos;t actually know the composition of my chromosomes , but I think I should be a typical woman -- most women like me are actually sensitive .
we release testosterone , we respond to it .
as a result , there were women like me , and the brain exposed more testosterone than she had when she was born .
so gender is a very complex thing ; it &apos;s not just that the people who are <unk> are between men and women -- and in some ways , they can cover the whole range .
another couple of years ago , when I got a phone call from <unk> , a boy named boy who was born with a boy who was given birth to a boy who later had a girlfriend and a girlfriend who had a life of having sex with his girlfriend and his girlfriend , but recently , found himself in her body .
and all he had was a very extreme case called <unk> -- the 21 @-@ <unk> disorder .
he carried <unk> chromosomes , and he was active in the womb for a male hormone .
and as a result , he grew up males who had more typical male hormones in his brain .
so he was born and looked like a boy -- no one was skeptical .
only when he was 19 years old , when he started to encounter biological issues , it was actually during the period of their period when the doctors discovered that in fact , the inside of him was female .
all right , let &apos;s take a quick look at another one that might bring the gender characteristics .
some of the people on the chromosome are actually growing an organ called <unk> , which is a structure of the testes .
we don &apos;t know what it is .
so gender can be very painful .
the kids who have these physical characteristics -- whether it &apos;s a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> -- are often diagnosed with a surgical procedure , not because it &apos;s actually a healthy life .
because in many cases , their bodies are actually healthy .
they accept all sorts of surgery because they are under threat of our society .
or there &apos;s a typical physical structure in society , or what characteristics .
so the idea is that as a woman , you have to have the property of a woman , and so on , a black guy has to have a body of African <unk> in yours .
so we had this idea of a very simple idea .
and when we &apos;re confronted with something different , something that &apos;s different , that &apos;s surprising to us .
so there &apos;s a lot of our culture , and there &apos;s a lot of really the idea that comes out of date .
and our country is based on a very <unk> concept .
okay , so you can imagine how shocking that when your two children were born in a body .
and I recently met this situation where , at last year , Africa &apos;s track athletes , <unk> <unk> , were asked by the international competition in Berlin .
and a lot of reporters called me and asked me , &quot; What kind of test would they use to prove to you that <unk> or <unk> ? &quot;
so I had to explain to them that there was no way to test .
in fact , we now know that gender is complex , and we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t have a clear line between male or female or female or female lines , and that line is actually our own painting .
so what we &apos;re seeing now is that the more science is developing , the more we recognize these gender categories , the more we take for granted , the physical structures of structures , the more likely they are , the more <unk> them , the more blurry they are than we can imagine .
and it &apos;s not just about gender issues .
and it &apos;s also about racial issues , and this complexity is not something that our academics can describe .
as we can see , we have all sorts of hard terrain .
let &apos;s take an example , and in reality , we compare it with 95 percent of human DNA with gorilla .
and the fact that humans and chimpanzees are different than some of the DNA of a human and a gorilla .
the more technologies we have , the more technologies we have , the more difficult we have , we have to admit , are simply too simplistic .
and that &apos;s because of that , we &apos;re looking in the field of life .
one of the fields , for example , is that our culture , the culture of the United States today , lies at the origin of life and end .
we had a tough discussion about when we moved from one body to another , and we had a different human right to the baby .
we have a very controversial issue today -- maybe even beyond the internal debate in medicine -- about the question of when you think about death .
in the old days , our ancestors never stopped <unk> too much .
and most of all , if you stick a feather under your nose , you wouldn &apos;t see it .
if the feather wasn &apos;t moving , it would collapse them .
but what &apos;s happening now is that we want to take the organ of the deceased and transplant it to other people .
and as a result , we started asking questions about whether or not there was death , and that led us to a very difficult situation , where there was no simple <unk> .
now you might think , well , all of these categories of <unk> that may make you happy .
I &apos;m a progressive person in politics , and I have to admit that this change that <unk> me .
realizing that these institutions are more unstable than we thought , and I felt nervous .
and at the same time , I was nervous about democracy .
so to tell you about this level of tension , I would like to admit that I &apos;m a big fan of all people .
I know they &apos;re <unk> , they &apos;re <unk> , but they &apos;re great .
what I mean by that is , they &apos;re so heroic , fearless and engaged in their own business , and I have to re @-@ enjoy the music of that I founded every few years .
it &apos;s because what happened around the world in <unk> .
the leaders , I think they &apos;re the earliest <unk> , and that &apos;s why I love them .
they were against a anatomy and they were using a concept of 200 years .
and when you think about our source , what we call an idea of a system , and this monarchy is based on the idea of simplicity .
the ones below the old institutions don &apos;t have DNA , but they &apos;re following the idea of &quot; birth . &quot;
they have the concept of the aristocracy .
they think that people in politics should be on the basis of <unk> , from the <unk> to the father , from generation to son .
and the idea that the leaders were against this , and they were using a new kind of anatomical approach , and that &apos;s where they came from .
they got rid of the hierarchy of ideas , and the idea of their anatomy , the idea of the human race , and it was really a radical change .
and in a way , this reform is still happening , because they &apos;re part of the Enlightenment , and two things are common .
democratic institutions were being formed at the time , but they were also technological .
what &apos;s really striking is , if you look at the history of the leaders , a lot of them are interested in science and they &apos;re all interested in the world .
they dismiss the supernatural theory that they were excluded from the idea of supernatural power , because the idea of supernatural power was transmitted by a very vague idea .
they advocate for concept .
if you look at it , for instance , in the Declaration of Independence , they talk about the God of nature and nature .
they didn &apos;t mention the nature of God and God .
they mentioned the power of nature to explain who we are .
and so , as part of that , they bring us a concept , which is that people live in equal lives .
and they really prepared a great road for the future .
they had no idea what was going to happen , but they set us up , and that &apos;s great .
so what happened a few years later ?
for example , what happens to women in women &apos;s rights , their desire to vote according to the ideas that are founded by the leaders , and they say , &quot; We have <unk> and ovaries , which means that we don &apos;t vote properly , we don &apos;t have private property rights and private property rights . &quot;
the women &apos;s cause the effect .
and then there was a successful civil rights movement that came out of this quote , &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot;
we know that men have used to sign up for the civil rights movement route , &quot; I &apos;m a man . &quot;
in addition , the urge to <unk> and not should racism .
we see the same success cases where people are <unk> .
the problem is , of course , when we started looking at all citizens , we had to start questioning why we were maintaining a static line .
now , what I want to remind you is that I want to maintain some of the physical boundaries of the body , within our culture .
for example , I don &apos;t want to give fish the same rights as humans .
I don &apos;t want us to give up the distinction between the anatomy .
I don &apos;t want to , because kids can be allowed to have sexual activity , or they can be married .
so there &apos;s a line of anatomy , and there &apos;s meaning to us , I think , that should be kept .
but the big challenge is to try and figure out why we should preserve them , what they mean .
so let &apos;s go back to what we &apos;ve been talking about , and that &apos;s the first two of them that came out .
we have six and a half million people on the same day in 1979 .
let &apos;s imagine , Mary was born three months earlier , and she was born on June 1 , 1980 .
Henry , on the contrary , the foot was born in October of 1980 .
it was only three months after Mary was born , and the fact that she had a lot of rights over three months earlier , that she allowed the rights of sexual activity , the right to drink .
and Henry had to wait for his physiology to be different , just because he was born different .
we also found other kinds of secret rights .
well , Henry , because it was assumed to be a man -- although I hadn &apos;t told you that he was a <unk> genome -- because it &apos;s been hypothesized to be a man now , Mary didn &apos;t have to worry about it .
at the same time , Mary could not enjoy all states , like Henry , the same rights , the right to marriage .
Henry could get married in any state , but Mary is now married in a few states .
so some of the organisms that we insisted on , they have problems in many ways and they need to question .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do when our science is so advanced that we have to admit that the democracy on our anatomy may collapse ?
I don &apos;t want to lose hope to science , but at the same time , <unk> , that science is shaped by us .
so where do we go ?
it looks like our society has a utilitarian attitude : &quot; OK , I have to draw a line somewhere , and I &apos;m just drawn a line in the street . &quot;
but a lot of people get a very embarrassing place .
for example , Texas has a decision to marry a man that says you don &apos;t have Y chromosomes , and if you marry a woman , it means you have Y chromosomes .
in reality , they don &apos;t actually test the chromosomes .
but this was also surprising , because I told you the story of the non @-@ sensitive syndrome .
we looked at one of the founders of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Luther King , in his &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech , gave us a solution .
he believed that we should not judge a man &apos;s skin , but based on his <unk> .
and I said , &quot; Yeah , that sounds like a good solution . &quot;
but how do you practice it ?
how do you judge him on his own ?
and I also want to point out that I &apos;m not sure that we should be able to allocate human rights , because I have to acknowledge that some of the gold is more likely than some of the people I know .
and I also want to say that I know that some <unk> seem to be more <unk> than some 40 @-@ year @-@ olds in sexual relationships , more smart , more mature decisions .
so how do we measure that ?
it turns out it &apos;s very difficult .
and I wanted to know if the right thing could be scanned in the future -- maybe MRI can use MRI ?
do we really want to get there ?
I &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what I know is that it &apos;s important to think about the problems of democracy in the United States .
we &apos;ve done a very good job for the problem of democracy , and I think it &apos;s going to be better .
we were different from Iran , like a man who was obsessed with other men , and he could be killed unless he wanted to change his sexuality .
we didn &apos;t have that .
and I &apos;m pleased to say that we didn &apos;t have that -- to a surgeon , that was a matter of years ago , and he brought a hope that he could separate them apart and somehow make them famous .
but when I asked him why he wanted to do this surgery -- because this is a very high @-@ risk surgery -- he replied , in this country , this is going to be cruel , so he has to help them do it .
and I said to him , &quot; Well , do you think about <unk> instead of surgery ? &quot;
the United States , for kids like this , has made a big difference in their own traits , maybe they don &apos;t have to change their body .
so I think we should be leading this idea .
all right , by the way , I want to remind you that I &apos;ve talked a lot about what happened .
I also wanted to think about what it would look like , or what it would look like if we could get more mothers to participate .
and I also want to suggest that the feminist is a little bit radical , and that is that I think that different people might have different views , especially when we &apos;re used to thinking differently .
and I &apos;ve been interested in <unk> sex for years and years .
one of the things I &apos;m really interested in is to look at the differences between men and women around the world and the problem .
we know from a cultural study that we know that women , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- but rather more likely to be aware of complex social relations and more caring about the vulnerable of the population .
so if we think that way , we find an interesting situation .
a few years ago , when I read my graduate student , one of my <unk> knew that I was interested in -- I was a feminist , and I always -- he asked me a weird question .
he said , &quot; Tell me where the feminism is . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s the biggest question I &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is the result of everything that <unk> desire , and therefore , feminism is not feminine .
but further to interpret that , what I think is more is that maybe the feminist is in some way .
that is to say , maybe there are a few more women who think differently than men , and that makes us richer and more concerned about complex relations and more concerned about the vulnerable .
but the first thing that people have heard is how to protect each other &apos;s violence , and if we put it in this concept of <unk> , we &apos;re going to have a far beyond the idea of how to protect each other , but how to take care of each other .
maybe that &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to go in the future , and when we separate from each other , let &apos;s say democracy -- that &apos;s less about the individual identity of the individual , but more about the human relationship .
so when people are trying to create a better military operation , what we need to think about is what we do for other people .
thank you .
I &apos;m Jesse , and this is my <unk> .
but when I showed you what I had put in there , I had to do a very open , and that was , I was obsessed with clothing .
and I was looking for them and wearing them , and recently , I fell in love with pictures of them and blog about their blogs , and each of them has a different set of colorful , colorful clothing , the most appropriate place .
but I didn &apos;t buy anything new .
my clothes were bought from <unk> and <unk> .
Oh , thank you .
<unk> made me reduce the impact of clothing , and the impact of my wallet .
I could come across all sorts of interesting people ; I could save the money ; I got dressed as a <unk> ; and also shop becomes my private property .
and I thought , what will I find today ?
would it be my size ?
would it be my favorite color ?
would it be under 20 dollars ?
if the answer is yes , I feel I win .
and I want to go back to my <unk> and tell you what I &apos;ve got for the TED week .
what &apos;s the actual guy with so many clothes ?
so I &apos;m going to show you what happened to me .
and I took the liberty of putting it in .
the week of the week of the week was everything in my life .
and I would bet I would find all the clothes that I needed in my life .
since you see me right now , not that &quot; women in underwear &quot; walking around TED &quot; -- that suggests that I actually found something new .
and now I really want to show you my week of clothing .
does it sound good ?
and at the same time , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the life @-@ director , whether you believe it or not , these are the ideas that I &apos;m <unk> myself in &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so we started Sunday .
my name is &quot; Tiger . &quot;
you don &apos;t need to be <unk> with a lot of money .
and even you can do it for less than 50 dollars .
this whole suit , including the one I paid for , was the most expensive clothing I had in my pocket .
Monday : color is powerful .
in biology , it &apos;s almost impossible to wear red pants on a bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you attract other people .
the dominant ones are up to Tuesday .
I spent a lot of time in my life trying to do myself , and I went into the mainstream .
you do it yourself .
if you have the right person around you , they will not only understand , they will enjoy it .
Wednesday : embracing your <unk> .
and sometimes people tell me that I &apos;m dressed , or I reminded them of their seven @-@ year @-@ olds .
I liked to smile and said , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
Thursday : confidence is key .
if you think you &apos;re wearing something that looks good , then you &apos;re going to dress up pretty well .
if you don &apos;t think you wear something that looks good , you &apos;re pretty sure .
growing up , my mom told me this every day .
but I was 30 years old and knew what that meant .
and I &apos;m going to analyze you quickly .
if you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person , <unk> , there &apos;s nothing you can wear .
so everyone in this room has no reason .
we can wear anything .
thank you .
Friday : a pervasive truth -- a few words to you : gold <unk> .
and finally , a Saturday <unk> . it &apos;s a really nice way to tell the world who you are , and you don &apos;t have to say anything .
and it showed me over and over again , that when people come to me this week , it &apos;s just because I wear something . we have a great conversation .
and of course , the clothes didn &apos;t break me down .
so before I got back to Brooklyn , I was going to pull everything out .
because this week I was teaching myself to let go .
I don &apos;t need to <unk> things , because in the next corner , there will always be a crazy set of <unk> , <unk> <unk> in there waiting for me , as long as I &apos;m looking for love .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon .
I have something to show you .
think of this as a pixel , a fly pixels .
we &apos;re in the lab , and we call it <unk> .
let me introduce you to this .
now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Italian , every Italian boy in Italy has this picture of them growing up , but I &apos;ll show you why something interesting has happened in the last decades .
in the old days , if you want to have a budget in the <unk> , you just have a budget , and you &apos;re betting your budget on a good bet and a good car .
if your car is good enough enough , you &apos;re going to run away .
now , if you want to look at this , you actually need something else , like this one -- some of the devices that detect the vehicle in real time , connect with thousands of sensors that are collected in the form of data , sending them into the system , and processing them to respond to the feedback , and use that to actually change the information in synchrony .
and this is what engineers call real @-@ time surveillance systems .
basically , this system includes two components , one is a driver .
now , the interesting thing about this is that this real @-@ time surveillance system is beginning to stream into our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , have been covered by networks , electronic industry .
it became like a wireless and closed computer .
and also , as a wireless and closed computer , they begin to respond to different kinds of sensing and <unk> .
if we can optimize the city , it &apos;s actually a leap .
in my own opinion , I would like to say , cities are only two percent of the Earth &apos;s surface , but they &apos;re one percent of the world &apos;s population .
their energy consumption is 75 percent of the world &apos;s energy emission .
so if we optimize the city , it &apos;s going to be flying .
and on these cities , all of these sensing and <unk> are entering into our daily everyday objects .
this is an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
the theme is &quot; talking to me . &quot;
our environment , our environment , is beginning to give us feedback .
in a sense , like every atom is turning into sensors and <unk> .
and that fundamentally changed our relationship as humans and nature .
and in a way , that &apos;s the old dream .
you know , when Moses was like Moses , like Moses , at the end he got a <unk> , threw it into Moses -- and you see the little <unk> at the bottom -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; You speak for <unk> , why ? &quot;
today , for the first time , our environment started giving us feedback .
and I &apos;m going to show you just a few cases -- one time , the consciousness of our consciousness and responding to our environment .
let &apos;s start with sensing .
the first project I want to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab .
that was in Italy six months ago .
what we were doing there was actually using a new network of networks that were already covered in the world -- mobile phone networks -- and collecting detailed information from this network of information to understand how cities work .
it was a very lucky summer summer in 2006 .
this is the year the Italian World Cup <unk> .
some of you may remember that , in Italy , Italy was a great deal of French , and that was a great deal .
anyway , Italy won .
now let &apos;s see what happened that day , using the grid to actually demonstrate what happened in real time .
you see the city now .
you see the big <unk> theater in Rome , the <unk> .
this is the morning , before the match .
you &apos;re looking at the top of the timeline .
and at noon , the people over here were walking .
the game begins -- silence .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . Italy is a <unk> .
and everybody quickly ordered a phone , a toilet .
and the game ended .
the first one , the second one .
and when I got there , I got to the door .
Italy wins . ha . ha .
and that night , everybody went to the inner city and celebrated .
you can see rush hour .
the next day , everybody went to the inner city hall and the prime minister .
and then he died back .
you see this place called the <unk> <unk> , where people are going to celebrate -- there will be a great party at the end of the day .
this is just one example of how we now perceive this city in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
another quick example of perception is not about people this time , but about the things we use and consume .
today , we know where everything comes from .
this is a map showing you all the <unk> of a Mac , how to assemble .
but we know very little about where all of this money ends .
so this project , we actually developed some small tags to track the waste so it moves in the system .
in fact , we worked with volunteers who were willing to help us in Seattle , just a year ago , to get the things that people were throwing away -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that we just threw away anyway .
we took the little <unk> , the little tags , and we started tracking them on the garbage and we started tracking them .
this is what we observe .
from Seattle ...
a week later .
and from that information , we realized there &apos;s a lot of inefficient operating systems .
I actually do the same thing with less energy .
this data was not available .
but there &apos;s a lot of garbage and complex things happening .
there &apos;s another thing that we believe is that if we think about the cups we take away every day , it doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere around the Earth .
we still have to drop the plastic bottle every day .
and if we show this to people , then we can promote some changes in behavior .
so that &apos;s what this project meant .
I &apos;m at MIT &apos;s fellow , and Peter <unk> , he &apos;s going to tell you more about perception and a lot of the amazing things we can do with perception , but I want to start with the second section , which is actually about our environment .
the first project was about what we did in Spain a few years ago .
and it started with a question that was asked by the mayor of the mayor , and he found that Spain used in southern Europe to build , traditional water in a public area .
the question is : how can technology , new technologies , make it cool ?
one of the ideas came from an R &amp; amp ; D group from MIT is about , you know , imagine a pipe , you have a valves , you have a kidney chemistry , you have a low @-@ carbon , you have a low @-@ oxygen , you turn it off and off .
and you create a <unk> of water as pixels .
if the pixels leave , you can create these pixels on it , you can show <unk> , images , words .
and when you get close to it , it actually turns off to allow you to jump , as you can see here .
we showed this to the mayor of <unk> .
he likes it .
and then we got permission to build a building .
we call it the digital <unk> .
the entire building is made from water .
there are no doors or windows , but when you walk into it , it automatically makes you go .
the roofs are covered by water .
if there &apos;s a little bit of wind , if you want a little bit of water , you can actually cut the roofs down .
or maybe even close the building , it disappears , and it looks like this .
and these days , you &apos;re going to see this in winter , and when they lower the roof , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; They &apos;re <unk> the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t , but when it dropped , the building was almost lost .
this is what water does .
you can see how people get into trouble .
this is the sensor that I &apos;m trying to get myself out of the window .
and I should tell you what happened at night when all the sensors stopped working .
but it got more interesting that night .
and all the kids on the street are getting a little bit different because the way you get into the building .
the building will no longer open and let you enter , but the building will still be divided into different spaces , so you don &apos;t have to go to bed again .
and it &apos;s also interesting for us , because , as an architect , as an engineer , as a designer , we often think about how people use what we &apos;re designing .
but the reality is always unexpected .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing this .
this is a physical pixel , made out of water , and then made a projection on it .
and it reminds me of the next project I want to show you .
this is , imagine these pixels running .
imagine you would have a small helicopter that would move in the air , and each of them has a little pixel that can change color -- almost like a cloud that can move around in the air .
watch a video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one we just saw , and a couple of helicopters , synchronize , moving .
so you get this kind of cloud .
you get a flat screen , or you show it like this -- a two @-@ dimensional configuration .
or the usual , but the three @-@ dimensional changes are the bright spots , not the pixels .
you can use different approaches .
imagine your monitor could be used in different sizes or scales with different <unk> .
but everything is just a three @-@ dimensional pixel cloud , and you can zoom through it and see it in many , many ways .
this is down @-@ like grid @-@ like grid .
when you turn on the lights , you can actually see this as we looked at .
imagine if every one of those were controlled by the human .
you can get input from the individual pixels , from the human moving , and so on .
I showed you some of the first ones .
we &apos;re working with <unk> <unk> <unk> , one of the top <unk> of New York -- the New York Museum and the <unk> opera -- to capture his 3D movements in real time .
you can see the <unk> dancing .
you can get a different <unk> on the left .
these are all three @-@ dimensional scans and dynamics in real time .
so you can reproduce the whole thing .
you can jump like this .
but once you have these pixels , you can steer them with color and gravity and spin .
we wanted to use this as a sort of <unk> input .
I want to show you the last project we &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s something we did for the Olympic Olympics in London .
it &apos;s called the digital cloud .
and the idea came from , again , again , imagine that we could get involved in trying to change the environment -- which is to sponsor our digital cloud building -- like wind farms , but the digital cloud .
think about the money that you can give everyone a pixel .
and I think what has happened in the last few years is that we &apos;ve been through physical worlds to digital .
now electronics , knowledge , are everywhere in the Internet .
today , for the first time , the Obama campaign told us -- that we can go from digital self @-@ organized networks to the physical world .
and this is doable , and in this case , we want to design and create a logo .
it would mean some building in the city .
but in the future , it can be the challenges that are approaching today -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we can go from digital to the physical world .
so we can actually get people involved in this .
this is the cloud , and , using the pixels , the way clouds form in reality , the way clouds form clouds .
the particles are water , and the cloud of pixels are made of .
this is from London .
you can walk in and experience different experiences .
you can actually see at the bottom , the critical moment in 2012 , and actually use it as a bridge to connect society .
and the clouds in the sky are at the top , like the new peak of London .
you can come in .
this is a completely new digital <unk> at night -- but most importantly , create a kind of experience that any one of you can get to the peak .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
and through my artwork , I try to demonstrate that humans are not separate from nature , but everything is interconnected .
about 10 years ago , I went to Antarctica , and I first saw the iceberg .
I felt awe .
my heart is quick , <unk> , trying to figure out what this is in front of me .
the iceberg was almost 200 feet away from me , and I was just surprised that a snowflake covered in another patch of ice , year after year .
the iceberg formed when they broke the ice sheets or broke off the Ross Ice Shelf .
each iceberg has its own personal personality .
they interact with the environment around them in a slightly different way .
some of the iceberg refused to compromise , and some of the iceberg couldn &apos;t stand under any kind of passion .
and when you look at the iceberg , it &apos;s easy to think that they &apos;re all alone , they &apos;re separate , they &apos;re separate , they &apos;re more like we sometimes think about ourselves .
but the reality is much more than that .
as the iceberg melts , I breath out of its ancient odor .
and as the iceberg melts , it free up the minerals and it feeds everything .
and I started photographing these iceberg , and it seemed like I was photographing my ancestors , and I realized that there was no more of a given moment in time than that .
and when they melt , it &apos;s not about death ; it &apos;s not an end , it &apos;s a path to dying .
I photographed the iceberg , which was very young -- thousands of years .
some ice has over 100,000 years .
the final image I want to show you is a iceberg in Greenland .
it &apos;s a very rare opportunity where you can actually see a iceberg .
so here it is .
on the left you see a boat .
it &apos;s about 15 feet of a ship .
I want you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg , the shape of it on the surface .
and here you see it starting with a little boat , a little boat moving over the other side , a guy stands there .
this is an average of Greenland .
it came to the water , it was about 120 feet or 40 meters tall .
this is actual shot .
like this iceberg , they show you different aspects of their personality .
thank you .
and I had the privilege of getting involved in this amazing project in my life .
but the really cool stuff about this guy .
this guy &apos;s name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the first graffiti artists of the 1980s .
and one day he ran back to his house and he said , &quot; Dad , my legs were kind of <unk> . &quot;
this was the early symptoms of the spinal cord .
he &apos;s completely paralyzed .
only his eyes can act .
I had contact with him .
I had a company that was designing and animation , and apparently the graffiti was a complex part of the art world that we admire and respected in the art world .
so we decided to become Tony , the sponsor of the cause .
so I went to his brother and his father and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you some money .
what would you do ? &quot;
he said , &quot; I just want to be able to talk to Tony .
I just want to talk to him and he can communicate with me . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Wait a minute , I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking , &quot; not all the paralyzed people can communicate through these devices ?
and he said , &quot; No , no , unless it &apos;s a silent man , &quot; with an incredible <unk> , or not .
these devices are not so easy . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK , how do you communicate ? &quot;
have you ever seen the movie &quot; <unk> and &quot; butterfly ? &quot;
that &apos;s how they communicate -- moves their fingers .
and I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s too late . how ? &quot;
my wish was to open the check , and instead , I had a check that I had no idea how to <unk> .
and I promised his brother and his father -- &quot; OK , so let &apos;s talk to him , we &apos;ll give him a machine , and we &apos;ll figure out a way to do it again .
because one person &apos;s normal doesn &apos;t communicate , it &apos;s ridiculous . &quot;
a few months later , I had a speech at a conference .
I met these guys called the <unk> , the graffiti lab , and they had a technology that enabled them to take a beam of light on any surface , and then paint it with a laser @-@ painting , which would form a dark gap .
and they walk around and show art like this .
all of these things , they call it a life cycle .
start with the <unk> , then the <unk> , then the <unk> George Bush , and people see art .
but they always showed meaning a life @-@ cycle .
and I went back home , and I was having dinner with my wife for dinner with her , and she told her , &quot; Wait a second , if we knew that this technology would allow you to use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we take a laser to control a laser , and he would do graffiti again . &quot;
so we started doing it .
about two years later , a year later , after many organizations and many of us changed something .
one , we got the door of the insurance companies , and we really gave him a machine to communicate -- a Stephen Hawking &apos;s machine .
that &apos;s great .
he &apos;s the most fun person -- I call him a <unk> , because you talk to him , and he gives you a sense of , &quot; I &apos;m not . this guy &apos;s fine . &quot;
the other thing we did was , we gathered together programmers from all over the world -- literally , every corner of the world -- bringing them to us .
my wife and kids and I moved to the garage behind , the hacking , the programmers , the <unk> and the <unk> , took over our house .
a lot of our friends think that we &apos;re so stupid that when we come back to the wall , the picture comes down and the wall is covered .
but after two weeks , we did this for two weeks , and we went to Venice , and my child was involved , and my dog was involved , and we made this .
we call it the <unk> . you can look at this .
this is the low @-@ cost sunglasses , and we buy our roads in Venice , some <unk> and some things from <unk> and Radio Shack .
we take a <unk> camera , we take it apart , put it in an LED , and now this device is free -- we can make it free , we can download the source , you can download it for free .
and now we can do it completely without limit .
no insurance companies can say , &quot; No . &quot;
no hospital can say , &quot; No . &quot;
anyone who &apos;s paralyzed can now paint and interact with their eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much . that &apos;s great .
at the end of two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
I love this picture because this is somebody &apos;s room , and this is his room .
and all of these congestion are meant for this momentous occasion .
over a year &apos;s program , over two weeks of programming , fast food and night meetings , Tony started drawing in seven years .
this is an amazing image , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking at his life support system .
and we looked at his bed , and we let him see .
we formed a projector on the wall of his hospital .
he started painting again , in front of his family and friends -- you could imagine what it felt like in a parking lot .
and the interesting thing is , we also had to break down the parking lot , and we felt like we were part of the whole graffiti project .
and at the end of this session , he sent us an <unk> , which said , &quot; This is the first painting I could ever paint in seven years .
I felt like I &apos;d been running underwater , and I finally had a hand to put my foot in the water , so I could breathe . &quot;
that &apos;s great , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s kind of like our fight .
that &apos;s what keeps us moving .
we walked that long way .
it &apos;s a wonderful device , but it &apos;s different from the drawings .
one has more artistic potential .
we &apos;re still exploring how to make it better , faster , more powerful .
and since then , we have all kinds of acceptance .
we won a lot of rewards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us make money out of it .
all the costs are us .
and we rewards , &quot; Oh , this is great . &quot;
Karen Armstrong had written our Twitter , and then in December , the magazine gave us one of the top 50 inventions in 2010 , which is really cool .
and the cool thing is -- this is going to complete the whole loop -- in April of this year , in the city of Los Angeles , there will be a new type of art called &quot; street art . &quot;
and the street art there will be a lot of street <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- all of these people will come .
and it &apos;s going to happen in the <unk> , which is great .
so basically my point is , if you see something that &apos;s not impossible , make it possible .
all the things that happened in this room were impossible -- this stage , this computer , this <unk> , this <unk> -- were impossible .
this is everyone in this room making it possible .
I &apos;m not a programmer , and I never had anything to do with any eye movement that recognizes technology , but I just figured out something and connect myself to some amazing people that we can do something about it .
and I just wanted everybody to do it every day , and when you think about something you should do , you should ask your own questions . if I don &apos;t do it , when do I do it , who would do it ?
thank you .
as you know , my job is to write children &apos;s books , and in fact , I &apos;m probably the most popular children in America .
I often tell people that I don &apos;t want to be a scientist .
you can think of me as a farmer , a farmer , a farmer , a farmer .
I &apos;m here to tell you about recycling and <unk> .
and it &apos;s usually when you realize that you fall in certain circumstances .
you have to hit the wall and find an epiphany .
this is a picture of a cycle .
a friend of mine drew -- Richard Saul Wurman .
this is a complicated one , and I &apos;m going to tell you about it .
my cycle came from the 1960s when I was a <unk> high school .
I was one of those people who had been fed up with me every week until a teacher pulled me out of this life .
she pulled me out of this life and put me in the bathroom in my teacher &apos;s room .
and she did .
she did it for three years .
but I had to leave the town .
with expertise , and about 85 dollars , I finally graduated from <unk> , California - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
about three or four years ago , I got a call from that teacher , <unk> teacher , and she said , &quot; I need to see you .
I was so disappointed that we had never known each other as adults .
can you please come and find someone else ?
I should mention that I have cancer , but I want you to ignore that .
so the next day we went to Cleveland .
and we met her , and we talked , and we <unk> , and we knew that she needed to live in an old patient .
we found her , we took her back , took her back and took care of her family , because it was necessary .
some things we need to know how to do .
and that &apos;s the way I looked at the adult and thought about my girls , and eventually the powder came into my hands .
and what happened was that , at the end of the cycle , it formed a circle -- and the epiphany of what I said was self @-@ awareness .
and that epiphany was part of life .
she saved my life . I saved her life .
and that day , life needs to be done .
it needs truth and beauty , and I &apos;m happy that these days are mentioned .
it also needs -- it requires dignity , love and joy , and our job is to take these walks .
thank you .
and the idea behind the computer worms is actually quite simple .
we don &apos;t want Iran to have a nuclear weapons .
they &apos;re used to developing nuclear weapons @-@ grade facilities , which are highly scalable facilities .
the <unk> boxes you see are real @-@ time control .
if we manage to solve the speed and the valves in these machines , we can actually use a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
this <unk> box doesn &apos;t run Windows ; they &apos;re using completely different technologies .
but if we manage to take a Windows virus and put it into a device engineer , and then we can start acting .
that &apos;s a conspiracy behind the virus .
so I started with a Windows <unk> .
it carried the virus up to the <unk> boxes , the centrifuge , the <unk> programs -- the mission was done .
it &apos;s easy , right ?
and I want to tell you how we found this .
and when we started working on the virus about six months ago , we had no idea what it meant .
and the only thing that you know is that its Windows parts are complex and they &apos;re using multiple holes .
it seemed to have something to do with these <unk> boxes , these real @-@ time controls .
and this caught our attention , and we started a lab project , and we ran a system where we infected the virus , and we ran a very careful review .
and then something very interesting happened .
and the way the viruses behave is like the ones that don &apos;t like the <unk> -- smell <unk> , but don &apos;t want to eat .
I don &apos;t understand .
and after we experimented with various <unk> , I realized that this is a targeted attack .
it &apos;s completely targeted .
if you find a specific configuration , you can actually dive into a <unk> box , even if it &apos;s trying to get infected , it &apos;s doing the same thing .
if there &apos;s no target , there &apos;s nothing to do .
and that really resonated with me , and we started working on this , because I felt we didn &apos;t know what it meant .
the goal might be , for example , a nuclear power plant , or a German factory .
so we &apos;d better figure out where it &apos;s going .
we took and <unk> the code , and we realized that it had two digital bombs -- a smaller , smaller , bigger one .
and we also found that they were made by people who knew everything about it .
they know all the details about the attack .
they even knew the number of shoes that the operator had .
they know everything .
if you &apos;ve ever heard of this , the complexity of the virus , the high @-@ tech , let me tell you : it &apos;s very complex .
it &apos;s not something we &apos;ve ever seen .
and here you can see the footage of the actual attack .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 50,000 pieces of code .
it looks very old .
I want to tell you how we can figure out the code .
the first thing we &apos;re going to look for is the system <unk> , because we know what these functions are .
and then we had to find the <unk> and the <unk> , and then try to connect them to the real world -- linked to potential reality .
so we need to figure out whether or not we can use it .
and in order to get the idea , we remember that this would have had a severe disruption , and therefore there would be a high value proposition , and there could be many , many of them in Iran , because there are many of the biggest viruses in Iran .
there &apos;s not a lot of goals going on in this area .
you can basically narrow the target down to <unk> and <unk> plants .
so I said to my assistant , &quot; Give me a list of all the rich and plant experts in a centrifuge . &quot;
and I got a phone call with them , and I got them through their expertise , and we found it in code and data .
and it works pretty well .
and we can connect this little number with the controller .
this is a <unk> in a centrifuge inside a centrifuge , and that &apos;s the black object that you see there .
and if you control the speed of this tape , you can actually crack the pen and actually make it explode .
and we also saw the goal of the attack , which was to slow the pace of the activity -- obviously , to keep the engineers crazy , and they couldn &apos;t really figure out the problem very quickly .
the big numbers are <unk> -- by looking at data and looking at data , we have a chance to understand it .
for example , the number is very visible in these code ; it can &apos;t be ignored .
and I started looking at how the scientific literature related to the science literature around the world , and finding that they were organized in a thing called the level , and each level contains a centrifuge .
it &apos;s a little better . it matches up .
even better match .
and in Iran , these centrifuge are divided into 15 of these series .
guess what we found in the attack code ?
a close @-@ up of @-@ the @-@ group structure .
so again , it matches up perfectly .
this gave us more confidence in what we &apos;re doing .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , it &apos;s not like this .
and these results contain our weeks of hard work .
we &apos;re going to walk in and back to the starting point .
so in short , we &apos;ve identified these two goals from different perspectives .
and the little <unk> pick a scaling , and the speed goes up , and then they slow down , and then the big one picks up six levels , and then the valves control the valves .
in general , we were pretty confident that we knew what the goal was .
it &apos;s <unk> . it can be <unk> .
we don &apos;t worry about what other viruses might be attacking .
some of the really cool stuff that we saw -- and it really blew my mind .
here &apos;s the <unk> box , and there &apos;s a centrifuge up there .
and the thing is , it stops the input from the sensor -- for example , the input from pressure sensors and sensors from stress sensors -- and providing the legal code , which is still operating in the attack , the actual input of the code .
in fact , the number of input @-@ output data from the virus is <unk> .
and just like the <unk> footage from the Hollywood film , the camera was even recorded in advance .
cool , right ?
it &apos;s going to be clearly not just the operator in the control room .
it &apos;s actually more dangerous , more predator @-@ like .
it &apos;s going to be around the digital security system .
we need digital security systems where the operator can &apos;t do enough .
for example , in the power plant , when a tremendous amount of carbon flow <unk> , it has to open up a millisecond .
obviously , the human operator can &apos;t .
so , here you need the digital security system .
and when they &apos;re damaged , the real problems come out .
the power plant will explode .
the operator and the safety system doesn &apos;t notice .
it &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
what I &apos;m going to say is , very important .
think about this . this attack is universal .
it doesn &apos;t have to do specific things to uranium in a centrifuge .
it will work , for example , in a power plant or a car <unk> .
it &apos;s very common .
as an attacker , you don &apos;t need to -- you don &apos;t have to send the virus out , like we saw in the case of <unk> .
you can also do this with traditional worm techniques .
spread it as widely as possible .
and if you do that , then you end up with a massive network of weapons of mass destruction .
that &apos;s what we have to deal with .
unfortunately , the biggest goal of these attacks is not in the Middle East .
it &apos;s in the U.S. , Europe and Japan .
and all of these green areas , these are target density .
we had to face those consequences , and we &apos;d better start doing it .
thank you .
I have a question .
Ralph <unk> , who believed that <unk> was a <unk> .
what do you see ?
Ralph <unk> : okay , you really want to know ?
yeah , OK .
I don &apos;t think that <unk> has one of them , but not Israel .
and the first superpower that followed was the superpower .
only one , that &apos;s the United States -- fortune , fortune .
because otherwise , the problems we face are even more serious .
thank you very much . thank you , Ralph .
in the last few years , I &apos;ve put myself in tough and dangerous situations .
I went to prison -- tough .
I worked in a coal mines -- danger .
I was photographing in the war areas -- tough and dangerous .
I was eating this food in the last 30 days -- and it was fun to be in the middle , and in the middle , it was a little bit of tough , and at the end , it was pretty dangerous .
in fact , in most of my career , I &apos;ve been keeping myself in a situation where the purpose of my career is to find a way to study social problems in front of an audience .
so , when I learned that I was going to come here and do a TEDTalk about brands and funding , I realized I wanted to make a difference .
some of you may have heard about this a couple of weeks ago , and I ran an ad in <unk> .
there &apos;s a little bit of information about Facebook and Twitter that I have given people the chance to buy my TED Talk in 2011 .
yes , some lucky person or company will be able to buy the only opportunity in your life -- because I &apos;m sure Chris Anderson won &apos;t let the second -- the second one -- to buy the <unk> that you &apos;re looking at , and it &apos;s not quite sure that the title is not relevant .
so what you get is this : your <unk> are there : you don &apos;t know anything about my TED Talk , and it determines whether I &apos;m going to finally mess it up , if I give you shame companies , which is the possibility .
but then again , this is an amazing opportunity for advertising .
do you know how many people are watching TED ?
that &apos;s a lot .
by the way , this is just the headline of the speech .
and even though that made the announcement , I still believe some people would buy it .
if you were to ask me a year ago , I wouldn &apos;t look like this .
but in the new project that I was working on , which is my new film , we &apos;re going to have to think about marketing , and what the marketing is .
and as I said , in the last few years , I &apos;ve always put myself in a situation where I &apos;ve been in a situation where I &apos;ve come from , but the most dangerous experience I &apos;ve ever been , the most vulnerable experience I &apos;ve ever come from , is that I don &apos;t have any danger .
you see , I have a film like this .
Morgan <unk> : I wanted to take a film and put it in , marketing , ads , marketing and an ad campaign , and this is from an ad campaign .
the title of the film is going to be &quot; The <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
&quot; top @-@ down film &quot; and &quot; bottom @-@ up , &quot; is filled with brands from the top , and the bottom one is the brand .
the brand , the <unk> Center ...
the lives of these people are combined with the film <unk> -- always permanently .
and this was the following idea -- Michael Graves : what is it ?
I always say it again .
that &apos;s to emphasize .
it &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but not only do we sell each one of the brands , but we also sell every product in the video .
so , we sell one pair of shoes , and we &apos;re the oldest shoe ever devised .
&quot; the car in the history of the <unk> &quot; was the best <unk> in history , the most <unk> of all time , and then the film became &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Edith Widder : so in that sense , it &apos;s not just that the brand is part of people &apos;s lives , but it &apos;s raising the brand .
<unk> <unk> : in fact , we &apos;re going to show the process of marketing .
the film is about transparency .
and in the film , you &apos;re going to see the sequence of the brand marketing .
this was the whole movie , and it went through the movie .
I wish it would help .
Robert Friedman : what &apos;s interesting is that when you first hear this , I think it &apos;s the most noble homage to the audience .
but I don &apos;t know if people can .
Edith Widder : have you ever thought about this -- and I don &apos;t want to use that word , because it has a negative color -- what do you think is the result of that ?
DR : how much would this film take ?
one and a half million .
John Kamen : I think it &apos;s going to be very difficult to deal with these brands , but it &apos;s worth looking for these big brands .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : who knows , when your film comes out , we &apos;re probably a bunch of stupid <unk> .
FG : what do you think they &apos;re going to do ?
Stewart Brand : most of them refused .
Locke <unk> : the reason they refused was because I myself ?
John Kamen : anyone .
Locke <unk> : <unk> .
sir , can you help me ? I need help .
Michael <unk> : I can help you .
Beau Lotto : so .
that &apos;s great .
Michael <unk> : we have to lock the brand .
FG : exactly .
those of you who are going to work with ...
Michael <unk> : we have some people in the chain .
shut the camera off .
FG : I thought , &quot; Let &apos;s turn the camera off , &quot; suggesting it &apos;s private .
as a result , it says , &quot; We don &apos;t want to have anything to do with your film . &quot;
FG : so , these companies disappear .
no one wanted to help this film .
and I was shocked .
they were not interested in this .
and I was shocked , and I thought the idea of advertising , the idea of ad @-@ hoc , to put your product in front of as many people as possible , to see your product .
and in particular , in the world of today &apos;s media , shouldn &apos;t there be a new way of transporting information to people ?
no , it &apos;s just my personal idea .
the problem is , you &apos;re looking at my idea , there &apos;s a fatal mistake here .
in fact , it &apos;s not all wrong .
that &apos;s not the problem .
this is acceptable .
but this graph represents the problem .
you see , if you Google &quot; <unk> , &quot; this is one of the biggest pictures on the search results .
I like your mode , <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s the problem : transparency , transparency -- not transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , transparency , access to information , the ability to access business -- and the last one is probably the biggest problem .
you see , recently we hear transparency .
our politicians , our president and even our CEO are using this word .
and yet , when it comes to practice , it changes .
why ? transparency is <unk> -- it &apos;s like this bear is frozen , but it &apos;s a dead bear .
and it &apos;s kind of <unk> -- like this strange , strange little street in the country .
it looked like an <unk> .
so what else ?
you &apos;re eating a ice cream <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty bleak .
when I started talking to companies and told them we wanted to tell a story like this , they said , &quot; Oh , we want to tell you a story .
we want you to tell stories , we just want you to tell our stories . &quot;
and when I was a child , my father sometimes realized that I was looking at it -- he was looking at me all the time -- he said , &quot; Son , every story has three faces .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , there &apos;s a real story . &quot;
you see , we want to tell the truth through this movie .
and there &apos;s only one company that will help me -- because I &apos;ve been in <unk> with John James Bond and Richard <unk> -- and I realized that way is better than the fact that I &apos;ve got to skip the <unk> with my team directly <unk> with the companies .
and you suddenly start to realize that -- or when I started to realize -- you started talking to these companies about your own brand as a universal problem .
FG : I &apos;ve got two friends who were filmed in Hollywood , and I &apos;ve met friends like me who make small independent movies .
and my friends of the film in Hollywood told me they were successful because of their brand .
and my friends who make small , independent movies say , &quot; How can we do these Hollywood movies ? &quot;
and one of those movies is called &quot; The <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
so what are we going to see in this film ?
every time I walk out , every time I open my kitchen cabinet , you will see <unk> @-@ <unk> body fluids .
whenever I talk to someone , I say , &quot; Are you going to clean up today ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
let me give you a break .
maybe you can use some of that before we talk . &quot;
and we &apos;re <unk> these <unk> body fluids .
whether it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , there &apos;s always one right for you .
and we &apos;re going to do it for the men and women -- solid , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> body fluids .
that &apos;s what happens .
now I &apos;m going to answer any of your questions so that you can go further .
Frank Gehry : we &apos;re a pretty good designer .
and as you &apos;re talking about the cost of the little movies , we &apos;re a brand .
we don &apos;t look like other brands .
and the campaign -- you know , it &apos;s a place where people are interested in <unk> -- that &apos;s where we are .
Locke <unk> : what words would you use to describe the brand ?
how about that ?
Ze Frank : okay .
technology .
Locke <unk> : technology is not the best way to describe body fluids , which are products that people use in their arms .
we talked about audacious , <unk> .
I want to say &quot; <unk> &quot; is a positive result of a product , a flow of <unk> , to comfort . &quot;
it gives you a sense of <unk> .
how do you keep your body fresh , clean -- three times more clean .
all of this can be positive .
that &apos;s a small number of businesses .
what about me ? what about a man ?
and I had to ask people on the street , and they were like me , and they were <unk> .
they have to tell their brand .
<unk> <unk> : how would you describe your brand ?
my brand ?
I don &apos;t know .
I love being very good .
now , in the 1980s , the <unk> style is , unless it &apos;s <unk> today .
Lisa <unk> : okay , so what is the brand ?
FG : different .
I think it &apos;s my style that I think is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I love the dark gray things and things like that .
I usually wear a <unk> , like <unk> , and I like a <unk> .
if you had a brand , then it would be a classic <unk> shed , like the Mercedes <unk> .
two : my brand , I would call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
two women : a bit of hippie , a bit of suspended animation , a little <unk> for Brooklyn girls -- I don &apos;t know .
I love raising the pets .
my own national bank , even around the world .
and I think that &apos;s my brand .
and in this distorted little business , that &apos;s my brand .
my brand is FedEx . I &apos;m <unk> .
five : &quot; <unk> writers . &quot;
is this a real thing ?
lawyer : my brand is lawyers .
Tom : I am Tom .
Morgan <unk> : well , we can &apos;t all be Tom &apos;s , but I find myself the result of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
I realized that what I needed was an expert .
there &apos;s a person who can read what I think is a person who can really help me understand what brand is .
so I found a company in Pittsburgh called <unk> .
they &apos;ve helped <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , brand @-@ <unk> , discover their brand .
if they could help those brands , then they would certainly help me .
<unk> <unk> : do you bring the pictures right ?
FG : I took it . the first picture is my picture .
<unk> <unk> : tell me that this photo has something to do with you .
Locke <unk> : these people helped me define the world .
<unk> <unk> : what kind of world is it ?
<unk> <unk> : the world ? I think your world is the world of you -- everyone around you , your friends , your family , your lifestyle .
all of this has been a single @-@ <unk> place , and this is my home in West Virginia .
<unk> <unk> : what &apos;s next ?
FG : next . this is my favorite day .
<unk> <unk> : what does that relate to your perception ?
FG : it &apos;s somebody I want to be .
I love novelty .
I love weird things .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : &quot; why &quot; -- what does this help us ?
so what does that mean ? where do you come from ?
why is that important ? what is the red line ?
so let me explain that .
what doesn &apos;t match your style ?
what <unk> do you get ?
it &apos;s not necessarily fear . what kind of rollercoaster do you do ?
FG : uh !
Lakshmi <unk> : thank you for your patient .
FG : yeah .
well , I don &apos;t know what the end result is .
there &apos;s a lot of complex stuff .
<unk> <unk> : this idea has two separate personalities in your brand , each one of them -- on the other hand , Morgan <unk> -- that &apos;s a brand that has two or three ideas .
these two really good combine .
and these two together form a virtually <unk> .
I think some companies are more than one of their advantage , and they &apos;re not going to be both .
most companies tend to -- and this is <unk> -- avoid the kinds of fears they can &apos;t take , and then you &apos;re the opposite , and you actually turn it into a <unk> , which is great .
so what does a brand like ?
the first one is the classic , Apple .
and then there &apos;s also Target , the dome , and there &apos;s <unk> .
some brands are <unk> , some brands are deep inside , and they &apos;re not long , but a depth of ideas , a depth of ideas , a brand of power .
FG : a brand . what about your brand ?
what if somebody asked you to describe your own brand , your brand personality ?
are you annoyed ? do you want to make it happen ?
or are they lower brands ?
do you make a stronger brand , <unk> ?
the brand is more <unk> than the brand of brand @-@ new <unk> , adventure @-@ <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , magic and mysterious .
or are your brand lower ?
do you think like James Bond , you know ?
do you <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> like &quot; Oprah &quot; ?
do you deserve to be trusted , be safe , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , like the Dalai Lama or the <unk> ?
from this film , we found companies that were more than five or less low @-@ tech brands , and they said , &quot; No , they &apos;re not willing to have anything to do with this film .
they don &apos;t want to have anything to do with the film , because they don &apos;t have control , they don &apos;t have control .
but we ended up getting 17 companies who were willing to hand over and over again , who were willing to work with people like me , who had their ideas and their power completely gave us stories about the unseen stories that we didn &apos;t know -- the advertisers that have never been explored .
they tell us about the story of the neural network , and we introduced them in the movies about how they could use MRI to find areas of the brain that control the need in your brain , to get to the ad @-@ hoc movies .
we were not allowed to ban the <unk> São Paulo .
there &apos;s no billboard in the last five years , no poster , no poster , nothing .
we went to the school district , where all companies tried to put ads in the U.S.
what blew my mind was , let me get the most feedback or the ones that got the biggest benefit of what I did for myself .
and what do they do ?
they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , thought , &quot; Well , these <unk> may not take my benefits . &quot;
I &apos;m going to play with artists .
I &apos;m going to make a fascinating film with him , and it &apos;s going to make a difference in our view of the world .
what does that do to people ? is that successful ?
the film came out on the <unk> festival , and we looked at it .
according to the <unk> data , film has been published since January -- and this is not the entire movie -- we get about nine billion pages of the press .
the whole story got together for two and a half weeks .
and this is just what happens on the Web -- no <unk> , no television .
it wasn &apos;t even released .
there &apos;s not online .
and no other country has been shown .
and the film ended up getting a lot of attention .
for a film like this , this was a pretty good test , and we were looking for an ad agency , suggesting not to be involved .
and I still believe that if you dare to try and take risks , these risks become opportunities .
I believe that when you don &apos;t let people take risks , you &apos;re pushing them towards failure .
and I believe that when you educate your employees to not take risks , you &apos;re putting the benefits of the company in danger .
I think we need to make progress , we need to encourage people to take risks .
we have to encourage people not to be afraid of seemingly dangerous opportunities .
and finally , I think we have to face this fear .
you have to put that bear in the cage .
the fear is faced with risks .
a bite , a chance .
and finally , we have to embrace transparency .
now , a little bit more robust than ever before .
and I said , &quot; <unk> my whole talk through honesty through integrity and transparency , &quot; <unk> &quot; by my good friends at <unk> <unk> , they bought their speeches in <unk> .
<unk> : big data , big opportunities for global entrepreneurs .
<unk> give you transparency .
thank you very much .
Jean <unk> : so where are we going to have zero dollars for transparency ?
FG : that &apos;s a great question .
I have a check in my pocket that &apos;s a <unk> from TED &apos;s <unk> Foundation , and that &apos;s a <unk> check for TED next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I proposed to my boss to do something about art and museum , and I was here today .
it took 18 months .
and after a lot of fun conversations and stories , I could talk to you about nine countries , and I had 17 really interesting museum experiences .
but I want to focus on this .
I can tell a lot of stories about why we do this .
my personal story is very simple in the slides , and it &apos;s just how to get inside these pieces .
I grew up in India .
and I got a great education , and I didn &apos;t want to complain about , but I don &apos;t have a lot of opportunities for these museum and artwork .
so when I had the opportunity to travel around these museums , I started learning a lot .
when I was working at Google , I was able to participate in the technology that made it easier for people to come and visit .
so we formed a team , a wonderful team , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to get into the demo and tell you a few interesting stories about this project .
so it &apos;s simple . you go to <unk>
you see all these museums .
you see the museum , you see the New York Museum of Modern Art , the museum of the Netherlands , the museum of the Netherlands , the museum of the museum .
now let me go to one of my favorites , the New York Museum of Art .
there are two ways to go , very simple .
click , bang , you &apos;re in the museum .
wherever you are in Mumbai , Mexico .
you &apos;re walking around . you &apos;re enjoying it .
you want to follow a line in the museum .
and you click on it , and you dive in .
you go in , you want to walk to the corridor .
go on and play .
explore .
thank you . I haven &apos;t talked about the best part .
now I &apos;m faced with a painting of Peter <unk> .
and I saw this plus .
if the museum gave us imagery , you click on it .
this is one of the images .
here &apos;s all the metadata data .
if you &apos;re really interested in this artwork , you can click here , but now I &apos;m going to lock it up .
this is an image we took , and this is what we call the <unk> <unk> technology .
for example , this map , almost 100 million pixels .
a lot of people ask me , &quot; What do you get from 100 billion pixels ? &quot;
and I &apos;m going to show you what the 100 million pixels are .
you could contract a simple contracts .
you see something interesting .
I love this guy . he &apos;s got a dollar .
but you really want to go further .
so I looked around and I saw what happened here .
and I said , &quot; Wait a sec . &quot;
close to that , I started noticing what these kids are throwing .
and I looked at it , and I talked to a couple of people in the museum , and it turns out that this was a game called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which was a tough one on the side of a tough day .
and it was pretty popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did that , but I learned that .
and now it gets deeper , and you can see the front row .
now let me show you a little bit of perspective , and I &apos;m going to zoom out , and you can actually see it all .
this is our site , and this is the painting .
the best one is not yet , wait a minute .
now let &apos;s go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York .
my other favorite : &quot; <unk> . &quot;
let me give you an example of the details .
so what if you want to look at that ?
and if you want to see how the <unk> actually created this masterpiece .
you zoom in . you really zoom in .
and I got to my favorite bits , and I could really see the <unk> .
this is &quot; <unk> , &quot; and I thought , I never saw it .
I want to introduce you to another function I like .
there &apos;s a lot of stuff . I don &apos;t have time to go through it .
this is one of the really cool parts , the collection .
any of you , no matter whether you &apos;re rich or poor , whether you have a gorgeous house , no care .
you can go in and create your own online museum in these pieces .
it &apos;s simple . you go in and I create this force called the <unk> , and you can see it everywhere .
this is the <unk> of National Art Museum .
you can write <unk> , and then send friends a chance to really explore the way you like them .
so I want to conclude by saying that for me , the main thing is that these creatures are not from Google .
and I personally think it &apos;s not even a museum .
maybe I should not .
it really came from these artists .
and that &apos;s the way I feel it .
I mean , I want the digital media to be able to show their artwork properly .
and the biggest question I have today is , &quot; Did you do this as an experience for a museum ? &quot;
my answer was no .
it &apos;s a replacement experience .
and I said , thank you .
thank you .
this is a picture of the brain . your brain can split into two parts .
the left hemisphere is responsible for reason , and the right brain , primarily responsible .
if we measured the power of the brain , and tagged our brains .
for example , this means somebody &apos;s completely rational .
that means somebody &apos;s completely emotional .
so where do you put your brain online ?
some people might choose a very extreme situation , but I think most people in the audience , your brain should be more like this -- two brains simultaneously have very high potential .
they &apos;re not going to be <unk> or anything .
you can be rational and emotional .
and I thought that since I was a quantum physicist like most other quantum physicists , there was a great way of thinking about how complex ideas can come together .
but at the same time , we also need a good intuition to keep the experiments going .
so how do we raise that intuition ? well , we like to study things .
we study and fix it , and then we see how it responds , and then we improve our intuition .
you actually do the same thing .
some of the intuitions that you might have developed for many years , such as one thing only happens at the same time .
I mean , it &apos;s a strange thing to think about as something that can happen at the same time in two different places , but you &apos;re not born to this idea , you are nurture .
I remember seeing a child playing in a <unk> .
and he was just a walking and not very good at this child , and he fell .
but I bet and <unk> play gives him a very valuable lesson , which is that large objects don &apos;t let you cross , and they stay in a place .
this is a very conceptual model in the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
and that &apos;s a really bad model for the particle physicists , because they don &apos;t study the <unk> , they study those little particles .
when they looked at their particles , they thought they were doing all kinds of really strange things -- like they could penetrate the wall , or they could come up at the same time .
they were recording these findings , and they made a theory called quantum mechanics .
this is the cutting edge of physics a few years ago ; you need quantum mechanics to describe tiny , tiny particles .
but you don &apos;t need it to describe these gigantic , everyday objects around you .
and that doesn &apos;t really match my intuition , maybe because I don &apos;t study particles too often .
well , I still work on them sometimes , but they &apos;re not normal .
and I never saw them .
I mean , nobody can see the particles .
but that doesn &apos;t fit my logic .
because if everything was made up of particles , and each of those particles followed the quantum theory theory , then shouldn &apos;t the quantum theory ?
I couldn &apos;t find why it didn &apos;t follow .
so I know better about the whole thing , and if we look at it in some way , everything that tells us is that everything is rooted in quantum mechanics .
not too long ago , I started .
and I made this .
this is the first thing you can see , and it &apos;s the result of quantum mechanics .
here we see a computer chip .
in the middle , you can probably see the bridge .
that &apos;s the next metal I want to talk about .
this is a picture of it .
focus a little bit . we see that at the center .
and that &apos;s a close @-@ up , close @-@ up view of that .
what we &apos;re seeing here is a piece of metal , it looks like a diver , and it opens up one end .
and I made this metal in the same way as a computer chip .
I &apos;m working on a silicon chip , and I &apos;m <unk> around all these large machines for about 100 hours .
in the end , I had to make my own machine -- underneath the swimming pool .
this device has the ability to layer a quantum layer , but it needs some help to do it .
let me give you an example .
do you know how uncomfortable it is in a crowded elevator ?
I mean , when I was a person in the elevator , I could do all kinds of weird things , but when other people came in , I stopped doing this , because I didn &apos;t want to talk about other people , or , frankly , to other people .
so quantum mechanics suggests that non @-@ organisms change the same way .
the passenger pigeon doesn &apos;t just take a human , but it also contains its light in the wind and the heat of the space .
so if we want to see the properties of quantum mechanics , we have to wipe out all the other passengers .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
we turn off the lights , and then we drop it in a <unk> and we pull out all the air , and then we cool it down to above the surface .
now , in the elevator , the little <unk> can do anything she wants to do .
we measured it .
we found it in a very strange way .
it &apos;s vibrating , not completely static , and the way it vibrate is like this -- like a serial <unk> .
just to give it a little bit of impact , we can make it vibrate and we don &apos;t vibrate at the same time -- something that happens only at quantum mechanics .
what I &apos;m here to tell you is some pretty amazing things .
what does a thing vibrate and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
one example : all of the atoms that make up are still static , and these atoms are moving up and down .
they &apos;re only consistent with the specific time .
the rest of the time , they &apos;re <unk> .
that means every atom in two different places at the same time , and further suggests that the whole place is at two places .
and I think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
and what I &apos;ve been able to do over the years is to lock myself up on the wall , because , look at this one , the size of a single atom and the <unk> are about as bad as the <unk> of your individual .
so if a single person is in a different position , then the bow can be in different places , then why don &apos;t you ?
I mean , it &apos;s just my logic .
so think about what it would look like if you could be in multiple positions at the same time .
what &apos;s your cognitive problem with the <unk> fields of your own space ?
this is a part of the story .
and when we heat it up , and when we open the lights and see inside the box , we see that there &apos;s still one element .
so I had to create a new instinct , and it seemed that all the objects in the elevator were actually tucked in a tiny space .
you &apos;ve heard a lot about how quantum physics explains everything connected .
well , that &apos;s not exactly right .
it &apos;s a deeper , deeper than that .
and that &apos;s the connection , the way you connect to the neighborhoods around you , the real definition of who you are , and that &apos;s the profound and incredible .
thank you .
in 2007 , I felt that we needed to reinvent the concept of economic development in our consciousness .
our new goals should be determined when every single family thinks about where they &apos;re working and what they &apos;re doing , and they have at least five different places where they can choose to be competitive cities .
we have a long way to go .
there are billions of people in the developing world who don &apos;t have a city that will embrace them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that it uses more value than building value .
so we can easily create thousands of pieces of the world , or hundreds of miles .
you might think that sounds ridiculous if you &apos;ve never considered a <unk> .
but that &apos;s just the building blocks of the city .
imagine half of the people who wanted to live in an apartment were already in the house ; half of them weren &apos;t in .
you can ask for the kind of homes that have already been around .
but you know that the housing and the surrounding site is protected by legal and entertaining buildings .
it &apos;s a very difficult thing to do .
but you can build a new building in an area without development , like the beginning of a <unk> .
so I proposed that the government would set up enough places for the new city , including the Charter city .
and I know this at the same time that the <unk> and the <unk> are thinking about <unk> in Honduras .
it &apos;s said that about 12,000 immigrants from the United States every year and they want to ask them what they can do to keep them alive in Honduras .
and one time , <unk> said to the Tower , &quot; What if we were going to take our site out of place -- and if we gave it to the front of the embassy -- some of the American Embassy -- if we wanted to find jobs in Canada or the United States , they could find it in these islands or in the United States ? &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , there was a military coup .
in the next <unk> election , change and peace and peace talks won the overwhelming advantage of that .
and he invited the <unk> tower as his <unk> .
and at the same time , I was preparing a conference at TEDGlobal .
through a series of <unk> , a lot of users , tried to take the idea of the Charter for complex ideas and turn it into a fundamental essence .
the first one is that the significance of the law , as it says , is that you can &apos;t <unk> into the households .
we &apos;re focusing on new technologies , but new technologies need technology and demand implementation .
and in 2010 , a friend of Guatemala sent a TEDTalk about this .
he showed it to the <unk> .
they called me up .
say , &quot; Let &apos;s show this to our president . &quot;
we touched a conference in Miami in December of Miami in Miami .
I tried to explain what the value of these cities is and how much it costs .
I showed this slide to you the value of an area like New York where there &apos;s not an aid site . notice , in some cases , tens of thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it &apos;s a relatively abstract discussion where some of the <unk> said , &quot; Paul , maybe we can watch a TEDTalk . &quot;
and in a simple way , the Charter of the Charter is a city that begins with uninhabited , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and whether or not people choose to live in the next place .
and the president of Honduras asked me the question , who said , &quot; We need this project , &quot; which will lead to the path of our country .
and I was invited to visit <unk> on January Four , January 4th .
I &apos;ve shown you another example of this slide , and try to tell this , if you want to create a huge value in the city , it has to be huge .
this is a picture of <unk> , and this is the new airports in Denver have .
there are more than 100 square kilometers of this given .
I tried to convince the President of Honduras that if you &apos;re going to build a <unk> , you &apos;re going to start at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s bigger than 2,500 acres .
everybody &apos;s got a <unk> on the side .
the expression of the audience is serious and innocent .
and the President of the meeting said , &quot; <unk> , thank you very much , but maybe we can take a TEDTalk .
I have a laptop now . &quot;
so I sat down , and they had a TEDTalk .
it also captured the essence of the new city , and it brought people a new choice .
this is an option that you would go to a city , maybe in Honduras rather than the North .
it gave leadership a new choice .
because the leaders in Honduras need the help of the Charter for Compassion to help them set up and <unk> the Charter to convince everybody that the Charter will actually act .
and what the President <unk> has learned is that the ability to implement this , I believe , as a way to attract people to build cities , should be as important as the different parties of fear and doubt over the years .
we looked at that area .
this is a photograph there .
it can be <unk> for 1,000 square kilometers .
not long after , January 19 , they voted in Congress to provide a legal support for specific development .
in this case of the coup government , the parliament agree that it &apos;s more than one .
in society , all the parties have supported it .
as part of the Constitution , you actually have to go through Congress twice .
on January 17th , they passed the bill again in January 17 .
and immediately after the vote , the 21st of February 21 to 24 , about 30 people of veterans come to the two of the most interesting places in the world .
one was Korea .
this is a big , new downtown -- bigger than Boston .
all you see here for four years , but they &apos;ve been given permission to build .
another attractive construction sector is Singapore .
they actually built two <unk> in China and were ready to build the third .
if you think about it rationally , that &apos;s where we are .
they &apos;ve got an agreement , and they &apos;ve looked at it as the second city .
they &apos;re entering a legal program to allow the managers to come and have a more legal system .
a country has been willing to take the Supreme Court for the new justice system , and become the poster for the final appeal .
this is a city designer and an architect interested in it .
and it even gave them economic support .
but one of the early things that you know is that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of businesses intent going into the United States , and there &apos;s a lot of people who want to go there .
around the world , there are seven billion people who want to live forever to somewhere else .
a million people go from Latin America every year .
and a lot of it is the father who is looking for work -- sometimes single mothers who earn money to earn money for housing .
sadly , sometimes kids are trying to live their parents for a long time , sometimes for decades .
how is this a vision for a shelter in Honduras ?
or have you set up a couple of tens of thousands , or maybe hundreds of people around the world ?
and how does it take to maintain that each family has a number of competing cities ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends of mine in Honduras , thank you for TED .
hello . I &apos;m Kevin <unk> . I &apos;m a YouTube trend manager , and my profession is to watch YouTube .
it &apos;s real .
so today we &apos;re going to talk about why some of these videos are going to become even more important .
we all wanted to be stars -- celebrity , celebrity singers , comedian -- and it was very , very difficult to do when I was young .
but now the online video is making it real , so we can all be creative to do what we want to do , and then suddenly become part of the world .
any of you can be famous for the Internet on Saturday .
but over 48 hours of video every minute was uploaded to YouTube .
and in many , only one in many cases , there &apos;s a very small proportion that comes across and <unk> watch and becoming a culture of <unk> .
how does that happen ?
three keys : <unk> , community engagement and unexpected outcomes .
okay , let &apos;s see .
Mr. <unk> gas : Oh , my God . Oh my God . Oh my God .
Oh , my God !
ooh !
Oh , Whoa !
last year , Mr. <unk> gas ran this video of his <unk> park in his <unk> park .
in 2010 , the video was watched three million times .
this chart just shows this video in the presence of the <unk> .
but the bear didn &apos;t have to photograph what was happening in the video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that &apos;s what they call a &quot; <unk> , &quot; people do .
and he also upload a lot of video clips .
this video actually appeared on January last year .
so what happened ?
that &apos;s Jimmy <unk> .
Jimmy <unk> has a tweet about it .
because there are things like Jimmy Wales , and it &apos;s important for us to introduce new and interesting things to the viewer to get them to .
Rebecca <unk> : today &apos;s Friday , Friday . play is on Friday . every person looks forward to the weekend , Friday , Friday , Friday .
Rebecca <unk> <unk> : &quot; Friday &quot; is one of the Year &apos;s Day video .
this year almost 200 million views .
this chart shows the popular trend .
and the movie &quot; The <unk> &quot; with the bear , &quot; it felt like there was a red cross between nowhere .
what happened that day ?
Oh , that was the day , a Friday , really .
if you &apos;ve been wondering the peak , it &apos;s all on Friday .
but what happened on that day ?
it was chosen by <unk> it , and a lot of tribes <unk> the discussion .
the mystery theater of the Science , Michael Nelson , he <unk> his video on Twitter .
there &apos;s a focus or a group of people who are starting to see the videos and share their views , accelerating the video of the red .
and this group forms a shared joke and shared , not only to talk about it , but to talk about its own version .
so now there &apos;s a million @-@ dollar <unk> on YouTube .
and even on Monday , there &apos;s a different kind of funny behavior .
it &apos;s not like a one @-@ way entertainment media in the 20th century , and it &apos;s a collective engagement that allows us to become a part of a common phenomenon -- through spread or alone .
this one &quot; <unk> &quot; is a continuum of music .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
up to 50 million times this year .
and if you think that &apos;s incredible , you &apos;re much more difficult to imagine this video , and there are three @-@ hour versions that attract four million people to watch .
and there &apos;s even this video .
the cat is watching this other cat .
but the most important thing about this is this technology , the technology geeks , the Internet .
and it &apos;s been produced .
somebody made nostalgia .
and then I walked out of the street .
and the whole <unk> of the Red Sox made this thing like a joke that everybody could do .
because now we &apos;re not only in pleasure , we &apos;re still participating in it .
who knew this ?
who would know that rainbow or <unk> ?
what kind of play do you write in that ?
and within two days of watching the Internet , there &apos;s only unique and bizarre video that can capture .
one of my friends had a pretty good idea that a nice video was taken by a guy in New York City , and I had to admit that I had no interest in this .
Casey <unk> : I have a ticket because I don &apos;t have a bicycle on the bike lanes , but often because a lot of obstacles don &apos;t even get you on the bike lanes .
KB : in a way that was unexpected , the idea and the argument attracted 500 million people .
and it works for every aspect of our innovation .
so let &apos;s have a problem .
sir bear <unk> : what does that mean ?
Oh ...
Kevin : what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative participation groups , and <unk> , these are the characteristics of new media and new media networks that people can participate in and define what the audience is .
and as I do that , <unk> now comes Justin Bieber and a little bit of YouTube .
your ideas don &apos;t need to be generous .
we have autonomy in a popular culture .
and yet , this isn &apos;t the characteristics of the old media , nor is it the way media is today , but they &apos;re going to be the entertainment of the future media .
thank you .
10 minutes is enough to tell you about the three generations of women , the incredible power of this ties with the four @-@ year @-@ old girls and her grandmother tied together , five days , and a <unk> in the middle of the winter , and sitting in the middle of the night with the little girl who &apos;s been living in San Francisco today .
a constant story .
it &apos;s like a puzzle that &apos;s being <unk> .
let me tell you a little bit about that .
the first image in retrospect is a man who works as well .
he was a poet and playwright , and he was a nation @-@ state of affairs and freedom .
imagine him being a communist , and he &apos;s facing his whole life completely abandoned .
the ridicule of our friends .
he was quiet .
he &apos;s dead .
he was my grandfather .
I never understood his truth .
but our lives are richer than our memories .
my grandfather gave me his life .
and my responsibility was to keep him from being useless , and my responsibility was to learn from studying , and history tried to defeat us all the time .
and the next puzzle was the dawn of the morning , <unk> to the sea .
my mother , <unk> , 18 @-@ year @-@ olds , had two young girls .
for her , the only purpose of living is to flee families in Australia .
it was just impossible for her .
so , four years of <unk> novels , a long boat in the sea , a small boat in the sea , away from fishing .
big people know the dangers .
the biggest threat was pirates , rape and death .
and like all adults , my mom took a little bit of poison .
if we were cremated , my sister , my mother and the grandmother .
my first memory came from a boat -- the motors , the <unk> , the flow of waves .
I don &apos;t remember pirates come up a couple of times , but it &apos;s been shot by men on the boat , and the engine is flooded , and it &apos;s six hours away .
but I remember the trip of the oil drilling <unk> ; a man from the coast of Malaysia was killed , and the trip ended ; the first apple , a guy from <unk> .
no longer eat that delicious apple .
and after three months of the refugee camp , we were in Melbourne .
the next puzzle is a new life of women &apos;s three generations .
we settled in <unk> , a working @-@ class suburban , dominated by migrants .
and unlike the rest of suburbia , I forgot my existence , let alone the right .
the taste of shop as if it came from another world .
speaking of the same language , people are interacting with each other , and one thing is the same , and then it begins again .
and the mother started working in rural areas , and then went to the auto industry , six days a week , and <unk> .
and sometimes she would come and learn English and get the IT <unk> .
we are very poor .
save every single dollar . the rest of the money is used to <unk> the English language and mathematics , whether it &apos;s <unk> , even without new clothes , <unk> .
and I was wearing socks , and there was a hole in one hand .
the uniforms in schools cover the knee , because it has to stay for six years .
and although very little , the search @-@ for <unk> , the graffiti sometimes says , &quot; Asian people go home . &quot;
where do you go home ?
something <unk> my heart .
a force pulls in , a quiet sound is saying , &quot; I &apos;m going to transcendence you . &quot;
I , my sister and my mother slept in the same bed .
mothers bring their homes home every night , but what we do is we listen to one day , and we listen to the acoustic enclosure .
my mother had a nightmare that had a boat .
my job was to stay awake , wake her as a nightmare .
she opened a computer store , studied <unk> , and she went into the future .
there &apos;s no story about men , no transition , anger , boring , questions like two worlds .
find money and aid .
we built the center .
I live in a parallel world .
on the one hand , I &apos;m a typical Asian student .
on the other hand , I was suffering from the dangers of reality , the violence of violence , the drugs and the apartheid regime .
but it &apos;s been helpful for so many years .
when I was graduating from college graduates , I was selected to be the young Australian youth .
and I jumped from one of those clips to the other , and there was no beautiful connection .
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> , now refugees , social activists , invited to speak , to a place never heard of .
I don &apos;t know the agreement .
I don &apos;t know how to use <unk> .
you don &apos;t talk about wine .
it &apos;s not speaking .
and I wanted to go back to the past , the <unk> of suburbia -- the grandmother , the present and two daughters , over the last 20 years , talking about each other , and gradually sleep in bed .
I told my mom , I couldn &apos;t do it .
she reminded me that she took us a boat out of a cruise ship , and it was my age right now .
there &apos;s no choice .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; she said , &quot; to really do it . &quot;
and so I talked about unemployment and <unk> and education , ignored the edges of the group and <unk> politics .
the more honest I was talking about , the more I was asked .
people around the world , doing what they like , what they live .
and even though I completed my studies , I realized that I couldn &apos;t limit the law .
here &apos;s another puzzle clip .
at the same time , I realized that being an outsider could also , the latest thing , the news on the screen wasn &apos;t just possible , something came from a boat .
because it &apos;s too easy to abandon your vision , it &apos;s too easy to get your assumptions .
and I have to stand now in the comfort zone , and the world starts to break apart , not depending on what you &apos;re worried about .
you &apos;re not allowed to <unk> or encourage the possibility .
there &apos;s energy , pure optimism , mixed with the courage and the courage .
follow my hunch .
I gathered together a team that said , &quot; The only challenge we have . &quot;
for a year , we &apos;re not alone .
and at the end of the day , I do a whole bunch of people .
every night trying to work .
most of our ideas are crazy , and a few of them are smart , and we &apos;ve cracked .
I felt like moving to America .
after a trip .
my intuition ran over and over again .
after three months of arriving , I continued to take risks .
at the end , let me just say my grandmother .
she grew up in the middle of a massive epidemic , the largest <unk> .
life in centuries had never changed .
when she was born , her father died .
it was raised by the mother alone .
she married an old girl who was 17 years old and she had a <unk> , a <unk> .
there was no husband &apos;s support , taking her husband to the court , <unk> her , winning her , <unk> <unk> .
impossible is possible .
and when she died in Melbourne about 600 miles away , I was in a hotel in Sydney .
through the glass , I saw her standing across .
I knew she was .
my mom &apos;s phone rang a few minutes later .
and a few days later , we went to the <unk> , and we sat next to her coffin .
we tell the story , and we promise her we &apos;ve always been with her .
and the night <unk> told us that he had to cover the coffin .
my mom made us feel the grandmother &apos;s hand .
and she asked the question , &quot; Why is it that the grandmother &apos;s hand is Van <unk> ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been in bed since the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you never let go . &quot;
if we have mobility in our family , it must be women .
if we think about the way we shape ourselves and life , we now see that a man has to cut us down , and we have to cut us down .
failure is too easy .
now I want my child , my own boat .
who would not ?
and I was afraid of privilege , privilege and power .
washing machines for their lives , brave <unk> , every waves , naturally , <unk> engines , <unk> vision , no <unk> , can I do that ?
I don &apos;t know .
but I can let it go , look at their safety , and that &apos;s what I hope .
and at the same time , the scene from the present day , comes to the fourth , the fourth and the fourth .
today I want to share with you some of my photographs .
or is this a photographic work ?
because , of course , this is a photograph , but it &apos;s a photograph you didn &apos;t see .
however , my interest in photography started when I got the first digital cameras .
it was buried in my passion for painting , but there was a difference , because the actual process of using the camera is already ahead .
when you take a camera and you shoot at the end of the shoot .
so it seemed to me that photography was more about location and time .
I think anyone can do it .
so I wanted to do something special , and it was that when you beat the shoot at the end of the shoot .
this is a photo : a busy highway is being built .
but it didn &apos;t happen .
but nonetheless , it remains a sense of the <unk> .
or you have color in the image , and you have color , but it &apos;s all about trying to keep a sense of <unk> .
and what I &apos;m talking about is the probability of the image .
because it &apos;s not something you can actually hold , but I always wanted to make it look like a way to get caught .
these pictures need you to quickly figure out the skills behind them .
so what &apos;s more about this is capturing an idea instead of capturing a moment of reality .
but what does it take to make these pictures look realistic ?
is it about detail ? is it about color ?
is it about light ?
what caused this illusion ?
sometimes different perspectives can cause different hallucinations .
but ultimately , it &apos;s going to be because of how we understand the world and how we understand it in a two @-@ dimensional space .
it &apos;s not about what it is , it &apos;s about what we think looks like .
so I think these ingredients are actually simple .
and I think of it as a puzzle in the real world , where you can put different pieces of the real world together and create another reality .
let me give you a simple example .
there are three things that can be imagined and real , and we can find them in the real three @-@ dimensional world .
but if you combine these objects in a way , you can create a visual object that &apos;s still three @-@ dimensional , as if it &apos;s possible .
but at the same time , we know it &apos;s not possible .
and we &apos;re cheating our brains , because the brain &apos;s not there .
and that &apos;s how it works .
it &apos;s just a combination of different reality .
so what makes a photo look like is something that we normally don &apos;t even think , but we live in a daily life .
but when we combine that , it &apos;s worth remembering that otherwise it might be a bit freaky .
what I want to suggest is that we &apos;re going to follow three simple principles in order to achieve what that looks like .
you see , these images are not special .
but together they can create this .
so the first principle is that all of the photographs that are taken together show the same view .
secondly , the same amount of light that comes together .
both of these photographs fit the same height and the same light .
and the third principle is , it &apos;s hard to see the bridge , and it &apos;s going to make the bridge look <unk> .
and it &apos;s not just how this image works .
by matching the colors of the colors , the <unk> and the <unk> of the photo array , the depth of the depth and the noise of the eye , we can take away the boundary between the photo and make it look like a single photograph , even though it contains hundreds of photos .
here &apos;s another example .
some of you might think that this is just a piece beneath the surface of a coin .
but this photograph actually shows a lot of photographs taken from different places .
and I personally think that creating a place is easier than finding a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise with your own brain .
but this really needed a lot of planning .
and when this came to mind last winter , I knew that I had a couple of months to design this thing , and basically to find a picture of this puzzle .
this fish , for instance , was a <unk> .
it was taken from another location .
the depth of the water was a quarry .
and by the way , I put it in red , and it makes it look more wind .
and in order to do that , what I think is most important is plan .
it always comes up with the idea and the idea .
and that &apos;s a different picture .
each of these photographs is taken by the plan .
and if you can get a good photo , it &apos;s going to work beautifully , and it looks like that .
so all of the tools that we have in there are only constraints in our imagination .
thank you .
I want to talk to you about why some digital healthcare programs failed .
and one of the most important things I think is that we don &apos;t listen to patients .
one of the things we did at the University of Holland was appointed a <unk> listening officer .
not in a very scientific way -- she has a coffee or a cup of coffee , a family , relatives . &quot;
what needs us ? &quot;
and I think that &apos;s one of the main reasons why we failed to think that this is one of the main reasons why we don &apos;t listen .
this is a simple thing .
here &apos;s a switch .
every morning I weigh it .
<unk> , I set myself up a <unk> , as you can see .
and I set the weight up .
in fact , the whole operation was very simple , and it sent my data to Google Health .
and at the same time , my doctor , he could take a look at my weight and see what the problem was , not until he got a heart attack like a heart attack , but all the way around .
but here &apos;s another one .
some of you may know that I have a big fan on Twitter .
so every morning I weigh my weight , and before I get in the car , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you &apos;re lunch or Jane . &quot;
but that &apos;s a really good idea , because this is a stress provider &apos;s stress , and it &apos;s going to be able to help treat obesity , and it &apos;s going to help someone quit smoking .
but on the other hand , it can also bring people together in some kind of game @-@ like activities that are better for maintaining health .
and this next week , we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
there &apos;s a little <unk> that connects to the smartphone or other equipment .
and then people could measure their blood pressure and send it back to their doctor and give it back to another 100 dollars .
and that &apos;s the crux , when the patient is collecting the data , they &apos;re not just self @-@ controlled , they &apos;re able to handle the challenges that we have in our healthcare care , like Medicaid , or demand .
we have to get technology in order to get people to the track .
you can do this with technology .
today I &apos;m going to show you a project that we &apos;re doing .
we have mobile devices in our cars .
and even the mobile phone .
we know where the ATM machines are .
you know where the gas station is .
of course , there &apos;s fast food .
but where &apos;s the <unk> of the patient &apos;s lives ?
and we asked everywhere .
no one knows that the life @-@ saving lives are now found .
we sent this whole assignment to the Dutch people .
we built a website that told people , &quot; If you look at an individual <unk> , please mark it on the Internet , and it doesn &apos;t open up for 24 hours .
in the Netherlands , we have <unk> tagged .
the next step is to develop applications .
we developed an iPad .
an <unk> app , <unk> , looking for <unk> .
if you see someone in <unk> , you can actually use the iPhone in a couple of weeks , and Microsoft has found the latest treatment for saving lives .
what I want to talk to you about today is not just <unk> , it &apos;s the name of that product and the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to push this around the world .
and we &apos;re also calling for colleagues and universities around the world to come together to come up with us and <unk> around the world .
so when you go out and you see someone who has a family , maybe a family or a way , and you find a family .
and here we also want to call for companies around the world to be able to test these <unk> .
for instance , sending a <unk> or a <unk> to see if the flag was still there .
so please , in this case , help us not only get better health , but also get better .
thank you .
today , I &apos;m going to talk about some unexpected discoveries .
now I work at the solar cell .
and the little company that I just founded was trying to force us into a natural way of focusing on ...
and you can see that it can happen .
this little video clip shows what we &apos;re doing .
ah , wait a minute .
and it takes some time .
maybe we can skip -- I &apos;ll skip the video .
don &apos;t do it .
this is not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
wouldn &apos;t it be my time ?
all right , thank you very much .
a few years ago , I started a project where some of the great technologies and design people were working in a place where they were supposed to represent everything they wanted -- government @-@ to @-@ government projects a year .
this project is called &quot; The American Code , &quot; a little bit like <unk> .
we take a couple of people a year , and we make them work for governments .
not sending them to the third world , but bringing them to the city hall .
there , they created great apps , and they worked with the city companies .
but the real goal is to show the possibility that technology can create today .
this is Al .
Al is a fire hydrant in the inner city .
it looks like it &apos;s waiting for its date , but what it &apos;s really waiting for is a person that can break it down when it &apos;s lined up , because it knows that when it &apos;s been covered by four feet of snow , its ability to melt down .
how does it work in a particular way ?
last year we &quot; The United States Code &quot; has a team at <unk> .
they were in February at the time of February , and there were a lot of them last February .
they noticed that the fire hydrant in the city would be found .
and one of the people in that group , Erik <unk> -- there &apos;s another phenomenon : the citizens get rid of the ice in front of the fire hydrant .
so he did what any good programmer would do , and he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a lovely program for you to adopt a fire hydrant .
and then you agreed to dig it in the snow .
if you did that , you could give it a name ; he called this first Al .
but if you don &apos;t dig it , other people can steal it from you .
so it has some little bit of entertainment in it .
this is a relatively small program .
it may be the smallest act of paper that he wrote in that year .
but it did what any other government technology could not do .
it <unk> like a virus .
a IT department in Hawaii , a IT department at the University of Pennsylvania saw this process , and realized that it didn &apos;t necessarily have to be used to <unk> the snow , it could use it to get citizens to adopt the tsunami .
and the tsunami &apos;s function is important , but people tend to steal the batteries from them .
so he asked citizens to check them .
and then Seattle decided to use it to get citizens to clean up the sewer channels .
and Chicago started using it to get people out of the mountains .
we now know there are nine cities that are using it .
it just drops , organically , naturally , <unk> .
if you know something about government , you know , it &apos;s not common .
developing a software tends to take a few years .
last year we had a team of three and a half months and months of work .
it can help parents decide which public government is best for their children .
and then we were told that if this program was working properly , it would take at least two years , and it would take about two million dollars .
and this is just a small number .
California has a program that costs 20 billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are all kinds of projects in government .
so a program only takes a couple of days to program , and it &apos;s like viral <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> for government institutions .
it sees that government can become more efficient , but not more private companies , like a lot of people think .
it wasn &apos;t even like a tech company , but it was more like the Internet itself .
it doesn &apos;t mean you &apos;re going to be able to do it without permission .
and that &apos;s very important .
but what this program represents , more importantly , is that the next generation of people treat government as a problem for community action , not as an institution for change .
and that &apos;s a great message , because , as it turns out , we &apos;re very good at digital technologies .
there &apos;s a very large community now built to make us more efficient .
it &apos;s not just the people in the United States code , there are hundreds of people in the country writing code every day in their own communities and using it in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up government .
and even though they were disappointed , they weren &apos;t complaining , and they were trying to improve it .
these people know something we &apos;ve lost .
and that is that when you peel away all of our anger &apos;s shell , like we felt about politics , and we got a long line from the outside of the vehicle , the government , at the center of it , says , &quot; Well , the government can do something for us . &quot;
there are a lot of people who are totally <unk> about government .
if you &apos;re one of them , I want you to think about it , because a lot of things are changing .
politics don &apos;t change , but governments are changing .
and because of the power of the government , from the very fundamental source of energy , we see how it will affect its transformation .
when I started this project , I didn &apos;t know much about government .
like a lot of people , I think the government is just a selection staff of elected officials .
two years later , I got a message . government , particularly local governments , is about <unk> .
here &apos;s the phone center for service and information information information .
if you call the &quot; <unk> &quot; in your city , you &apos;re going to be connected .
if you &apos;re going to have a chance to work at the center of your city center , a colleague like our project did this -- in fact , they &apos;re all going to have to do this service -- you &apos;re going to notice that people have to call government counseling and counseling at home .
Scott got this call .
he put himself in the car , and he typed in the official <unk> .
nothing . he begins with the control center .
and at the end , he said , &quot; Well , you can open up all your door and open it up with a lot of music , and then watch if it &apos;s going to leave ? &quot;
and that worked . Scott , <unk> .
but it wasn &apos;t the end of the story .
and there &apos;s no waiting room number .
it has a program , a website and mobile mobile , called citizens <unk> .
we didn &apos;t write this program .
it &apos;s a group of brilliant people writing in a new urban structure .
there &apos;s a day when the release comes out -- this is a real report -- &quot; There &apos;s a trash bin in it . you can &apos;t see if it &apos;s dead .
how do I get it ? &quot;
citizens connected to this problem in different ways .
Scott &apos;s communication was human .
but it &apos;s all freely accessible in citizens , so everyone can see .
this time , a neighbor saw it .
and the next report we got was this : &quot; I passed through this place and found the trash behind the house .
have they ever seen it ? they &apos;re alive .
put the bin and put it back home .
get out of bed . &quot;
that &apos;s it .
so that &apos;s good . that &apos;s the reality and the digital world .
and that &apos;s a great example of how government plays an <unk> game .
but this is also a great example of what government does .
and I &apos;m not here to suggest the definition of a platform @-@ driven technology .
I just want to mention a platform where people can help each other .
a citizen helped another citizen , and the government plays an important role .
and it just kind of melted itself .
it can be used by government services to help people , but a neighbor is far more simple and affordable .
and when one of our neighbors helped another , our social connection is increasing .
we called the <unk> Center for <unk> , and we pay a lot of money .
one of the things that we need to think about is that the government is different from the politics .
a lot of people understand this , but they still believe that politics is the input of government .
our input from the government system is through the ballot .
so far , we &apos;ve chosen a lot of political leaders -- and sometimes we spend a lot of our energy trying to support a new political leader -- and then we expect government to do things that reflect our values and what we need , but not much change at all .
that &apos;s because governments are like a giant ocean , and politics is just one layer above the top .
and the bottom line is what we call <unk> .
and we talked about it this way .
but it &apos;s this tendency that has kept this thing that we have and paid for it to keep our wishes going , and that we are losing our own energy .
people seem to think that politics is sexy .
if we want this department to serve us , we have to make it sexy .
because the real government is there .
we have to participate in government systems .
and this is what the United States National Security Council does .
have you ever met these people ?
they were a filled with a lot of people who wrote a very detailed , 130 @-@ page report to the U.S. <unk> Council on the U.S. <unk> Act .
it &apos;s not about participation , it &apos;s about engagement .
now , for those of us who have given up government , it &apos;s time to ask ourselves what kind of world we want to leave us alone .
you have to realize that they have to face a huge challenge .
are we really sure that we can achieve what we want to accomplish before we do it ?
we can &apos;t have government . we need it to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is taking this as a function of what we call the government , and we can use it to enhance our citizens .
now the generation is growing up in the Web , and they know that doing one thing at the same time , it &apos;s hard to build systems .
the average age of our staff is 28 years old , so I , quite <unk> , almost older than most of them .
this generation has become used to the subject themselves .
they don &apos;t have to go through our generation and talk about who can speak of speech ; they all have free speech .
they can express their opinion through any channels , and they can do it .
so when they faced a flaw in government , they didn &apos;t care about their own voice .
they use their hands .
they &apos;re using their hands to write programs that make government work better .
and these programs allow us to optimize our own hands .
it could be a fire pack for a fire hydrant , or a trash <unk> .
and of course , a lot of people started digging up the fire hydrant .
but these programs are like a small number of dollars that can remind us that we &apos;re not just consumers , but we &apos;re also not just consumers to pay taxes , pay taxes to pay attention .
we &apos;re not just that , we &apos;re citizens .
before we improve government , we have to take responsibility as citizens .
so the question I leave you with is this : when we &apos;re confronted with a lot of big , important , and we need to work together to do something , we &apos;re just going to have a voice , or are we going to be a group of people who are going to be working together ?
thank you .
and because I often tell people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming , I think , are going to be with the people that are coming together , so let me suggest that my real thinking and trying to understand how this has come about , and it seems to be an amazing improvement in how this technology happens .
let me start with a very boring technology slide here .
and then you can start off with the slide .
this is just one randomly picked from my document .
what I want you to see is not the details of it , but the overall form of it .
this is a slide that we did on the <unk> <unk> set , with local power analysis .
and what &apos;s interesting is that a slide like so many of the slides that we &apos;re familiar with , is a semi @-@ log line .
and every layer here , which represents the size of performance .
on a semi @-@ log plot , it &apos;s fresh .
this is a little bit of a surprise .
that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to talk about .
open up the lights .
and I &apos;m going to make the highlights because I &apos;m going to use the ink .
why should we use a log curve to describe the technology curve ?
well , the answer is , if I use the regular curve , this is the year , this is the time , and this is a measurement of technology that I &apos;m prepared to draw , it &apos;s a little silly .
it &apos;s like this .
and there &apos;s no information .
now , if I work , for example , another technology , like transport , on a semi @-@ log plot , it looks like a <unk> line .
but if there was something like this .
if transportation advances have come as fast as the microprocessor , then I can live on a taxi and go to Tokyo in 30 seconds .
but it didn &apos;t grow so fast .
there &apos;s no self @-@ sustaining in technology , doubling every few years .
now what I want to ask you is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don &apos;t last forever .
things can &apos;t change as fast as possible .
two things happen .
or it turns into something like this : an S @-@ curves all the way , or something like this .
that &apos;s all possible .
now I &apos;m an optimist , so I think it &apos;s possible to turn into this .
and if that &apos;s true , it means that we are at the moment where we are .
we seem to be on that line , in the world &apos;s transition from the past to the future .
all I have to ask , I &apos;ve been asking myself , what is the future of the world ?
what would it look like to be a new age ?
because the change seemed to be very , very confusing people when we were in it .
when I was growing up , the future was like 2000 , people were discussing what would happen in 2000 .
now this meeting , people are talking about the future , and you can see that it &apos;s still in 2000 .
that &apos;s how far we can get .
in other words , the future of my life is declining .
and I think the reason is that we all feel what &apos;s happening .
the change is happening . we can see .
we know that for the next three and 50 years , there &apos;s nothing going on , because everything is going to be so different that no longer exists .
so I &apos;m going to talk about what that will be , what will happen to our experience .
and to do that , I have to introduce a whole bunch of things that are completely different from technology and computers .
because the only way I decided to understand this is to look back in time and time frame .
and the time I &apos;m going to look at the timeline of life on Earth .
and I think this picture makes sense if you look at it from billions of years .
so if you look back in about 25 billion years , the Earth is this big , barren rock with some chemicals .
if we look at how these chemicals combine , we start to figure out how they form .
and I think there &apos;s some theories about how life started from RNA , but I want to tell you a simple story about life , which is that , at that time , there &apos;s a very small amount of oil that has different chemistry .
some of the oil droplet contains special chemicals that cause them to converge and become larger .
and the oil droplet starts to diverge again .
the most primitive of all , in a way , cells , the little oil droplet .
but these oil prices are not real alive now , because each of them is a random chemical .
every single divide , every single time , is not an internal chemistry .
so each droplet has a little bit different .
in fact , the difference with oil prices is to make them more integrated , to grow larger , to divide more , to divide more .
so they &apos;re much longer , and they &apos;re much more expressive .
it &apos;s a bit like a simple chemical form of life , but the process gets interesting when the oil droplet has learned to do something about it .
we don &apos;t know how to record information in a completely rational way .
they learn to cover the structure of the cells into a special material called <unk> .
in other words , they came up with this sort of evolutionary way of writing their genetic information , so that they could be copied in this way .
and the surprise is that this type of record seemed to last 25 million years .
we actually , our genes form exactly the same code , the same way of recording .
in fact , any organism is written in exactly the same letters and code .
in fact , one of the only things that I did for the entertainment is that we could record this code .
I &apos;ve got a hundred @-@ dollar <unk> , and I &apos;m trying not to let the airports discover them .
but what I have in this code is that what I do is I take this code , and it has the criteria that we use to label it , and then I write my business card to an oxygen , and it goes 10 to 22 times .
so if somebody needs a million of my business card , I &apos;ve got enough money to give everyone in this room , even everyone around the world , right here .
if I &apos;m a proud person , I &apos;m going to put it into a room .
so what &apos;s next ?
it &apos;s a very interesting step to record oxygen .
it causes cells to form -- and it makes them happy billions of years .
but there &apos;s another really interesting component that begins to become completely different , and that is that these cells start exchanging and communicating information to the cell groups .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , and the bacteria can actually exchange oxygen .
and that &apos;s why , for example , the evolution of bacterial immune .
some bacteria know how to get away from penicillin , and then it creates this oxygen that goes away and is in other bacteria , and we now have a lot of bacterial immune to penicillin , because the bacteria communicate information .
so these communication communities form , in a sense , they &apos;re in the same boat ; they &apos;re collaborative .
so they survive or die together , which means that if a community is successful , all the individuals in the community can replicate more , evolution has far better .
and so the transition was <unk> , and when these groups were very close to each other , in fact , they came together and decided to write the essential role of the entire population in a non @-@ <unk> .
the next interesting stage in life is over billions of years .
in this period , there are many cells , and there are many different types of cells , as organisms that work together .
in fact , we are the cells .
we have a lot of cells , and they &apos;re no longer just surviving themselves .
the skin doesn &apos;t work . if you don &apos;t have a heart cell , the muscle cells , the brain cells , etc .
so these groups started to evolve , and what &apos;s interesting about evolution is no longer just single cells , but we call them organisms .
and that &apos;s what happens in these communities .
these cells , once again , start to extract information .
they &apos;re starting to build very specific structures about the population .
these are nerves structures .
so neurons are the kind of information processing equipment that these cells have .
in fact , there are experts in the communities and the specific structures that are responsible for understanding and learning .
that &apos;s the brain and the nervous system of these cells .
and this gives them the evolution of their evolution .
because then , for each individual -- learning can happen within a single organism , not a whole time .
so an organism can , for example , learn to eat some kind of fruit , because it &apos;s not a good thing and it &apos;s disgusting .
this could happen in a single organism , and then , in that particular information processing structure , it had to evolve tens of thousands of years to learn by eating the individuals that eat this fruit .
so the nervous system , the fact that organisms form this particular structure , has dramatically accelerated evolution .
because that &apos;s where evolution can happen in the individuals .
it can happen within the long period of learning .
but what happened next was that every single individual discovered , of course , the secret of communication .
the most sophisticated version we know , for example , is human language .
think about it , this is an amazing invention .
I had a complicated , chaotic , chaotic thought .
and I &apos;m sitting here , basically <unk> sound , hoping to create a kind of chaotic chaos in your mind .
but we &apos;re turning complex things into sound , string of sound , and creating complex things in your brain .
so now that &apos;s driving us to behave as a single organism .
so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is that we , humans , start blocking .
we &apos;re at the same stage as multi @-@ cellular organisms -- taking our records , showing the way we process information .
for example , the invention of language is a very small step .
phone , computers , <unk> , <unk> , etc . , are the special mechanisms that we &apos;re building in our society for dealing with information .
all of this is connecting us , changing faster and faster than we were before .
so , there &apos;s now a subtle time scale .
you &apos;ve seen that little example of evolution that &apos;s sort of evolved to show a little bit of evolution right here .
so now we &apos;re going to accelerate time .
the first step of the story that I &apos;ve been talking about for billions of years .
next , like the nervous system and the brain , it takes millions of years .
and then again , like language and so forth , you don &apos;t have to be a million years .
the next step , like the electronics , as long as decades .
and the process is self @-@ sufficient , and it &apos;s become , I guess , the self @-@ portrait is a better one -- when things get faster .
the more the change the change , the faster it is .
and I think that &apos;s what we see here .
we see the process giving back to ourselves .
my job now is to design computers , and I know that the mechanisms for designing computers don &apos;t exist , and they &apos;re not going to be available .
now , what I &apos;ve done is designing complex objects that can &apos;t be designed from conventional design .
I don &apos;t know the role of <unk> on the machine .
there are billions of dollars .
in fact , the designers that I &apos;ve been working on , the designers of the machines , we think of as a kind of information , and then passing it to the machine , and using it to go beyond what we can do , and we &apos;re doing far more quickly .
and in fact , sometimes it &apos;s used methods that we don &apos;t understand very well .
and one of the interesting things that I &apos;ve been using recently is evolution itself .
what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re putting in a process of evolution in the machines , and it &apos;s going to happen in a subtle amount of time .
for example , most extreme situations , we can actually start a program with random instructions .
say , &quot; computer , please create a billion randomly instructions .
now if you run all of these random instructions , run all of these programs and pick them up the closest I want . &quot;
in other words , I define what I want .
suppose I need categories , and this is a simple example of what I &apos;ve experimented with .
find the most close @-@ knit program .
and of course , the random instructions are very impossible to separate data , so they don &apos;t have one .
but there &apos;s one in the middle , and it &apos;s good to have a couple of numbers .
and I said , &quot; Well , please , please pick up 10 percent of the sequence .
save all of that . abandoned .
now to replicate all of this stuff .
and then , again , <unk> process to replicate them .
take two programs and exchange them for their children , and these kids inherit the characteristics of two programs .
so I got a new generation of programmers that are doing better than one .
say , &quot; Please repeat this process . &quot;
do it again .
maybe introduce some mutations .
let &apos;s try it again in a new generation .
each of these generations requires a few milliseconds .
so I &apos;ve been able to do this on a computer for a couple of minutes as a result of the evolution of millions of years , or as complex as a matter of hours .
at the end of the day , I had programs that were absolute <unk> .
in fact , these programs are much more efficient than any other piece of software that I have .
now , if I read these programs , I don &apos;t really know how they work .
I &apos;ve tried to read and explain how they work .
they &apos;re abstract , strange .
but they can do the task .
in fact , I know that I &apos;m confident that they can do the task , because they come from a line where tens of millions of programmers can actually figure out .
in fact , they &apos;re living on this .
I once sat with <unk> <unk> , and he pulled out a single card , and said , &quot; Look , look at this .
and it says , &quot; Ben , there &apos;s a lot of very sophisticated parts working to keep you safe . &quot; is it going to make you confident ? &quot;
in fact , we know that engineering complexity doesn &apos;t really work very well .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers to do a very different process .
it allows us to produce more complex things than normal projects .
yet , we don &apos;t yet understand its choices .
in a sense , computers are way ahead of us .
and we &apos;re using this now to create faster computers so that we can run this process faster .
so it &apos;s self @-@ feedback .
and it became even faster , and that &apos;s why I felt that the computer seemed to be pretty annoying .
all of these technologies give back to themselves .
we &apos;re taking off .
and we &apos;re just at one point in time , which is kind of like a single cell organism that &apos;s turning into multi @-@ cell organisms .
we &apos;re kind of like amoeba <unk> . we have confusion about what we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re at the tipping point .
but I think there must be something that goes with us .
I think it &apos;s a very worship of us , and it &apos;s the ultimate invention of evolution .
and I think all of us are part of a <unk> , whatever next .
and as soon as I come , I &apos;m not picked , I think I &apos;ll end right here .
it &apos;s an honor to be here .
I spent most of the time in prison , in prison , on death row .
most of the time , I work in low @-@ income communities , and I work in areas of desperation , and I do projects that go awry .
and I &apos;ve been to TED today to see these fascinating talks that I &apos;ve given to you .
and in the short period of time , I noticed that TED has its own place .
and you can see what &apos;s happening here .
sometimes when things happen at TED , there &apos;s a lot more to it than there are .
and I came up with this because I felt that my identity was important .
we &apos;ve already heard some fabulous talks .
we &apos;ve learned that as a teacher , you &apos;ve got influence , and if you &apos;re a very charitable teacher , you &apos;re very keen .
you can help as a doctor , if you &apos;re a physician and a patient , you can help .
so I want to talk about the importance of spot .
I don &apos;t learn from being a lawyer or doing other kinds of projects .
I actually learned it from my grandmother .
my family was a traditional black family , and there was only one <unk> , my grandmother .
she was tough . she was tough .
she has a fight , and she has an opinion .
but a lot of things happened to her .
her parents were the ones that were truly <unk> .
in the 1960s , in the &apos; 40s , her parents were <unk> .
my grandmother was born in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 80s and her parents had decided to see the world .
my grandmother was very strong , but she was also very strong .
when I was a boy , every time I saw her embracing me .
she had that tight hold , and I would come back and she would let me go .
and one or two hours later , when I was bye , she would come and ask me , &quot; Can I feel my hug ? &quot;
and if I said , &quot; No , &quot; she went back to me , and she said , &quot; <unk> me . &quot;
she &apos;s the ability to get close to her .
the only challenge was she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of 10 .
and often when I go to the grandmother @-@ to @-@ grandmother , it &apos;s very difficult for her to see me , there &apos;s time .
my family was always everywhere .
and I remember , one of the things that happened to me when I was in the morning , I woke up , and I was running into the living room , and all the peoples were there .
my grandmother was sitting on the other side of the room looking at me .
at first I thought we were playing games .
and I went back , and I smiled her , but my grandmother was serious .
about 15 or so later , she stood up and she walked across the room and she said to me , &quot; Come , Brian , we have to talk about . &quot;
it &apos;s like what happened yesterday .
I &apos;ll never stop .
and she took me to the side and she said , &quot; I want to say something to you , you don &apos;t want to tell anybody . &quot;
and I said , &quot; Yes , my grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; promise no . &quot; and I said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we sat down , and she looked at me and said , &quot; I want you to know that I &apos;ve been watching you for a while . &quot;
and she said , &quot; You &apos;re a special child . &quot;
and she said , &quot; I &apos;m sure you can do anything . &quot;
I &apos;ll never forget that .
and she said , &quot; I want you to guarantee three things . &quot;
and I said , &quot; OK grandmother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; One , I want you to make sure you &apos;ll never love your mother . &quot;
she said , &quot; You &apos;re my mom , you &apos;ve got to make sure you &apos;re going to love her forever . &quot;
I love my mom . I said , &quot; OK , my grandmother , I will . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; The second thing is that you have to agree that you &apos;re going to walk forever , even if it &apos;s hard to walk . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; OK , my grandmother . &quot;
and she said , &quot; The third thing , I want you to keep drinking . &quot;
I was nine years old , and I said , &quot; OK , grandmother , I promise . &quot;
I grew up in the countryside in the south , and I had a brother , and I had a one @-@ year @-@ old sister and I was a one @-@ year @-@ old .
and one day my brother took me back to the <unk> beer -- and I didn &apos;t know how to do it -- he took me and my sister and he ran into the woods .
and he went crazy .
he drank a beer and handed my sister , and she drank my sister and they handed me .
and I said , &quot; I don &apos;t want it . you drink it . I don &apos;t drink . &quot;
and my brother said , &quot; Oh yeah , we &apos;re drinking it today , and we &apos;re drinking it a lot .
I drank a little bit , and my sister drank a little bit , and you were crying . &quot;
and I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t want to drink . you drink it . &quot;
my brother <unk> me .
ask , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? drink a little bit . &quot;
and then he looked at me for a moment , and he said , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re not going to think about grandmother . &quot;
and I said , &quot; What are you talking about ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; <unk> and every <unk> said he was special . &quot;
I &apos;m sad .
now I want to make a confession to make .
maybe it should be here .
because the talk is everywhere .
I took a break this year , and I will admit to you that I never had a drop of wine .
and this is not just to show you how ethical it is for self @-@ awareness .
and when we decided to have the right spot , we would have the world accepted things .
we can make the world do what they couldn &apos;t do .
and when I came to my grandmother , she certainly thought that every single dog was special .
my grandfather was banned from prison .
I wasn &apos;t just a uncle who was dying and drunk .
all of these principles were my grandmother &apos;s belief that we should persist .
what I want to talk to you about is our criminal law system .
and it changed a lot in 40 years .
in 1972 , there are only 300,000 people in prison .
today , there &apos;s <unk> .
today the United States is the highest proportion of people in the world .
we have seven million people , seven and a half million people , in a period of time and age .
and it seems to me that these kinds of lawsuits are completely transformed our world .
in poor communities , in color communities , despair , and despair is transformed by these changes .
a third of all black men and women are between 18 and 30 percent of the population are not in jail or in prison .
in urban communities all over the country -- Los Angeles , Oklahoma City , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of young people who are not in jail or in prison .
our judicial system , not only changed , but <unk> around race , has <unk> around poverty .
the justice system in this country will respond to you if you &apos;re a convicted person , and not an innocent person .
wealth , not <unk> , determines the end result .
and yet , we &apos;re pretty comfortable with that .
play with fear and anger , the wrist <unk> convinced us .
there &apos;s nothing left .
and I was fascinated by this .
and we see something very interesting about our everyday work .
and I &apos;m in Alabama , like many other states , that if you &apos;re sentenced to a life @-@ free political authority .
now , four percent of black men in Alabama are never allowed to vote .
we &apos;re going to look at 10 years from now , and this is going to take away from political rights , and this is going to be as high as the vote itself .
but nobody says half the word .
I represent children .
many of my <unk> were young .
the United States is the only country in the world that will survive 13 years .
the life @-@ saving imprisonment for children , for the rest of my life , was never allowed .
we &apos;re actually just helping these people appeal .
there &apos;s a world .
I also had a case of death row .
death penalty was sobering .
we learn from all sorts of things , and the fundamental problem is that people are trying to make their own crimes .
that &apos;s a perfectly reasonable question .
but the problem is our self @-@ orientation .
the other way to think about the problem is not that people are either guilty of crimes , but that we are <unk> them .
I mean , it &apos;s pretty shocking .
death penalty in the United States is something that always happens .
and one of the nine people who were convicted of death row was a death sentence later .
this type of <unk> -- one in nine people are innocent .
and I have to say , it &apos;s pretty shocking .
and the people who learned that , if there &apos;s an accident in the airplane , we would certainly not let this guy fly .
but somehow we can ignore the death penalty problem .
because that &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our own problems .
it &apos;s not our own struggle .
I talked a lot about it .
race , and we don &apos;t deserve to be executed .
it &apos;s alarming . when I teach African history , I talk to students about slavery .
and they talked to them about terrorism , which is the beginning of the great rehabilitation of time in World War II .
we don &apos;t really understand that history .
but for the black people in this country , that &apos;s a terrible time .
and in many neighborhoods , people were scared of <unk> and <unk> .
people worry about being attacked by bombs .
that moment , that changed their life .
and people were up there now , and they said to me , &quot; Mr. <unk> , you &apos;ve got to tell you , let alone 9 / 11 is the first time we &apos;ve ever dealt with terrorism . &quot;
they let me say , &quot; We are born in horror . &quot;
and that moment of terrorism , of course , became the ultimate <unk> , for decades of racism and apartheid .
and yet , our country doesn &apos;t like to talk about existence .
we don &apos;t like to talk about history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what we &apos;ve done .
we are constantly creating conflict .
we keep making intense atmosphere .
we can &apos;t talk about race , I believe , because we don &apos;t want to face a series of facts , we don &apos;t want to settle .
in South Africa , people know that we can &apos;t forget about apartheid unless we &apos;re honest with it .
in Rwanda , even after the genocide , people have faced it , but we don &apos;t want to .
I also talked about the death penalty problem in Germany .
and it was extraordinary , because there &apos;s an academic standing up and saying , &quot; You know , it &apos;s dreadful . &quot;
she said , &quot; We don &apos;t have death penalty in Germany .
of course , our Germany could never have death . &quot;
and the woman said , &quot; Because of our history , we would never expect to be systematically killing .
<unk> and <unk> execution , <unk> death , <unk> for us , <unk> .
and I thought about that .
what would I feel if I &apos;d been looking at the German slaughter from all day to day ?
I couldn &apos;t believe .
it wasn &apos;t enough .
but in our country , in the South states , we &apos;re really killing -- when the victim is white , not black , and when the death penalty is 10 times as likely to be executed , when only black men are sued , not the chance of being killed by white men -- during those states , the death rates are killed , and those are killed .
and yet , we don &apos;t pay attention .
I believe that we have a camp crisis .
and when we have a problem with these intractable problems , we still have a good problem for those positive things .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love to create .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , all of these good things are suffering from suffering , suffering , <unk> human rights , <unk> and <unk> .
for me , it &apos;s necessary for both of them .
because ultimately , what we &apos;re talking about is how we want to be more secure and more contribute to the challenges of life in this complex society .
for me , that takes time to think about and talk about the income of the poor , the vulnerable , the ones that never came to TED .
but they &apos;re actually sort of <unk> them into our lives .
you know , ultimately , we have to believe things that don &apos;t see .
we have to . we have to be smart , smart society .
innovation , building development , not just in our mind .
these are the products of our mind and our mind .
in each person , I believe , will inspire us , not just for the light , but for the sake of the dark and intractable things .
<unk> <unk> , the brilliant leaders of <unk> , talked about it .
he said , &quot; When we solve problems in Eastern Europe , we want to do a lot of things , but most importantly , we want a chance to have a tendency towards a soul and a willingness to feel despair . &quot;
and the point of the mind is that our core beliefs about our TED society are also involved .
there &apos;s no need for technologies and perfect design and our humanity as long as we can yet see suffering , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and I want to remind you that this is a very challenging position than people who don &apos;t pay attention to .
it affects you .
when I was a young lawyer , I was lucky to see the lady .
Mrs. Alisch would go every once , and every time she would meet two good friends , <unk> <unk> , Carl Sagan , who was a bus driver of the bus ride -- very brilliant black woman - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - and a white woman named Martin Luther King .
these women get together and talk about issues .
and sometimes her lady called me up and he asked me , &quot; Miss <unk> come back , we &apos;re going to be back .
would you like to hear us ? &quot;
and I would say , &quot; Yes , ladies , I would . &quot;
and she said , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
and I would say , &quot; I want to hear that . &quot;
and then I used to listen .
these parties were always thrilled and inspiring .
and one time I was listening to their conversation , and the lady asked me a few hours later , she said , &quot; Brian , tell me about your equality initiative .
tell me what you &apos;re going to do . &quot;
and I started <unk> .
and I said , &quot; We want to challenge injustice .
we wanted to help people who were convicted of <unk> .
we want to fight against prejudice and discrimination in institutional institutions .
the institutions for children who were convicted of the rest of their life , were <unk> .
we want to change the death penalty system .
we want to reduce the population .
we also want to keep falling apart . &quot;
I gave a <unk> <unk> , and when I finished , she looked at me and she said , &quot; Stop . &quot;
and she said , &quot; These things make you tired , <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
and the <unk> came along , and she put her hands on me and she said , &quot; This is why you &apos;re brave . &quot;
and I &apos;m sure the TED community needs some more courage .
we need to find our way to confront these challenges , these suffering .
because ultimately , our whole humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
in my work .
and I learned something very simple .
and I began to understand that each of us would not be defined by our worst side .
I believe , for everyone on this planet .
if he lied about a lie , he was a liar .
if he doesn &apos;t belong to what he belongs to , he doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s a <unk> .
and even if you &apos;ve killed you , it doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;re a killer .
because I believe that human beings have a fundamental dignity law that has to respect it .
I also believe that in many of our countries , there are , of course , even the opposite of the poorest of the world , not the rich .
I don &apos;t believe this .
I think the opposite of poverty in many , many places .
and in the end , I believe that although it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s tempting to make a difference , but we don &apos;t ultimately get shot by technology , we don &apos;t get paid attention to wisdom and philosophy .
in the end , people will rate that our society is not based on how we respond to the rich , the privileged people , but on how we treat the poor people , the ones that are being trapped .
because that &apos;s where we started to really understand who we were .
I always wanted to get there . I want to end with a story .
I work a lot .
it &apos;s like everybody .
sometimes these ideas are too large , and they don &apos;t get too seriously .
I used to justify those kids with a lot of money .
I went to see the <unk> , and I saw my <unk> as adults .
and I started thinking , what happened ?
how could a judge a judge become a different person ?
the judge says he &apos;s adults , but I only see one child .
and one night I woke up , and I wasn &apos;t alone , and I was thinking , &quot; Oh my God , if the judge can write you another person , there must be magic . &quot;
by Brian , this judge has magic .
you can &apos;t afford it .
because I slept too late , my brain didn &apos;t know that I started a bill .
I had a date , when I was 14 , a black child .
and I started working on his defense title , &quot; <unk> : 30 percent of the dark black kids wanted to be a four @-@ year @-@ olds . &quot;
in this initiative , I said , &quot; <unk> , the police station , the court . &quot;
the courts , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the courts , were all on purpose .
and the next morning I woke up and I thought , did I do a dream , or did I really write this proposal ?
and the scary thing about this is , not only did I send me to the court .
and a few months later , forgotten that .
and I decided , oh my gosh , I have to do this case .
I jumped in and felt nervous -- very nervous .
and I went to the court .
and I &apos;m thinking , it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , it &apos;s going to be painful .
and I finally got out of the car , and I got to the court .
when I got on the stairs , there was a black <unk> , the <unk> cleaner .
he saw me running , and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; I &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; You , you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
and this <unk> came to me and hugged me .
he kind of <unk> in my ear .
he said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and I &apos;ve got to admit to you , this gives me a little bit of protection .
and he reminded me that I was deep in my self that I was reminded that each of us should contribute to society , towards a better future .
so I went to the court .
I walked in , and the judge saw me .
&quot; Mr. <unk> , are you writing this ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; Yes , this is what I wrote . &quot; we started to argue .
people came in , because people were upset .
I did write a lot of stuff .
the police came in , and the prosecution came in , and they came in .
and I hadn &apos;t come back , and the whole court room was full of outrage , because we &apos;re talking about race , we &apos;re talking about poverty , we &apos;re talking about poverty .
and I was walking around the corner of the shed .
he kept on <unk> , and he would hear people complain .
and he walked like this .
and finally , this black guy came in , and he was worried about sitting behind me , and almost immediately , there was a ban .
ten minutes later , the judge agreed .
during the rest of the day , one of the guards refused to get to the court .
and the first mate jumps and goes to the <unk> .
&quot; Jimmy , what are you going to the court ? &quot;
this old black guy stood up and looked at this <unk> , and he said , &quot; I come in and I want to tell this young man to go ahead and see it better . &quot;
I &apos;ve come to TED today because I believe a lot of people here understand that the moral <unk> of the world , although it &apos;s a long way , it &apos;s going to tilt the side of it .
before we start to care about human rights and dignity , we can &apos;t really accomplish evolution .
our survival and the survival of each individual is pretty amazing .
our vision of technology and design has to do with the vision of design , of philanthropy , of philanthropy , of philanthropy .
and the most important of all , I want to tell you , go ahead and see it better .
thank you .
you &apos;ve got to hear the audience , the community wants to help you , the willingness to make a difference .
what can we do instead of writing a check for you ?
Brian : there are many opportunities .
for example , if you live in California , there &apos;s a referendum in which we &apos;re going to <unk> the money we &apos;re spending on <unk> people .
for example , in California , we &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars in the next five years -- 100 million .
and at the same time , forty @-@ six of them were not killed .
fifty percent of the <unk> went through it .
and this poll was an opportunity to change .
this was a poll that gave money to spend on law enforcement and on security .
and I think that we can help .
in the last three decades , there &apos;s a drop in crime .
and some people say that part of the reason for this is that there &apos;s a lot of decline .
what would you do about that ?
Brian actually , the crime rate has barely changed .
the rate of death in this country is not in violent crime .
it &apos;s the abuse of drugs .
that &apos;s the main reason why we live in prison .
we &apos;re a little too far too far off <unk> .
and at the same time , we had a three @-@ channel , so we could get people to be forever because they stole a bicycle , or a little bit of <unk> , and we didn &apos;t give them the opportunity to pay for the victim .
and I believe that we need more help from people who are not <unk> them .
and I think that the philosophical philosophy of today is without altruism .
and I think it should change .
Brian , you &apos;re ready to help you out .
you &apos;re really excited about this guy .
thank you very much for coming to TED . thank you .
<unk> : after Bin Laden was killed , there was a lot of danger .
encounter two : Somalia appear in Somalia , <unk> : the police used pepper spray .
Di : <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
6 : <unk> <unk> . <unk> : 65 people died .
<unk> : the tsunami warning . <unk> 9 : cyberattacks .
and then there &apos;s a third line : drug war , mass destruction , tornadoes , etc .
there was a recession , a recession , a recession , an Egyptian , Syria .
crisis , death , disasters .
Oh my gosh !
Peter Gabriel : so this is some of the video that I &apos;ve collected in the last six months , and if it &apos;s six days , or in the last six years , it can be easily collected .
the point is that news media tend to teach us about the negative information , because our brains are particularly focused on this .
and of course , the brain does that for a reason .
and all the time , our sensors &quot; collect a lot of information , so we don &apos;t process it .
and none of that information is more important than living information , and the first line of information is a very primitive component of the temporal lobe .
the brain stem is our early detection , dangerous Geiger .
it <unk> all of the information and looks at it , looks at any threat in the environment .
so whenever we open the newspaper , we &apos;re not automatically reading all kinds of negative information .
that used to be a newspaper in the past : &quot; the <unk> headline . &quot; it turns out .
and now we have all kinds of digital devices , all the time , all the way around us , all of which we can be pessimistic .
no wonder people think the world is backwards .
but it might be true .
not that way , the information that we receive is distorted .
our society has tremendous improvement in the impact of a series of events in the last century , and in fact , we have a tendency to create a rich world .
and I &apos;m not suggesting that these problems don &apos;t exist -- climate crisis , species disappearing , water and energy .
as humans , we &apos;re so good at predicting the crisis , but we end up <unk> them .
let &apos;s look at what happened in the last century , to understand where we &apos;re going .
over the last hundred years , the average lifespan has increased by two times , inflation has adjusted for inflation , and income per person in the world has increased by three times .
the child mortality goes down 10 times .
food , electricity , transportation , communication costs reduced by 10 to 1,000 times less .
Steve <unk> pointed out that we are living in the most peaceful times of human history .
and Charles <unk> said that the world has gone up from 25 to 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we live in a great time .
and a lot of people forget that .
we kept expecting higher expectations .
in fact , we changed the concept of poverty .
if you think about it , most people in the United States today live in poverty still have electricity , drinking water , toilets , televisions , action phones , air conditioning and cars .
the <unk> <unk> of the century , the <unk> of the Earth , could never imagine this .
and the basis of all of this is technology , and the technology of recent exponential growth .
and my good friend Ray <unk> showed the tools of any given information technology to follow this curve , namely Moore &apos;s Law , and double the price performance rate every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why your mobile phone calls in your pocket are 10,000 times cheaper than you used to in the 1970s , and it &apos;s about 1,000 times cheaper .
look at the curve .
this is Moore &apos;s Law from the last hundred years .
I want you to notice the two things that the curved curve is .
first , it &apos;s very smooth -- whether it &apos;s good or bad , whether it &apos;s war or peace or peace , or recession or growth .
that &apos;s because faster computers are used to make faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t slow down because of the enormous challenges we face .
even on the left @-@ hand side , it &apos;s still upward .
technology accelerated itself .
on this Moore &apos;s Law curve , it &apos;s a series of powerful technologies for all of us .
cloud computing , my friends in Autodesk described as an infinite amount of computing : sensors and networks , robotics , 3D printing , allowing us to get the capacity of mass production around the world , artificial life ; bringing new fuels , vaccination , medicine , medicine and intelligence .
how many of you have seen the IBM super @-@ Watson computers in the audience ?
that &apos;s great .
I looked at newspaper headlines , and I found the best news .
and I like this : &quot; Watson <unk> the human race . &quot;
and it &apos;s not an easy game .
the key is to understand the subtle details of the human language .
and you can imagine the kinds of artificial intelligence where all the people who have the action calls can be used .
four years ago at TED , Ray <unk> and I started a new university called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
we teach students about how to use these technologies to solve the enormous challenges facing humanity .
every single year we &apos;ve asked students to create a company or make a product or a service that could have a positive impact on a billion people &apos;s lives .
imagine a group of students could have an impact on a billion people &apos;s lives today .
it sounds ridiculous 30 years ago .
and today we can list companies that have this .
when I think about creating a rich society , it &apos;s not about creating a luxury of living for everyone on the planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
it was a way of getting resources out there .
technology is relative , and technology is an instrument of liberation .
let me give you an example .
this is a story of Napoleon &apos;s <unk> in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s on the left .
I invited <unk> for dinner .
all Napoleon &apos;s soldiers were using gold plates , and Napoleon himself was using gold plates .
but the king of Thailand uses aluminum <unk> .
aluminum used to be the most concentrated metal in the world , much more expensive than gold and gold .
that &apos;s why the top one is aluminum .
even aluminum foil , though it &apos;s not a metal form .
it &apos;s a combination of oxygen and oxygen .
but then there &apos;s the <unk> technology that makes the aluminum price so low that we can see it as <unk> .
let &apos;s apply that to other things .
let &apos;s think about energy shortage .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that contains about 5,000 pounds of energy per year .
forty @-@ 16 megawatts of energy to the Earth &apos;s surface in 88 minutes .
the problem is not that energy is scarce ; it &apos;s accessible .
there &apos;s a couple of good news .
this year , for the first time in India , the cost of solar energy reduced to half of the fossil fuels -- <unk> , 17 rupees .
the cost of solar power in the last year has halved .
and last month , MIT announced a research report showing that in the region of the United States , the cost of solar power traveled to six cents a kilowatt @-@ hour , which is 15 cents .
if we have enough energy , we have a lot of clean water .
let &apos;s get out of the water .
remember ? 1990 , the <unk> of the <unk> was going through Saturn , facing the earth .
took a famous photo , what was called ?
&quot; a pixel . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
the Earth is covered with water .
yes , two and a half percent of sea water is iceberg , and we &apos;re fighting water for the world , but we still have hope .
there &apos;s a technology that &apos;s being put into the application , not 10 years from now , 20 years from now .
there &apos;s a nano @-@ technology .
this morning I was talking to a great DIY inventor , Dean Kamen , and I &apos;d like to share with you -- and I got his technology -- and he developed this technique called &quot; <unk> , &quot; which some of you may have heard about , and it &apos;s a pretty small fridge .
you can grow 1,000 liters of water every day -- water , pollution , water , water , water -- make 1,000 liters of clean drinking water , each of which is less than two cents a day .
the president of Coke &apos;s recent president , in many developing countries , has conducted a massive test on <unk> .
if it &apos;s successful , I &apos;m confident that it will be successful , Coke will be deployed around the world in a country that will deploy the device .
and that &apos;s where technology has come from .
we see this on the mobile phone .
my God , at the end of 2013 , the mobile phone in the developing world will reach 70 percent .
think about it . a soldier in the middle of Kenya had better motion than he had 25 years ago .
if they visit Google with their smartphone , they get more knowledge and information about 15 years ago than President Clinton .
they live in a world where information and communications can &apos;t be predicted .
and better yet , we spend hundreds of millions of dollars getting -- GPS , TV and medical diagnostic technologies , and medical diagnostic technologies -- not getting <unk> to your mobile phone .
the best part of this is probably medicine .
and last month , I had the privilege of working with the <unk> Foundation to <unk> a 1,000 @-@ dollar <unk> .
we challenged our team around the world to bring these technologies together in mobile devices , and you could talk to it , because it had artificial intelligence , and it was coughing up , or <unk> .
to win the competition , the device needs to give you better diagnosis than a group of physicians who have been approved .
imagine a facility where fewer physicians , 25 percent of the disease burden of only 1.3 percent of the medical researchers .
if this device does not recognize the RNA or DNA of a virus , it calls the control center of a disease to prevent a pandemic .
there &apos;s also the power of the rich world .
I call it the <unk> billion . &quot;
that white line is the population .
more than seven billion people on Earth today .
by the way , the best way to prevent the explosion of population is to get more education around the world .
in 2010 , we have nearly two billion people connected to the Internet .
by 2020 , the Internet users will grow from two billion to five billion .
three billion people are not aware of new users , are going to be involved in this global conversation .
what do they want ?
what would they consume ? what would their wish be ?
we &apos;re going to be the biggest , economic dynamic , not a recession .
these are the people who represent hundreds of millions of dollars , and they &apos;re going to put into a global economy .
they &apos;re going to get better , because they &apos;re going to get better , they &apos;re going to get better , and they &apos;re going to get more productive , and they &apos;re going to get more productive than they &apos;ve ever been in the past .
what would it take for us as a community of three billion dollars ?
a series of <unk> that we never had before .
and people who were given <unk> , or other difficult , were given opportunities for attention and help .
what &apos;s the combination of 30 ?
maybe we haven &apos;t seen anything yet .
and one of the things that I &apos;ve learned in the course of the winning X @-@ ray is that the focus of ideas , the passionate team , can achieve extraordinary success , the only thing you can do in the past .
let me share with you a story as a end , and the story is very exciting .
some of you may have heard about this project .
it &apos;s a game called <unk> .
it came from the University of Seattle .
it &apos;s a gene sequence that allows one person to take an amino acids and analyze how the proteins are folded .
the way it folds determine the structure and function of the amino acids .
this is a very important medical research .
it wasn &apos;t until now that it was a problem solved by super @-@ computer .
the first one was a university professor .
and then hundreds of people would go online and play this game .
it also shows that the pattern of human recognition is still better than the best computer .
when you synthesize the best folding experts , it &apos;s not a professor at MIT , it &apos;s not a student at Caltech , it &apos;s a British woman from Manchester , who was working in a hospital for recovery , and at night , the best proteins in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gave me enormous confidence in the future is that each of us as individuals has been challenged to challenge the challenges of the world .
we have technology and tools to grow fast .
there &apos;s also a passion for DIY inventors .
everybody has the power to be a technological philanthropist .
at the same time , there &apos;s 30 million people coming to the line , working with us on a massive challenge , doing what we have to do .
we &apos;re going to be on a few decades .
thank you .
and I think one culture in medicine today has to start changing .
and this change can start with a doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and perhaps because I &apos;ve been in medicine for many years , I can afford to give up some of these things .
let &apos;s start by talking about baseball .
why not ?
and as soon as the usual competition starts , the world &apos;s job baseball competition is coming .
we all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
there are hundreds of thousands of deaf people in the world .
let &apos;s look at the data .
the movie &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is about data , and how to build a great team based on the data .
I want to talk about one data that I want you to hear about .
it &apos;s called the bat rate .
and when we say a ball @-@ ball bat , the ball <unk> .
we mean that this player has a very stable , and every 10 times you have three <unk> .
and <unk> meant that <unk> were hit and put into the garbage bags , and they weren &apos;t going to be killed immediately , and the ball wasn &apos;t going to be successful before the <unk> got there .
there are three <unk> in the 10 .
do you know what the Little League players do ?
great , great , star players .
and you know what they call a bat with 40 percent .
is it the four players who hit each 10 ?
it &apos;s a legacy -- like Ted Williams -- he &apos;s the last baseball players in baseball -- and there &apos;s over 40 percent bat in <unk> .
now let &apos;s go back to my world -- medical field . I &apos;m familiar with this , but I &apos;m going to talk about something that bothers me .
suppose you had a <unk> , and then you were recommended to take a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ pound surgeon in an <unk> .
it sounds strange , right ?
and if you live in a very remote area , and the two coronary arteries that you love are crushed . and your <unk> recommended her <unk> to a unit of blood vessels forming on a <unk> strike .
but wait a minute , you know what ?
she has a big increase in performance this year , and her level is recovered .
her hit hit &quot; hit &quot; hit 5 . &quot;
but it &apos;s not acceptable .
and I want to ask you a question .
do you think that a heart surgeon , or a professional doctor , is a surgeon <unk> a doctor or an emergency manager of an emergency hospital ?
<unk> ? very good .
in fact , no one in the medical community knows what a good surgeon or an emergency manager should have .
we tell each of them , including myself , putting a career in a professional position , telling them to be perfect .
absolutely , there &apos;s no trial at all -- but we make them think about detail , about how to do that .
that &apos;s what I got at medical school .
I &apos;m a student who has an obsessive tendency .
and one of the students in high school said , Brian <unk> will review it for a blood test .
and I did .
and I ended up in a small <unk> in a van in Toronto , and finished my studies .
I <unk> everything .
and I dove in the autopsy list of every single piece of muscle and <unk> , each of which is an extension of the artery from the aorta , and all the things that are known , or the usual suspects .
and I even knew how to judge different <unk> .
and during that time , I accumulate more and more knowledge .
I did a good job , and I graduated with the <unk> grades .
when I came out of medical school , I felt like I could just guess all of the stuff -- or take a step closer -- almost everything , and the odds of my errors would be very small .
and I didn &apos;t make mistakes in a matter of time , until I met seven women .
when a woman was brought into a medical emergency room in Toronto , I was working as an emergency room .
and I ended up in a cardiac cardiac cardiac wireless clinic .
and my job is , when the emergency workers need a full @-@ spectrum of people on the edge of the heart , they &apos;re being diagnosed in a lung hospital .
and then I report on my report .
and when I met <unk> lady , her breath was very faint .
I heard her breath when I spoke to her .
and when I listened to her chest , there was a crack sound from the sides of her chest that told me that this is the <unk> heart failure .
and this is because of the heart failure , you can &apos;t get all the blood intact , and that leads to some parts of the blood coming back into the lung , and it &apos;s filled with blood and breathing .
this is not a difficult diagnostic .
and after I made the diagnosis , I started to help her .
and I gave her the aspirin , and gave her some medicine that could actually afford her heart .
and I gave her a couple of <unk> , <unk> , to help her take the extra water out of her body .
she started getting better in the next two or three hours .
and I was thrilled .
and that &apos;s when I made the first mistake : I made her home home .
and by the way , I made two mistakes .
and I put her back home in my report with my family .
I didn &apos;t do what I was supposed to do , pick up the phone call and give him a look at this case , give him an opportunity to meet this patient .
I knew her , so I could give her more detailed data .
maybe I have the reason for that .
maybe I don &apos;t want to do the kind of thing that always needs to be .
maybe I can &apos;t help you out , and I can &apos;t help but communicate with my patient .
and the second mistake I made was even more serious .
and as I was leaving her home , I ignored a little voice in my heart , and the voice was trying to tell me , &quot; Don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , I wasn &apos;t confident at the time that I even looked for a woman who was looking after her , and she said , &quot; Do you think she &apos;d come home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought , and then he said , &quot; Well , I think there &apos;s no problem . &quot;
and it seemed to me that this was happening yesterday .
I signed up at the hospital bed , an ambulance <unk> her home .
and I went back to work in my clinic .
in the next day , in the afternoon , my gut had a kind of gut feeling .
but I still work .
and at the end of the work , I went out and I left the hospital , and as I walked into the parking lot , I did something that I couldn &apos;t normally do .
I borrowed from the emergency room .
and there was another nurse , not the other woman who took care of a woman , who told me that most of the doctors were afraid to hear .
other doctors who were scared of these three words , but because of the fact that the patient looked at the doctor , the three words were particularly meaningful for us .
these three words : remember ?
do you remember that guy you sent home ? &quot;
the nurse asked .
&quot; she comes back . &quot; she used that regular tone .
she did come back .
it &apos;s been dying back .
after I got her home about an hour later , she was on the ground , and her family hit 9 / 11 , and the emergency man brought her back to the emergency room . she had a big shock , half of her blood pressure .
her breathing was incredibly weak , <unk> .
the folks got a real estate .
they gave her increased blood pressure .
and she connected her <unk> .
and I was shocked and shocked .
and then I was feeling a little bit like a <unk> , because when they <unk> her stability , they put her in an emergency room , and I wanted her to wake up in despair .
but in the next two or three days , she never woke up again .
her brain had been torn apart .
her family came together .
and in the course of the following months , they slowly accept that .
at the end of the season , they chose her to leave the person -- the lady , the wife of a family , and the grandmother .
some people say you &apos;re never going to forget the names of the dead people you have given .
and that was the first time I realized this .
in the next couple of weeks , I was so frustrated , and I had the first time in which there was a danger in medicine -- I felt alone . it wasn &apos;t a sense of shame , because you couldn &apos;t talk about it .
and that is that , when you <unk> your commitment to a friend and you agree to be conservative , and then you know , your best friend will look for you , even though you &apos;re arguing about it , but that guilt will still dominate your face , and I will tell you , I will never do the same thing .
and then you &apos;ve made a <unk> commitment , and you &apos;re never going to <unk> .
there &apos;s a sense of shame .
and the kind of non @-@ toxic shame that I &apos;m talking about is what makes you feel .
it would tell you , it &apos;s not your fault ; it &apos;s your bad guy .
that &apos;s how I felt .
and that &apos;s not because of my <unk> ; others are pretty good .
he talked to the family . I knew he had not been accused of making sure that I hadn &apos;t hit me .
but I kept asking myself questions .
why didn &apos;t I connect my face ? why did I get her home ?
and I was even more depressed , and I said , &quot; Why do I do this stupid thing ? &quot;
why do I go to medicine ?
slowly but steady , then it began to <unk> .
and I started to feel <unk> .
and then in a sunny day , when I saw a flash of light , I felt , maybe I could feel good again .
and then I made an appointment with myself : if I could do perfect , I could no longer make mistakes , and please let that go .
the sound actually stops .
I went back to work .
but it happened again .
two years later , when I was in a hospital in Northern Toronto , I saw a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man on his throat .
and the clinic was busy , so I was a little bit quick .
and he pointed over here .
and I looked at his throat a little bit of <unk> .
and I sent him a recipe and left him out .
even when he stepped out of the door of the clinic , he seemed to be pointing at his throat .
two days later , I was on the emergency room of the emergency room , and the director of my room had to go to private .
she said those three words : remember ?
&quot; remember ? who have you seen the throat of the throat ? &quot;
he didn &apos;t have any sexual activity .
what you have to do is something that could threaten life , something called <unk> .
you can look at Google , but it &apos;s not throat , it &apos;s an infection of <unk> , and there might be respiratory <unk> .
luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
and after a couple of days of being given up to a antibiotic , he was cured .
and I went back to that moment of guilt and regret , and then I took a step back to work , and then went back to work , and then it happened again .
at the same pace of the same month , I didn &apos;t see the patient had any results .
it &apos;s very difficult to imagine what happens , especially when you &apos;re in a hospital where you work at night .
and although for those two cases , I didn &apos;t have them come home , and I didn &apos;t feel like there was any void and errors in the process .
one of the things I found was that he had a diagnosis .
and he set up kidney X @-@ ray , but it turned out to be normal . and my colleagues were <unk> on the patient &apos;s condition , and he noticed that there were some soft sensors on the right @-@ hand side of the patient .
another patient has severe diarrhea .
and I gave him some liquid to replace it , and then my colleagues looked at it .
he did it . and he noticed that the patient was soft and soft , and he connected the surgeons .
both of these patients did surgery and recovered .
but when I think about those two cases , they would suffer from me .
and I also hope that I can tell you that the worst mistake I &apos;ve ever made is only five years ago when I started practicing medicine , like many of my colleagues said , &quot; But it &apos;s completely true .
in the last five years , I &apos;ve made some mistakes .
I still felt lonely , shame .
but the crux of the problem is , if I can &apos;t explain and talk about the wrong mistakes I &apos;ve made , if I can &apos;t find the answer to the wrong source , how can I share my experiences with my colleagues ?
how do I teach them not to repeat my mistakes ?
and when I walk into a situation where -- like right now , I don &apos;t know how you think about me .
have you ever heard someone talk about their own failure over and over again ?
yes , if you go to a party and you may hear something about other doctors &apos; mistakes , but you don &apos;t hear somebody talking about mistakes .
and if I walked into a room in my colleague right now , looking for help and starting to talk to them about what I told you about , maybe even before I even tell you about two stories , they begin to get very uncomfortable . some of them start making a joke , and then they change the topic .
in fact , if I were , or my colleague , I knew that one of my colleagues in the hospital had broken his legs and I believed , when I met him , I couldn &apos;t mix them with normal eyes .
that &apos;s the kind of system we have .
an absolute denial system .
there are only two people in this system -- mistakes of being wrong , can suffer from sleep loss and <unk> , and the outcome of bad outcomes and good outcomes .
it &apos;s almost like the self @-@ organizing response of a immune system , like the antibodies typically attacking that different person .
we have an idea that when we reach all the mistakes we make , we get a safe system .
but that idea raises two questions .
in my first paper on <unk> radio and news , from my first paper that I wrote in Toronto , I wrote &quot; The <unk> , &quot; where I discovered myself studying everything I could access to .
and what I &apos;ve learned is that mistakes are everywhere .
we work in a system where we get errors every day , and the hospital has a 10 percent chance of getting a dose or giving a bad dose , and in hospitals are increasingly becoming increasingly infected , having unnecessary harm and death .
in this country , there are nearly 20,000 people dying of medical mistakes that can avoid .
in the United States , according to the Institute of Medicine , there were 10 million people .
and even so , both of these numbers have underestimated the reality , because we never looked at the problem as we should .
the point is that .
in a medical knowledge system , in two to three years the year @-@ olds , we can &apos;t measure the growth of that knowledge .
sleep deprivation is absolutely universal .
and we can &apos;t get rid of that .
our own instinct bias can also affect our conclusion , for example , and I can record the perfect clinical record for a patient .
but if the same patient with a naked eye , with a little bit of alcohol , I would write down a little bit of <unk> .
and this is a completely different record .
I &apos;m not a robot . I don &apos;t do the same thing every time .
my patients aren &apos;t cars , they &apos;re not going to describe their symptoms in the same way .
so mistakes are inevitable .
and if I were taught that the system was as easy as any health professionals that went awry , there would be no staff .
and it &apos;s about people who don &apos;t want to talk about the worst mistake they have .
in my show , &quot; <unk> , &quot; I &apos;ve said , &quot; <unk> : &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; and I would say to anyone who has come from an emergency situation to a leading surgeon , &quot; This is my worst mistake . &quot; and I would hand them , &quot; You know , what ?
their pupils dilate , they <unk> , they look at the ground , they <unk> and they start telling me their stories .
they want to tell their stories , and they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; Listen , <unk> and I am wrong . &quot;
they just need a moment to get their hands off .
what they need is an <unk> medical culture .
start with a single individual doctor .
doctors who were once <unk> , who understood herself as a human being , and accept the fact that she didn &apos;t make a mistake , she could learn from it and learn from it .
she shared her experience with other people .
and they were backed by other people &apos;s issues .
she doesn &apos;t have a sense of <unk> , but it &apos;s only a way to get everyone out of that job , to figure out what &apos;s wrong with others .
and the medical culture of her work acknowledged that the whole system was run by people , and when someone was operating in a system , sometimes it was sometimes impossible .
and the system can evolve over and over and over again , and it can make it easier for us to see things that we can &apos;t avoid , but at the same time , we can create a care @-@ caring environment where every single one of the people in our healthcare system suggests that some of the unexpected mistakes that encourage us , especially if we face them wrong .
I &apos;m Brian <unk> .
I &apos;m a physician who <unk> his definition .
I &apos;m a human , and I make mistakes .
I was sorry for that , but I would try to learn and learn from it .
I still don &apos;t know how you think about me , but I think I can .
and I ended up making three words for myself : I remember .
in the 1950s , in the East of communism , if you had a typewriter , you had to sign the government .
you had to be registered by the phrase of the typewriter .
so this is where the government can follow text .
if they find a single page of the wrong point , they can track who generated that .
and in the West , we can &apos;t understand how someone can do this , and how free speech can be .
we will never do that in our own country .
but today , 2011 , if you buy a page from any of the biggest <unk> manufacturer , a page printed page , and then you end up having a little bit of paper on every page on every page that makes it unique to you and your printer .
that &apos;s what happens to us today .
it seemed like no one was making a difference .
this is an example of what our government uses for technology to deal with our citizens .
this is one of the three major sources of the Internet .
if we look at what happens in the online world , we identify with the attacker of the attacker .
we have three major groups .
we have online criminals .
here , we have a gentleman from Jean @-@ Claude <unk> .
online criminals are easily understood .
these guys were making money .
they make a lot of money online attacks , lots of money .
we actually have several cases of <unk> , <unk> , all made by <unk> attacks .
and here comes <unk> from Estonia .
this is Alfred <unk> .
this is Stephen Hawking .
this is <unk> <unk> .
this is Matthew Anderson , a silver lining , etc .
these people were making a lot of money online , but they were making illegal money by using bank services like <unk> from our accounts when we &apos;re on the Internet , or using <unk> to gather our credit card information when we get infected with an infected computer .
the U.S. intelligence agency , two months ago , froze Mr. <unk> &apos;s bank accounts at the Swiss bank accounts , and there were <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
Mr. <unk> himself remained alone ; nobody knew where he was .
today , I would argue that any of us may be a victim of online crime , even beyond reality .
and it &apos;s obviously getting worse .
in the future , most of the crime will happen online .
the second group of attacks that we &apos;re looking at today are not due to money .
and their motivation came from other places -- because of protest , for <unk> , for ridiculed .
these anonymous groups were actively active in the last 12 months and turned into the key participants in the online attack .
these are the key players in the field : for the money , the anonymous attacks , the anonymous attacks , the last group of people , the government attacks .
let &apos;s take an example of what happens in a company called <unk> .
this is a typical example of government attacking his people .
<unk> is a authority in Holland , or it used to be .
it happened last fall in business because they were hacked .
some people shredded it completely .
and I asked a meeting last week at the conference , to see if a leader had discovered that there was a possibility that someone could die from an attack on fire .
his answer was yes .
so , how did people die from such an attack ?
<unk> is an authority certificate .
they sell their certificate .
what do you do with your certificate ?
you need a certificate , which is that you have a website that has self @-@ encryption , encrypted services , things like <unk> .
now all of us , or most of us , use <unk> or any one of our opponents , are services that are particularly popular in <unk> countries , like Iran , <unk> use foreign services , because they know they &apos;re more reliable than local services , and they &apos;re monitoring , so the government is unable to talk about them .
they could also , if they attacked a foreign authority .
thirty @-@ two <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of <unk> .
what happens in the Arab region , like in Egypt ?
in Egypt , the riots had <unk> the headquarters for the Egyptian government , in April of 2011 , they found a lot of documents .
in these documents , there was a paper called <unk> .
there are some notes from a German company , and this company sells a set of tools for the Egyptian government to take -- a large percentage of all communication in the public .
they sold this tool to the Egyptian government for 28 Euros .
the headquarters for companies are right there .
so the Western government provides the tools to identify their own citizens .
but the Western government also did it for themselves .
for example , in Germany , it was discovered a few weeks ago by the German government of Germany , in Germany , in Germany , and they were government searching for their own citizens .
if you &apos;re a <unk> to vote , it &apos;s obvious that your eye is being heard .
but today , things are beyond .
they &apos;re going to watch your Internet connection .
they &apos;re going to use tools like <unk> to infect your computer so that they can monitor all of your communications , listen to your online , gather your password .
and when we think about it a little bit deeper , it &apos;s obvious that people say , &quot; Oh yeah , that sounds bad , but because I &apos;m a legitimate citizen , I don &apos;t really influence me .
why should I care ?
I don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
that &apos;s where the argument is , there &apos;s no reason .
privacy is determined .
privacy doesn &apos;t have to talk .
it &apos;s not a question of security .
it &apos;s a question of freedom control .
we will trust our government in 2011 , and we will lose any power .
will we trust the future government , blindly trusting , a government after 50 years ?
these are the questions we have to worry about in the next 50 years .
it may sound a little bit strange . I &apos;m a <unk> player .
the first one was made in <unk> , which was a very simple idea : to embed the concrete blocks of concrete together .
very quickly became the largest building block in the world .
it allows us to make things more than ourselves , buildings , bridges , bridge them , so that we can &apos;t afford it .
the actual Lego blocks have become essentially the Lego blocks of our age .
in 1947 , about 100 years later , the Lego came out .
they were called self @-@ assembly .
and within a few years , the Lego companies occupied every household .
it &apos;s been estimated that there are over four billion dollars built -- or 75 dollars per person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer who can build beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
the Lego is possible .
the Lego essentially is to take the Lego blocks , the real world &apos;s Lego blocks , and then use the building blocks that we imagine .
and in the same year alone , a new revolution is about to launch , next generation of them .
transistors are a small plastic component that will take us from a static building to a new world where everything can interact .
you can use it as a transistor transistors , and you can create larger , more complicated circuits .
but there &apos;s a major difference : only experts can play transistors .
I personally can &apos;t accept the only experts in our time , so I decided to change it .
when I was in the media lab about eight years ago , I started thinking about how we could empower the engineers and the designers .
a few years ago , I started developing <unk> .
I &apos;ll show you how it works .
<unk> are modules that have a specific function in each of them .
they all set in advance as light , motors , sensors .
and the best thing about them is they &apos;re using magnets , and they &apos;re embedded in this together .
so you &apos;re not going to be able to build a mistake .
the bits are separated by color .
green is the output , the blue is the power , and the pink is the orange one .
so what you need to do is you take the blue and you get the green , and then you start making bigger circuits .
you take the blue one and you make a light .
you can put a dial in the middle and you can make a little <unk> .
you take out a bunch of pulse tiles , and now you create a little light .
add the pressure up to the point where you create a noise machine .
I had to .
except for the simple act , it &apos;s actually very powerful .
you don &apos;t need programming , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to get you to do it with simple intuition .
so for example , if you &apos;re going to shine a little bit , you just have to turn the button and actually make it a little bit faster or slower .
and the idea behind the scenes is that this is a material that &apos;s grown .
we wanted to take every single single act of interaction in the world and make them available everywhere .
the light , the solar panels , the motors -- everything should be <unk> .
we used to show the kids and see them playing .
that was an incredible experience .
and the best thing is that they start to understand the appliances that they &apos;re in their daily lives .
so for example , how <unk> work , or why the iPod can still drive , or the iPod can react to the touch .
we also used to bring design to design schools .
for example , we used to have designers who had no experience at all start with materials from scratch .
and as you can see , it &apos;s made out of <unk> and paper .
a few weeks ago , we went to Rhode Island School of Design to give it to designers that have no engineered experience , just to some cardboard , wood and paper -- and to them , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
this is a project they finished , a feedback loop on a feedback loop .
wait a minute , this is actually one of my favorites .
it &apos;s a &quot; play @-@ dough , &quot; and it &apos;s pretty annoying .
for these technologists , <unk> became another kind of material , and electrons are just a material .
and we want to make this material available for everyone .
so open source is open source .
you can go to the website and download all of the design files , and make it yourself .
we want to encourage a world where people are inventors and inventors , because the world we live in , the world of interaction , belongs to each of us .
don &apos;t get anywhere , start your invention .
thank you .
when I was 11 years old , remember one morning , hearing pleasure in the family .
my father was listening to the BBC in his little <unk> radio .
and he couldn &apos;t see it , because most of the news would cause him to be depressed .
the Taliban came . the father was screaming .
I don &apos;t know what that means , but I can see the father is very happy .
&quot; you can now go to a real school . &quot; he said .
I will never forget that morning .
a real school .
when I was six years old , the Taliban took over Afghanistan and said that girls were illegal .
so in the next five years , I was hanging out with my sister to a secret school where my sister was never allowed to go .
this is the only education way we have .
we &apos;re going to walk different routes every day so there &apos;s no doubt where we &apos;re going .
we put the books on the food chain so people think we &apos;re just buying them .
schools are packed in a single room .
the winter was very comfortable , but the summer was freezing .
we all know that we &apos;re at risk of living -- teachers , students , parents .
and sometimes , the schools will be suspended by the Taliban .
we &apos;re always worried about being discovered by the Taliban .
are we tracking ?
do they know our place ?
we were scared , but we still wanted to go to school .
I was fortunate to grow up in a family that valued and loved daughter .
my grandfather was a remarkable man in his age .
he was born in Afghanistan , and he had different ideas , and he insisted that his daughter , my mom , went to school , and was cut off by his father .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
that &apos;s her .
she retired two years ago , and she turned my house into a school where girls and girls in the community .
my father -- that &apos;s him -- he &apos;s the first person in his family to be educated .
so no doubt , his child should be educated , including his daughter , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
for him , the child doesn &apos;t receive education is a greater risk .
in the Taliban , in those years of Afghanistan , I remember that sometimes I would be depressed about my life , and I would be afraid of the future .
I wanted to give up , but my father would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you may lose anything in your life .
your money could be stole , and you could be <unk> by the war .
and the only thing that you can live with is that if we have to pay for your tuition , we &apos;re going to be naked .
do you even want to continue ? &quot;
now I &apos;m 22 .
I grew up in a country that had been destroyed by decades of war .
there were less than six percent of the women in my age , and if I wasn &apos;t a family member , I would be like most people .
and now I &apos;m a proud college student .
one of the top songs of the United States is one of the top songs of the United States , and in 2012 , when I went back to Afghanistan , my grandfather and my daughter got kicked out of the house , and first marked me <unk> .
he was proud of not only my college education , but also because in women , I was the first , in women , and I was the first person to drive him around the streets of Kabul .
my family trusted me .
I had a big dream , but they were expecting me to be even higher .
that &apos;s why I became the president of Global <unk> , a global organization for women &apos;s education .
and that &apos;s why I got involved in the idea of one of the first , probably the only <unk> in Afghanistan , because in Afghanistan , girls are still very dangerous .
what excites me is that I see students in my school can take chances and ambition .
I saw their parents &apos; parents , and especially their fathers , like my father , who supported them , even from their faces .
for instance , he wasn &apos;t a real name , and I couldn &apos;t let you see his face , he was my father .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter , on the way back to the village , was killed by the side of the road .
and he got home , and the phone rang , and he said , &quot; Well , if he would send his daughter to school , it would happen again .
if you think , now you can kill me . &quot; he said , &quot; But I won &apos;t destroy my daughter &apos;s future for you . &quot;
and for Afghanistan , I realized -- and this is something that no longer exists in the West -- that behind our success , it &apos;s a father -- who can recognize the value of his daughter , the success of his daughter , the success of his daughter .
it &apos;s not that mothers aren &apos;t important for our success .
in fact , for the future of daughter &apos;s daughter , they &apos;re usually the first ones and the most compelling <unk> , but in a society like Afghanistan , we have to have men .
there were only a couple of girls in school in the Taliban -- please don &apos;t forget , they were illegal .
but today , the girls in Afghanistan are over 300 million .
Afghanistan is very different from the United States .
I found that Americans can see the fragility of our change .
and I was worried how long these changes are going to last in the U.S. military .
but when I went back to Afghanistan and saw my students and their support and encouraged their parents , I saw the hope for the future , and I saw the change .
for me , Afghanistan is full of hope and infinite possibilities , and the girls who read them every single day are reminded of me .
like me , they have great dreams .
thank you .
everything that I did , whether it was my life or work , my whole life -- was deeply influenced by the seven years that I worked in Africa .
from 1971 , I looked very young , but actually I was old -- I was in Zambia , Kenya , Algeria , South Africa , Somalia , a group of partnerships with African countries .
I worked in a non @-@ governmental organization , and every project that we set up in Africa failed .
I was panic .
when I was 21 , I felt that we were Italian and we were doing good for Africa .
and yet , what are we doing ?
our first project inspired me to write my first book , which is called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot; and in this case , the Italians decided to teach <unk> .
so , we took the seeds from Italy to the south of Zambia , a spectacular valley to the south , and we taught people to plant tomato and <unk> and so on .
and of course , the local people were not interested in this , so we paid them to work , and they weren &apos;t there for a moment .
we were thrilled about this .
but we didn &apos;t ask them why , and just the <unk> said , &quot; We &apos;re here . &quot;
&quot; help out in the front lines of hunger in the dead people . &quot;
and of course , it &apos;s perfectly fine in Africa .
our own tomatoes are beautiful . it &apos;s <unk> in Italy , a tomatoes in Italy , and it grows in Zambia , so big .
it &apos;s just incredible . we said to Zambia , &quot; Look , it &apos;s easier . &quot;
and when the tomatoes grow up , the <unk> looks pretty well , overnight , the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , all the tomatoes .
and we said , &quot; My god , these damn <unk> ! &quot;
and Zambia said , &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s why we &apos;re not here . &quot;
&quot; why don &apos;t you ever ask ? &quot;
I thought we were <unk> in Africa , but when I knew what happened to Americans in the United States , the British were , and after they had done it , I was very proud of our projects in Zambia .
because , at least , we fed the <unk> .
you should look at the garbage -- you should look at how much rubbish we put in Africa .
and you can read this book , &quot; The <unk> of <unk> , &quot; written by Dan <unk> , an Iraqi woman .
this book was published in 2009 .
we &apos;ve spent two trillion dollars on the continent in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to talk to you about the damage that money has made .
you read it yourself .
let &apos;s look at the damage that we have in Africa .
we are Western <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and there are only two different ways that we deal with people : one , two , three parents .
these two words come from a Latin word , &quot; meaning &quot; father . &quot;
but two words mean different .
parents love to say that I treat different cultures as my child . &quot;
and what <unk> meant was I looked at the other cultures as my servant .
that &apos;s why white people in Africa are called <unk> , which is the owner .
when I read a book , I read &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is &quot; <unk> , &quot; and the author is &quot; <unk> , &quot; and one of the most important things about economic development is that if people don &apos;t want to help , they go .
this should be the primary principles of aid .
the first principles of aid is respect .
this morning , Mr. <unk> , put a stick on the ground and said , &quot; Could we -- can you imagine a city that &apos;s not invaded ? &quot;
when I was 27 years old , I made a decision that was based on the need for people , and I started a work system called <unk> , and we didn &apos;t do the founders , and we didn &apos;t motivate anyone , but the passion for local entrepreneurs to find better places for people .
so what we &apos;re going to do is shut up .
we walked into a community and we weren &apos;t going to impose any ideas on each other , but we were talking to the people .
our workplace is not at the office .
we met with our clients in restaurants and bars .
we don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
what we do is we make friends with them , and we discover their interest and purpose in intent .
the most important thing is passion .
you can ask your customer your ideas .
but what if you &apos;re not interested in each other ?
the client was the most important thing for self @-@ improvement .
the passion for each other is based on self @-@ improvement , which is the most important .
and then we help them collect their knowledge and information , because it &apos;s the world , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
people with ideas don &apos;t necessarily know about things , but we can support them .
so a couple of years ago , I had an idea that we couldn &apos;t have at least one of these ideas , not to impose our ideas on them , but that can &apos;t happen in the form of community meetings .
I &apos;ll tell you a secret .
there &apos;s a problem with community meetings .
the entrepreneurs never went to the public meeting and they never told you where they were going to spend it , and they didn &apos;t have any opportunities .
so there &apos;s a proposal for this .
you don &apos;t even have the smartest people in your community because they &apos;re not even involved in your public gathering .
what we did was , we had to build a social infrastructure for one @-@ to @-@ one , one @-@ to @-@ one .
we have to create a whole new career .
this is a professional equivalent of corporate <unk> , and this business will be facing face @-@ to @-@ face with your household in your kitchen , your kitchen , or your cafe , to help you out the window to transform your entrepreneurial passion into a living skill .
I did an experiment in the <unk> state of Arizona .
and I was a Ph.D. student who was trying to get away from that practice , and then had to do it .
my first year at <unk> , just a walk out of the street , and in those days , I had the first client , and I helped the first person . he was a <unk> , and I was in a garage , and I was able to sell the fish for him , and then the fishermen come and say , &quot; Can you do that ? &quot;
and I had these five fishermen get their job , not to get a nice tuna at 60 cents and sell it to a factory in the United States , but to sell it at 15 dollars a pound for Japan , and then there &apos;s a farmer to come and say , &quot; Hey , can you help them ? &quot;
within a year , I did 27 projects , and the government ran over to me and said , &quot; What do you do ?
how can you -- &quot; I said , &quot; I did something very difficult .
that &apos;s <unk> , listen to them . &quot;
so -- So the government says , &quot; That &apos;s it . &quot;
we started this project in 300 communities around the world .
we have helped build 40,000 companies .
the next generation of entrepreneurs suffer from nothing .
Peter Gabriel , one of the greatest <unk> of all time , died a few years ago , 96 years ago .
Peter Gabriel : before he went to business as a philosophical professor , Peter <unk> once said , &quot; The plan is inherently anti @-@ social and entrepreneurial economy . &quot;
the plan was to give entrepreneurship a lot of money .
now , we rebuild the <unk> , but we don &apos;t know what the most brilliant and the most innovative people want to do with it .
we have to learn how to give these people a message .
we have to give them permission , and respect their privacy , and we have to be good at providing them , so that they come to the door , and that &apos;s it .
in a community of 100,000 people , we have 200 of them .
can you imagine what a community of over 4,000 people gathered , how much intelligence and passion ?
I want you to come from one of the biggest ones .
it &apos;s an incredibly passionate local community . you clap them .
so what I want to say is , pioneering spirit is what &apos;s happening today .
when we were at the end of the first industrial revolution -- we were using fossil fuels , manufacturing -- but we suddenly realized that this was not sustainable .
the internal combustion engine used to run out of fuel .
it &apos;s not <unk> food .
what we &apos;re going to care about now is how we &apos;re going to meet the food , health , education , transportation , communication and communication .
there &apos;s no technology at all .
who could invent this technology for creating a green revolution ? university ?
the government ? don &apos;t you ?
the entrepreneurs , they &apos;re fighting .
many years ago , I saw an intriguing article in a magazine called <unk> .
there &apos;s a group of experts invited to talk about what the future of New York is .
and that &apos;s when you think about them , you know , they &apos;ve come together , they &apos;ve figured out a hundred years later in New York City , and the results of that : 100 years later , there will be no city .
why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population continues to grow this speed , the people in New York will need six million horses , and six million horses will fail to handle .
people will be flooded .
so they think that these dirty technologies will kill life in New York .
so what happened ? 40 years later , in 1900 , there was one , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- one , <unk> <unk> .
we found a new technology , and we found a new factory that went off , and we had a lot more .
so for example , the Ford Motor Company in Michigan , Michigan , was .
however , there &apos;s a secret to entrepreneurs .
one , you &apos;re going to give them commitment .
otherwise they wouldn &apos;t come and talk about you .
and then you have to offer them a passion .
you have to tell them about pioneering spirit .
whether it &apos;s a large company or small company , there are three things that you can do to make a good job : an act of marketing , an act of security , if you &apos;re smart .
what &apos;s the problem ?
there &apos;s never been a single person in the world who is able to produce and sell and finance at the same time .
this person doesn &apos;t exist .
these people are not born .
we surveyed , we looked at 100 of the world &apos;s companies -- Carnegie Mellon @-@ trained companies , Edison , the Ford Motor Company , and all of these companies , <unk> , Yahoo , Yahoo .
all of the successful businesses in the world have one thing in common : no business is created by one .
now we teach young entrepreneurs in Westchester County , we start by taking Richard Branson and using this word &quot; The Little League of Richard Branson . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t do it once , &quot; we did it 32 times .
he wasn &apos;t alone at the beginning .
nobody could start a business alone . nobody .
so we can build a community , and in this community , we have expertise from small businesses , from small businesses , from <unk> , in a cafe , in a pub , in a pub , where we can offer you what an ambition is , we can ask you , &quot; What do you need ?
what can you do ? can you make it ?
can you sell it ? can you build the money ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , I can &apos;t afford that . &quot; does it really mean I have a help for you ? &quot;
we inspire communities to do business .
we have volunteers who help to pool the resources and the human resources , and what we find is that local communities can create wonder , can change the culture and the economy , as long as you can take the passion , this energy , this energy .
thank you .
five years ago , I had an experience that was like a swing of Alice &apos;s <unk> .
and the State University of Pennsylvania gave me the teacher to teach him about communication .
I was horrified .
and I was really frightened . the heads of the students &apos; brains and the <unk> that they read , and the words that they were using were long and long and long , were all frightened .
but as soon as the conversation started , my experience was as Alice , following the rabbit hole , and saw that it <unk> across into a completely new world .
and that &apos;s how I felt when I was talking to the students , and I was amazed by their ideas , and I wanted others to experience that in their <unk> .
and I believe the key to opening the door is to have excellent communication .
in order to change the world , we really need to get good communication from our scientists and engineers .
all of our scientists and engineers solve the biggest problems we face , from energy to the environment , to health care , and so on . if we don &apos;t understand and they don &apos;t understand , they don &apos;t have any sense for us , and I believe we have a responsibility to interact with them as scientists .
but if our scientists and engineers aren &apos;t going to look at our <unk> and see their <unk> , we &apos;re not going to have a great conversation .
so scientists and engineers , please tell us what high tech is .
I want to share with you a couple of useful ways of telling you how to make sure that we also think of your science as sexy and sexy .
the first question is , what about high @-@ tech ?
tell us why your science has something to do with us .
and I want to tell you about <unk> , which is to tell you about why this skeleton is important for recognizing and treatment .
and when you look at the science principles , you have to look at the usage of the jargon .
jargon is that we understand one of your ideas .
and of course , you can say , &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; but why don &apos;t we know more about space and time ?
let your ideas be easy to understand and to simplify it .
instead , as Einstein said , let &apos;s make everything as simple as possible , rather than simplify .
you don &apos;t have to change your perspective to convey your scientific theory .
you can think about using examples , stories , analogies . these are the ones that excite us , the way we &apos;re excited .
and when you show it in the PowerPoint , don &apos;t use points .
have you ever wondered why a <unk> might be called a bullet ?
what are the bullets doing ? the bullet can kill , and it can kill you .
these are not just boring slides , but they &apos;re too dependent on our language areas where we don &apos;t know what to do .
and this is an example made by <unk> Brown , which was much better . it showed us the extraordinary structure of the <unk> , even the unique design of the Eiffel Tower .
and the trick here is to use simple , flat @-@ lined sentences to allow the viewer to take a little bit of <unk> and then provide some images that can inspire our senses , and give us a deeper understanding of what &apos;s described .
these are the key tools that I think will help us open up the doors , the understanding of science and engineering .
so because the engineers I worked with had taught me to come up with an academic <unk> in my heart , I want to conclude with a equations .
in the science that you &apos;ve studied , you &apos;ve got to take your dot and your jargon , divided by related content , by sharing the content with the audience , and then multiply it by the magic that you &apos;re working on , it &apos;s going to equal awareness , incredible interaction .
so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved the equation , everything can be done , say high @-@ tech .
thank you .
one of the words that I love is something called &quot; <unk> &quot; in the Oxford Republic .
not only does it sound good .
and what it means is , &quot; A <unk> politician . &quot;
even though this is just a perfectly good statement from a paper editor in the 19th century , he said the following : &quot; <unk> is a guy like this , he will not care about any party or any principle , he won &apos;t be able to win the law . &quot;
I don &apos;t know what the word &quot; <unk> &quot; means .
it &apos;s about the vocabulary of speech , I suppose .
but speech is very important for the political core , and all politicians understand that they have to try to control their movements .
for example , in the last decade or two , the government has allowed news stories to report the true words of politicians on <unk> .
and the fact that this is actually a brave man , this great name is <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s proposed in Parliament .
he had been put into London &apos;s <unk> , but he was brave enough to have the courage to put it in the parliament , and ended up having a lot of support for him in London .
and just a few years later , we had our first record of using the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
a lot of people think that phrases come from metal .
no , it was a free @-@ press act .
but in order to really demonstrate how words and politics affect each other , I want to take you back to the United States , where it &apos;s just sitting .
and they had a question about how to face the name of George Washington , their leaders .
they don &apos;t know .
why should we be leaders in a republic ?
and that was a long time ago in Congress .
and there &apos;s a lot of advice , and they kind of work .
I mean , some people want to call him the lead bank of Washington , and some people call him George Washington , and other people call him George Washington , D.C. , who call him the <unk> of freedom .
there &apos;s no <unk> names .
some people just want to call him king .
they think it &apos;s a term that used and tested .
they didn &apos;t even follow the monarchy , and the idea was that you could be the king of the election , there was a fixed master .
you know , it probably works .
and everybody was tired of getting bored , and in fact , because the argument continues for three weeks .
I read a journal of the poor legislators at the time , and it was continuing , &quot; This is the issue . &quot;
and the reason that <unk> and <unk> is because of the Senate .
the House of Representatives wanted to let Washington D.C.
they didn &apos;t want to call him the king just in case he or his <unk> had anything .
so they gave him a title that they could think of , the worst , the worst , the worst , the worst .
and the title is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , the President . they didn &apos;t create this title . I mean , it used to be , but it was the owner of a meeting .
similar to the president of the jury .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be very high @-@ status at all .
and there &apos;s a little bit of meetings , and there &apos;s a little bit of government governance , but it &apos;s not a title .
and that &apos;s why the Senate is against this .
and they said , &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous , you can &apos;t call him a meeting host . &quot;
and this guy has to sign a treaty and a prime minister .
who &apos;s going to take it seriously , if he only had one of these stupid songs , like the federal government host the United Nations ?
and after three weeks of arguments , there was no Senate .
instead of <unk> , they agreed to <unk> on &quot; <unk> , &quot; but they also wanted to be sure that they didn &apos;t agree on this title , because of respect for the civilization @-@ state , whether it &apos;s Democrats or Republicans or Republicans or Democrats , they &apos;re going to be <unk> it , they &apos;re going to get a very dangerous title , not necessarily , &quot; We don &apos;t want to be <unk> . &quot;
now you can see three interesting things in this story .
first of all , it &apos;s my favorite place , and so far all of the data that I can find , the Senate has never been properly recognized by the name of the President .
Barack Obama , the title of &quot; President Obama , &quot; he said , &quot; he still hangs in the Senate , just after waiting for the Senate .
the second thing you can see is that when the United States says that this is just a ad act -- it will last decade .
but the third thing you can see , and it &apos;s a very important thing , and I want you to remember the point , which is that the federal government , the president of the United States , has no status of it , doesn &apos;t it ?
there are more than 5,000 weapons that are held by him , and the largest economy in the world , and a huge number of aircraft and military forces .
reality and history gave this title a noble meaning .
so the Senate won .
they had a great title for their wish .
and the other thing about the Senate , which is kind of a weird title -- oh , it sounds so weird in those days .
but now , do you know how many countries now have a president ?
<unk> .
and that &apos;s because they want their own title to sound like the guy with 5,000 weapons , etc .
so by the end of the Senate , the Senate has lost , because no one has felt annoyed when they &apos;re told they &apos;re now president of the federal government .
and this is a really important lesson , and I think what you can learn , and that &apos;s what I want to leave you with .
politicians <unk> very <unk> and use vocabulary to shape reality , but in fact , the reality is far greater than the reality of words .
thank you very much .
I was walking along the battles on 50 to the battle in <unk> , and when I was 19 , I was an 19 @-@ year @-@ old man in Florida , and a la <unk> <unk> .
I used my black <unk> to replace a brown pair of <unk> , and I looked at the tanks of <unk> government .
this was the first time I went to Afghanistan .
early on in the war , I grew up on a weekend in a friend , watching football , watching a boy with a racism , and a group of religious <unk> shouting , &quot; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; and then in Afghanistan , we don &apos;t even know what that means when the statue is burning .
but that &apos;s how self @-@ formed .
so I stand here today with the blood of Afghanistan , and the way God <unk> me , an atheist and a radical political artist , and I &apos;ve been living in Afghanistan for the last nine years , working and writing .
in Afghanistan , you can show a lot of wonderful things by creating art , but I don &apos;t really want to paint the rainbow , the kinds of behavioral challenges , the kinds of behavioral challenges , the kinds of behavioral challenges that we live in , the moral theories that we live in .
and I wanted to live a day in a decision @-@ making molecule , a day in which he &apos;d beat the <unk> of communism , as the <unk> of the pop star , and use the religious threats and the fire to make himself rich .
these are the <unk> , except for the public election , <unk> : &quot; choose me , choose me ! I &apos;m a <unk> . I &apos;m a <unk> ! &quot; and what can we do ?
and I tried to <unk> out the <unk> of the <unk> , which made up of the national heroes .
I wanted to see the corruption in Afghanistan by a work called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and to use a police officer on the streets of Kabul , to create a fake red line , stop the bribe , instead of giving them money or the police department of Kabul , hoping that they would receive 100 dollars in our name for Afghanistan .
I wanted to know what to do with my perspective , and to explain how conflicts in Afghanistan have become the art of conflict .
and the war and the <unk> of the war created this very style and fashion that was designed by the soldiers and the suicide bombers , and I added a fashion to get the local hairs on the <unk> , and I added a brand new traditional pocket .
and I also wanted to put together a simple Kabul and <unk> <unk> on the wall to see and talk about how modern art can come from the old days of <unk> , what they call &quot; white , &quot; to save the brown skin , or maybe even make it a little bit of a civilization .
but to do that , you might be able to save the prison , and they would be misunderstood .
but I had to do what I had to do , because my ego asked me to do .
that &apos;s the kind of burden I have . what about yours ?
thank you .
Hi , Cameron Russell , a model model model in the last few years .
actually , 10 years .
now , I felt a kind of <unk> in this room because I shouldn &apos;t wear this dress .
and Gene took another set .
this is the first live stage at TED , so I think there &apos;s a lot of fortunate people here .
if there were some women who were right , I didn &apos;t have to tell me that now , but I would Twitter in a minute .
and I want to tell you that I &apos;ve been blessed to be able to change my image in 10 seconds .
that &apos;s not what everybody can do .
and the high @-@ heels are uncomfortable , and the good news was I was not going to wear them .
the worst news is I &apos;m going to take this sweater off the head , because you laugh at me , so when I wear my wear , don &apos;t do anything .
that &apos;s it .
so why do I do this ?
it &apos;s strange .
I don &apos;t want to be that way .
the imagery is powerful , but it &apos;s also powerful .
I just changed my mind in six seconds .
in this photograph , I actually don &apos;t have a boyfriend in real life .
when the photographer had to relax my back , I was very uncomfortable with that guy &apos;s hair .
and sure enough , in addition to surgery , like two days ago , the brown brown brown brown that I did for my job , we basically couldn &apos;t change our appearance , even though it was <unk> , and it had a huge impact on our lives .
so today , for me , the <unk> of change means honesty .
I stand here today because I &apos;m a model model .
and I &apos;m on this stage because I &apos;m a beautiful , white woman , and we call it &quot; sexy girl . &quot;
and I want to answer the question that people often ask me in a very honest way .
the first question is , how do you become models ?
and I always say , &quot; I &apos;m discovered , &quot; but it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
the real reason why I became a model model model model is that I have some really good genes , and I am a <unk> receiver , and you may be asking what legacy is .
well , in the last few centuries , we &apos;ve defined beauty in our definition , not just health , young and small bodies , but the elements of our biological instincts to celebrate , including <unk> , <unk> color , <unk> color , <unk> women , skin <unk> .
that &apos;s my legacy , and that &apos;s the legacy I &apos;ve been making .
I know some of you might have had a bit of a sense of this , and you might have some kind of fashion <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
first of all , I want to give you credit for the model world .
but unfortunately , I have to tell you that in 2007 , a Ph.D. from NYU , was inspired by the number of people who were models in the workforce , and only 27 of them were paid less than four percent .
the next question people ask me was , &quot; Can I grow up as a model ? &quot;
my first answer was , &quot; I don &apos;t know , because they didn &apos;t let me run this . &quot;
but the second answer , which I want to ask , is , &quot; Why ? &quot;
you know what ? you can choose any profession .
you could be the president of the United States , or the inventor of the Internet , or the next generation ninja , which is nice , because you &apos;re the first .
if you listen to them , they say , &quot; No , no , no , I want to be a model model , &quot; and I say , &quot; When my boss . &quot;
because I can &apos;t determine if anything , you can become the CEO of a magazine in the United States , or the next president of <unk> magazine , or Steven Pinker .
when you grow up , you want to be a model , like when you say you &apos;re growing up , you want to win a lottery .
it &apos;s not within your grasp . it &apos;s a great model , but it &apos;s not a plan .
I &apos;m going to show you some of my models for a decade , because it &apos;s not like a traditional French poet , but it &apos;s a real problem .
so if the photographer is here , the lights are right here -- like a beautiful <unk> client who said , &quot; Cameron , I want to walk a shot of a shutter , &quot; which has a long , long tail , has a three @-@ quarters of an arm , and it goes back and forth , and it looks like this , and then it looks at your 400 friends .
it looks like this .
I don &apos;t want to be that way .
I don &apos;t know what it is .
the reality is , when you graduate , you have a résumé , and you have a <unk> job , you can &apos;t say anything else , so if you say you want to be President of the United States , but on your résumé , you smile for 10 years .
the next question people ask is , &quot; Are they <unk> ? &quot;
yes , they almost took photographs , but that &apos;s a small part of the work .
this is the first prototype I ever had , a graphic model , and it was the first time I ever wore my <unk> .
I knew it was a little private , but I was also young .
this was a photograph I took with my grandmother a few months ago .
this is a shot of the day .
my friend and I were there .
this is a photograph I took from a French <unk> in my pajamas a few days ago .
this is a photograph of my team and <unk> .
this is me right now .
what I want you to understand is that these are not my photographs .
they were made by a group of professionals , <unk> , photographers and photographers and their <unk> and their <unk> , and they made these images in <unk> , not me .
the next question is , &quot; Can you get free ? &quot;
I did not have the opportunity to wear eight inches high heels , but the free stuff is what I get in real life , and that &apos;s exactly what we don &apos;t want to talk about .
when I was the mayor of Cambridge , I went into a shop and forgot money , and they sent me a dress .
when I was teenagers , I was driving along with my friends , and she was a terrible driver , and we had red traffic lights , and I just said , &quot; Sorry , we &apos;re on the road .
and I got this because my appearance wasn &apos;t me . some people paid for their appearance instead of identity .
I live in New York , and there were 14 million young men who were parking lot in the last year , 86 percent of them black and Latino , mostly young boys .
whereas in New York , young black and Latino men , there are only 1.3 million men in Latin America , so the question is , &quot; Am I going to stop ? &quot;
it was , &quot; I &apos;m going to stop a few times ? when will I stop ? &quot;
and when I did this research , I found that in the 13 @-@ year @-@ old girls in the United States did not like their bodies to 17 , and that ratio went up to 78 percent .
so the last question is , &quot; What does a model feel like ? &quot;
and I guess the answer that they &apos;re expecting is , &quot; If you &apos;re a bit thinner , there &apos;s some <unk> in your hair , you &apos;re happier , it &apos;s unbelievable . &quot;
when we come back , we give a answer like this .
we said , &quot; Look , you can travel around and be creative , passionate , inspiring people working together . &quot;
and it &apos;s only half the truth , but it &apos;s only half the fact that we &apos;re never going to say before the camera is , I &apos;m never going to say , &quot; I &apos;m not safe . &quot;
because I had to worry about what I looked like every day .
if you &apos;ve ever wondered , would I be happier if my thigh was thinner ?
you just have to look at models and see that because they have the most thin coat of their legs , the beautiful hair , the coolest clothes , and they &apos;re probably the most insecure woman in the world .
so when I prepared for this talk , it &apos;s hard to find a sense of balance , because if I stand here and say , &quot; Look , I &apos;ve got so much pleasure out of nature &apos;s advantage , &quot; but it &apos;s uncomfortable to say , &quot; But it &apos;s not fun . &quot;
but the hardest part of all is to show you gender and racism , because I am the most <unk> .
but at the same time , I was very happy and respected , and I was also young , not working for 10 , 20 , 30 years and models , and I couldn &apos;t get the most accurate sense of what my first job was like .
and if this gave you a little bit of benefit , I hope , is that we can all embrace the power of imagery , the success and the failures that we understand .
thank you .
today I only want one thing .
don &apos;t say I &apos;m sane .
I want to introduce you to my two brothers .
he &apos;s 22 years old this year .
he didn &apos;t speak , but he was able to convey pleasure in his own home in a very particular way .
he knows what love is .
and he would not share that .
he doesn &apos;t care what other people are .
he didn &apos;t care about religion , and he said , &quot; He never did . &quot;
and when he &apos;d written out of our childhood <unk> , even as I &apos;ve forgotten , he reminded me that we know so much about the spirit and the unknown things are so fascinating .
and this year &apos;s 16 , and it &apos;s also pretty hot .
he had this extraordinary memory .
but the memory is selective .
he didn &apos;t remember stealing my chocolate , but remember when I was released from the iPod when I was four years old , and we were talking about <unk> <unk> on my arm , and there was a Lady Gaga <unk> .
sounds pretty incredible , right ?
but a lot of people don &apos;t think that way .
and the truth is , because their minds don &apos;t match the normal people &apos;s definition , they &apos;re often isolated , <unk> .
but what blew my mind was that even though they were not seen as normal people , it was just one thing that they were remarkable , even though they were having autism .
some of you may not know too much about it , but it &apos;s a term called autism , and it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that causes a social disorders of social disorders , sometimes sports dysfunction .
every single one of these cases is unique , so it &apos;s different from Sam .
in the world , every 20 minutes , there &apos;s a new diagnosis of autism , and yet this is one of the fastest growing diseases of the world , but we don &apos;t know why it &apos;s so well being treated .
and I knew for the first time that &quot; autism &quot; happened in the word , and I had one day that I knew nothing about autism .
when I was three , my brother was born , and I was so excited that I had a new family .
and just a few months later , I realized he was different .
he was screaming .
he didn &apos;t want to play like any other baby , and in fact he wasn &apos;t interested in me .
he was immersed in his own world , using his own principles , looking for pleasure in things like <unk> around the room , looking at the washing machine and the washing machine and the washing machine .
as he grew up , he became more unique in these special places .
and one of the things that &apos;s unique about this experience , besides the usual suspects , is that he doesn &apos;t look at the world , he &apos;s a person who never lied to .
it &apos;s not easy .
I couldn &apos;t deny the family that there was a tough time , and I thought they were like me .
but then I moved to what they taught me about personality , communication and love , and I realized that these things I didn &apos;t want to be normal .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with the difference between normal people and the individual .
it &apos;s just that there are different kinds of things .
I just want to say one sentence , which is that you don &apos;t have to be normal for Sam .
you can be extraordinary .
whether it &apos;s autism or not there &apos;s a difference between us -- every one of us has a gift , honestly , &quot; <unk> &quot; -- that is to kill the potential .
the possibility of transcendence , progress and change is that we want to disappear from one another .
please don &apos;t say I &apos;m normal . &quot;
thank you .
Dr. <unk> took the photographs of this bullet , and we admire and curiosity , and this photograph was only one in a million seconds .
but now , 50 years later , we can shoot a million times faster , not just in a one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ million @-@ a @-@ million @-@ a @-@ million @-@ second , but one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half a @-@ trillion @-@ a @-@ second gear .
now I &apos;m going to show you a new kind of camera technology called the <unk> imaging , which is a technology that has gotten so quickly that it can capture light .
so with this technology , we can make cameras out of the corners of the light , we can see beyond the horizon , or we can &apos;t use X @-@ rays of our bodies , and the camera challenges our definition of the camera .
now , if I use a laser pen , and within one trillion seconds a turn -- that &apos;s a couple of times -- I &apos;m going to create some photons , all these photons are <unk> wide , and these photons are just like a bullet , and they &apos;re going to get a million times the speed of light .
now , what if you put the bullet in the bottle , what would these photons do ?
what &apos;s the slow speed of light ?
now , the whole thing .
now remember , remember , this whole thing happened within a single ship -- the <unk> time -- but now I slowed down the video a million times in the movement .
but Coke doesn &apos;t fund it .
now , there &apos;s a lot of things going on here , so let me give you a demonstration .
now , the beam of light goes into the bottle , which is our bullet , goes through the bottle , and puts it inside .
some of them came out , and on the table , you start to see the pattern .
a lot of photons eventually get to the caps and go all the way around .
and as you can see , here &apos;s an air tank that <unk> inside .
and at the same time , the waves go to the table , and because of the reflection on the top of the bottle , you can see that after the bottle &apos;s bottom , the reflected back .
now , if you walk the same distance with a regular bullet , you slow it down with a million times , do you know how long you &apos;re waiting to see this process ?
one day , a week ? actually , a year .
and this , of course , is boring , regular bullet points .
but what about some of these ?
you can see the pattern over and over again on the table , with tomato and wall .
it &apos;s like throwing a rock in a tank .
and I think that &apos;s how nature builds tomatoes , <unk> , but of course what we see in the eye is the combination of the whole .
but if you look at this tomatoes , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> is on the tomato , it &apos;s shining all the time . it &apos;s not dark .
why ? because tomatoes are familiar , and they &apos;re reflected inside of the tomatoes , and they &apos;re coming out after a thousand seconds .
so in the future , when imaging cameras are in your cell phone , you can go to a mall , and you can check your fruit .
so what did I do at MIT &apos;s team ?
now , as a photographer , you know , if you want to wear a film , you only have a little bit of light , but we &apos;re going to need a million times faster than we are , so you don &apos;t get any light .
so what we did was , we changed the photons and we repeated them all over and over again , and a million times , and then every time it &apos;s wonderful , and then from a few data points of data , we actually created a picture , and this is what you saw .
and we take all of that raw data and add it to it , and it &apos;s fun to do it .
now , Superman can fly .
some other heroes could disappear , but imagine a future hero : he could see things underneath .
and the idea is that we can put some of the door over the door .
and these lights reflect into the room , and some of them go back to the door and go into the camera , and then we can use those optical reflection .
that &apos;s not true . we did .
on the left , you see our camera imaging cameras .
there &apos;s a wall behind the wall , and we &apos;re going to do a lot of things .
so , in our paper , we published this in &quot; Nature , &quot; which was recommend the Queen of nature , and they created this animation .
we &apos;re going to launch these bullets , and they &apos;re going to hit the wall , and because the light is going to go in all directions , some of them will end up beating into our hidden <unk> , and they will continue to know that the door will reflects some light , and some of the light will come back to the camera , but they will end up in different times .
and because we have a camera that can run so fast , that &apos;s our camera camera , and that camera has a specific capability .
it has good time resolution , and it can capture the world at the speed of light .
so , not only do we know where the camera gate is , but we know where the distance is , but we don &apos;t know which distance .
by using a laser , we can record an original photograph , which you see on the screen , which is kind of meaningless , but then we can take a lot of pictures , put them together , and then analyze the reflection , can we see the hidden object here ?
can we look at the <unk> ?
that &apos;s our model .
now , we &apos;re putting them in the field , and we &apos;re going to have a couple of them going in the future , but in the future , we can put this technology in the car so that we can avoid collisions , because they can see , or we can look at survivors in the window , or we can look at the device , or we can see the device in the eye of the device , or the device .
but of course , because of the <unk> of organizations and blood , it &apos;s quite difficult , so we call scientists to really value the science of <unk> , treating this as a new model for solving the next generation of health .
now , like Dr. Love , a scientist , science has become art , a high @-@ speed <unk> , and I realize that every time we collect lots of data , not just science imaging , but a new kind of <unk> photography , this technology has <unk> and color code , and we just remember that pattern in just a few seconds .
but something interesting is happening .
when you see the pattern of the lid of the lid , they &apos;re moving away .
but they should move us .
what happened ?
and as a result , since we &apos;re <unk> these things at the speed of light , we have these strange phenomena , and Einstein &apos;s happy to see these pictures .
the sequence of events is sometimes turned into the camera , so we can change the sequence of time and space over time .
so whether you look at the corner , whether it &apos;s making a healthy video for the next generation , or whether it &apos;s growing a new visualization , and since our invention , we &apos;ve put all of that information and the details online , and we hope that this group , this creative research group , can tell us that we shouldn &apos;t get into the next big picture .
it &apos;s about time . thank you .
this is where I live , Kenya , in the southern part of Nairobi National Park .
behind me , my father &apos;s cows in the back of the cow was in Nairobi National Park .
the southern part of the National Park , there are no booms at all , and that means that wildlife like zebras can move outside the park .
so predators like lions follow their behavior .
they killed our livestock .
and this is one of the cows that was killed at night , and I found it dead in the morning , and I was feeling it , because it was the only cow that I had .
our <unk> believed that we were bringing our animals and our home from heaven to dung , to live , that &apos;s why we value them .
so I became very interested in lions .
the families and the birds were protecting our families and our livestock , but they were also depressed about the problem , and they were frustrated .
so they decided to killed the lions .
this is one of six lions killed in Nairobi National Park .
and I think that &apos;s the reason why Nairobi parks are so small .
in our family , there are six to @-@ nine @-@ year @-@ olds who are trying to protect their fathers , the same cause happens to me .
so I had to find a solution .
the first way I thought about it was to use fire , because I knew that lions feared fire .
but I realized that it didn &apos;t work , it didn &apos;t help the lion to see our <unk> .
but I didn &apos;t give up . I was quiet .
so there &apos;s a second way : use the grass .
I wanted to cheat the lion to get them right next to me .
but lions are very clever .
and the first day they came , and they went back , but the next day , they would come back and say , &quot; This thing has never happened , and he stayed here . &quot;
and so they <unk> and killed the animals .
and one night , I was walking around with my flashlight , and the lions didn &apos;t come .
and I started to realize that lions tend to fear movement .
so I had an idea .
because I was a kid , and I could just spend a whole day and a half , and one day in my own room , I even <unk> my mom &apos;s <unk> radio , and she almost killed me on that day , but I learned a lot about electronics .
so I found an old <unk> , an assessment . this is a small gear from a motorcycle that was able to control the light from a motorcycle .
and at the same time , I found a switch that I could control the light of the lights .
the light bulb came from a broken flashlight .
everything was ready .
and as you can see , the solar pressure picks up the battery , and then it sends the clues to the source energy , I call this &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and then it turns out that it <unk> light .
and as you can see , the light bulb was <unk> , because lions come from there .
and what you see when the lion comes up at night is this .
and this light would actually fire the lion to get the lion to get the idea that I would walk around the river , but in fact , at this point I was doing a big job in my bed .
thank you .
I had put this in my home two years ago , and since then , we had no herd of <unk> .
my neighbors had heard about it .
one of them was this grandmother .
and she had a whole pile of birds that were hunted to be killed , and she asked if I could help her to have a light at home .
I couldn &apos;t afford it .
I have these lights , and as you can see behind , these are the <unk> .
and so far , I &apos;ve been working on this issue of <unk> in our families , and they &apos;re very useful .
now , my approach has been used for everybody in Kenya to avoid other predatory animals , like hyena , and the leopard was also used to protect the elephant from the farm .
and I was also very lucky to get a scholarship because of this invention , this is one of the best schools in Kenya -- one of the most exciting schools in the world .
my new school now comes in and helps me raise my fame and raise more money .
I even brought my friends back to my community , helping them to install this in people without <unk> .
a year ago , I was just a normal kid in the savanna to help his dad , and I used to look at the plane , and tell myself , one day , I &apos;ll be inside .
today , I did .
I got an opportunity to come to TED . this is my first time .
so my great dream is : when I grew up , I became an airplane engineer and a pilot .
I used to hate lions , but now , because of my invention , I saved my father &apos;s cattle and we were finally able to get lions alive .
thank you very much . in my language , what it means : thank you very much .
you don &apos;t believe how inspiring your story is .
so you &apos;ve got this scholarship . Richard Wurman : yes .
are you doing another electron ?
what &apos;s your next project ?
next invention : my next invention is , I want to make an electric bar .
Di : I know , the electricity booms already have , but I just want to make my own one .
you &apos;ve tried it one time , right , but you -- <unk> : I &apos;ve tried it , but I stopped it , because it <unk> me .
it would be a mystery . Richard <unk> , you &apos;re different .
we &apos;re going to do every step you &apos;re growing up , friends .
thank you very much . <unk> : thank you .
I live in Los Angeles .
this is L.A. <unk> : <unk> , fast food restaurants , <unk> land .
so the planners of the city sit together and talk about what it means to take Los Angeles to make a difference , so they changed it to Southern Los Angeles , as if it &apos;s going to solve the real problem .
this is Los Angeles .
hotels , food restaurants , all over the place .
and like about 200 million other Americans , I live in the desert of food , and Los Angeles is a business model for <unk> , where consumers don &apos;t have to get out of their car .
and the interesting thing about this is that there are more flying cars that kill them .
in Los Angeles , people died in a cure .
for example , the reason why I live in a block is less than five times the size of our block , maybe eight times .
I was tired of the reality .
and at the same time , if there &apos;s no way to get healthy food , what do you feel if you come out of your home and see the food systems in your neighborhood , what do you feel ?
I see a wheelchair as a <unk> vehicle .
I see the <unk> Center like Starbucks .
I don &apos;t want to go there .
and I think the answer has been hidden in the question .
food is a problem , and food is a solution .
add that up to that , I &apos;m tired of taking a 45 @-@ minute trip and buying an apple that didn &apos;t go back .
so what I did was I put food in my house .
it &apos;s in what we call <unk> .
150 feet by 10 feet .
<unk> are all over the government .
but people always need to maintain it .
so I thought , &quot; Great ! this is my responsibility , I have to maintain it , so I want to do something . &quot;
that &apos;s why I maintain it .
so my team and I , &quot; L.A. &quot; came together , and we started growing our own food forests , and we had a whole variety of vegetables .
we are a free @-@ governmental organization , made up of different governments , volunteers , and we &apos;re all volunteers , and we &apos;re all making a duty .
the garden was beautiful .
but soon somebody complained .
and the government accused me , and I had to take away my garden and turn it into a warning .
and I was like , &quot; What , come on ?
no one cared about this land in a small patch of land .
and I thought , &quot; Wow , that &apos;s it . &quot;
because it didn &apos;t happen .
so the Los Angeles Times ran , and Steve <unk> wrote a story about it , and we talked to parties , and a community of green people , and they uploaded it to <unk> , and they collected 900 signed , and we succeeded .
we &apos;re successful with our hands .
and even the legislators came to visit , and it was so admired that he had done it .
I mean , of course , how can they not do that ?
the number of empty spaces in Los Angeles had in the United States .
it has 26 square kilometers of empty space .
that &apos;s 20 Central Park .
there are enough spaces to grow 250 million species of tomato sauce .
why do they feel so bad ?
a single tree can get 1,000 , maybe a hundred .
a dollar can produce 75 dollars for you .
this is my motto , and I tell people , grow your own food .
it &apos;s like a <unk> .
see , I had legacy in Los Angeles .
I grew up there , and I raised my son there .
I refused to be a part of the reality that someone made me create .
see , I &apos;m an artist .
the work of the gardening is that I create my own art .
it &apos;s like the graffiti artist , <unk> the wall , and I , <unk> the lawn .
I looked at the garden and the land as canvas , and plants and trees are decorated on the canvas .
you would be shocked to do what land could do if you looked at it as your canvas .
you can &apos;t imagine how amazing it is , and what it will do to people .
what happens ?
I saw my garden change in my garden .
to change the community , you have to change the nature of the soil .
we are soil .
you are shocked by how children are affected .
the gardening movement is the most healthy and challenging activity , especially in the inner city .
plus you can get strawberries .
and I remember one day , a mom and daughter came out of nowhere in the background of about 10 p.m. , and when I came out , they were embarrassed .
their presence made me feel dreadful , and I told them , you don &apos;t have to take food like this .
this is the reason why it &apos;s on the street .
and when I saw the people beside me , it was a shame . it made me feel ashamed . it raised my determination to make food . people ask me , &quot; Are you stealing ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; No , of course , I &apos;m sure people will steal it .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
that &apos;s what I want .
I want people to take it , but at the same time , I want people to be healthy . &quot;
and one of the other things that happened when I was in downtown Los Angeles to have a garden .
the boys helped me figure out what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s cool . they shared stories about how the garden affects them , and how they shared with their mothers and their grandmother , seeing that the garden can change the way they are .
green spaces then started <unk> maybe 20 gardens .
we already have about 50 people involved in our team , all volunteers .
if kids grow food , kids eat food .
if they plant their tomato , they eat the tomato .
but when these kids are not present in front of their eyes , if they don &apos;t realize how food affects people &apos;s thoughts and bodies , they just eat food in front of them .
I saw young people who wanted to work , but they were very happy to spend time with this , and I saw kids in different colors , and they were always <unk> on the way they were designed for them , and there was a road .
and as the gardening campaign , I found an opportunity to train these kids to take over their communities , to live a sustainable life .
when we do that , who knows if we will .
next George Washington .
but if we don &apos;t change the nature of the soil , we will never .
this led to one of my current plans . this is what I want to do .
and I wanted a whole neighborhood garden of gardens , where people could share food .
I wanted to turn the shipping container into a healthy ship .
don &apos;t get me wrong .
I didn &apos;t think for free , because free is not sustainable .
and the reason for sustainability is that you have to maintain it .
what I &apos;m talking about is getting people to work , to get kids out of the street , to get them to know about their joy , their honor , their pride , the pride , the open farmers market .
so what I wanted to do was to make the project more attractive .
I want us to be the president of the environmental revolution , the rogue , the <unk> .
we &apos;re going to make a rogue .
if you &apos;re not a <unk> , you &apos;re not a rogue .
who &apos;s got a <unk> rogue ?
let alone become the weapons of your choice .
basically , if you want to meet me , if you want to meet , if you want to be in a comfortable seat with something that doesn &apos;t even call me .
and if you want to think about me , just take the garden and come to the garden , then we can just pull things off .
thank you .
thank you .
before March 2011 , I was a photographer of <unk> , New York .
we didn &apos;t want to go and buy it .
we live in a room of pitch , <unk> , no windows , basically for the sun .
we were able to take a model that was thinner , to make the skin <unk> better , to make the impossible possible , and we were always criticized by media , but we were actually brilliant artists , experienced by images and photographs .
on March 11th , 2011 , like everyone around the world , I saw the tragedy of Japan at home .
soon after that , I participated in a group of volunteers , &quot; <unk> &quot; teams of volunteers , just within a few days , in local emergency rescue .
I and other volunteers knew that we couldn &apos;t afford to be at home , and so I decided to join them and volunteer for three weeks .
on May 13 , I came to Japan .
that &apos;s a small fishing village in Japan , where only 50,000 people were , and that &apos;s where they were victims of disasters .
the tsunami was over 24 meters , and it landed about two miles .
and as you can imagine , this little town was suffering .
and we came out of that rubble and into the <unk> .
we &apos;re helping schools and the lost homes to clean up , to rebuild , to rebuild .
we cleaned up a lot of <unk> , <unk> fish , which were all local factories and processed fish .
and we all became very dirty and <unk> , but we were very upset .
and within weeks , all the volunteers and the local people found something like this .
and they kept finding photos and photos and cameras and <unk> .
everybody &apos;s responding and act like this .
they collected them , collected them , took them to take care of each other .
and it wasn &apos;t until now that I realized that there was a big part of the lost .
and when they were attacked by the tsunami , you had to think , you know , the <unk> , the natural world , and put everything in their hands .
and I spent the last week in Japan , and I found myself in a place where I was working for a <unk> .
help a <unk> clean ground .
it happened to be a place where the <unk> were collecting pictures of people .
people were taking photographs and sending them to that <unk> , and I was very privileged to get their trust , to get me to clean , to get back to the photos .
and it was a very inspiring moment , and I &apos;ve been listening to people and saying , &quot; Be creative , until cleaning those photographs , &quot; I &apos;ve actually done what &apos;s called innovation . &quot;
and when I look at those pictures , there are perhaps more or more than a hundred years of history , and some of them are still saved in the lab , and I thought from a single point of view , maybe I can help them repair the photos of the <unk> and the <unk> , and I also know that a lot of people will come back .
so on that evening , I went to Facebook and I asked some friends , and in the morning , there was a lot of news , and there was a lot of news , and I said they were willing to help .
so we started <unk> .
this is the first shot .
it wasn &apos;t a hell of a lot of damage , but it was a place where there was a girl &apos;s face , and we had to repair it , and we had to do it very precisely .
otherwise , a little girl &apos;s face doesn &apos;t look like her face -- a tragedy or a tragedy , just like a picture .
and over time , more and more of these photographs have been taken , and we also had to have more and more of them to deal with these pictures , so I went back to Facebook and professional links to find help , just five days , and they came from 12 different countries .
within two weeks , I got 150 volunteers and they were willing to join us .
and by the way , only in Japan , we &apos;ve set up a small tree of <unk> that has <unk> between the north and the south .
every week , we scanning devices in the temporary form , and people come and pictures of themselves .
sometimes , some older women have never seen a scanner , and after they &apos;ve found their own picture , within 10 minutes , they can scan it , and then upload it to the cloud , and then upload it to a non @-@ Japanese or strangers , they may come from one side of the Earth .
however , at that time , when they took the pictures back , the time was completely different , and of course , it had to do with the damage .
maybe an hour to repair it , and maybe a couple of weeks .
maybe a few months .
and the beauty of the photograph has to be processed by hand , or by inch , or by inch , the colors of the fold , and processing the details that are not covered by water .
the process is very much time .
and all of these photographs of the tsunami that were <unk> in the saltwater , <unk> of the bacteria , <unk> in the garbage , sometimes covered in the <unk> , all of these photographs that were continuing to destroy these photographs , and therefore a significant part of this project .
and if these photographs don &apos;t get clean , we can &apos;t fix them , and before they get dry , they have to dry up .
our hand @-@ washing activity is very good .
there &apos;s a woman who <unk> us .
and these pictures are very easy to fail again .
as the captain of my team once said , it &apos;s like doing tattoos .
you can &apos;t make a mess , otherwise it will make a mess .
the woman who gave us these photographs was very lucky , and in this photograph .
and she started washing her pictures , until she realized she had actually made more damage to the photograph .
okay , there &apos;s a copy of her photo .
otherwise , in this photograph , she and her face would not be completely fixed , and we were able to put all the parts together into a good photo and then re @-@ <unk> this photo .
and when she got this photograph from us , she shared a story with us .
and what she found was that these photographs were actually found by her husband &apos;s colleague , and after the local fire brigade forces were actually very far away from her house , they recognized him .
and the day of the tsunami , he was making sure the tsunami is closed .
an alarm goes on , and he has to be on the front lines .
her two sons , though , were too big , were also in two different schools .
one of the kids was shocked by the tsunami .
she took a whole week to get back to her family , and they were all alone .
and the day after that came back , we were on the 14th birthday of her son .
and for her , despite the extraordinary tragedy and all of that , it was the best gift that the son had given his son , the photographs that allowed him to <unk> , to remember , to remember , that it was no longer a day in March , when all of his life changed , or were killed .
six months after Japan stayed alone in six months , there were one million volunteers , one hundred volunteers , one hundred volunteers , and many hundreds of other things that we can do to help us clean up more than 15 million photos .
and most of it ends up in the back pocket , and it &apos;s important .
more than 500 volunteers around the world have given us a photo of 90 families , and these photographs have been reconstructed , <unk> .
and during that time , we didn &apos;t spend $ <unk> on devices or materials , and most of it was done with printers .
we take pictures .
it &apos;s a photo of a remind and a reminder that some of us , some things , some place , a feeling , a love person .
they &apos;re helping us record , remembering memories and our past , the most vulnerable moments of emergency moments , but sometimes we &apos;re left to get back .
that &apos;s the whole project , all of it , to restore the little pieces of human nature , to save people from the past .
and when a photo came back to its owner , it would bring a huge difference , and it would make a difference in the lifestyle .
and this project also changed our frustration .
and for some <unk> , this experience set up a couple of connections , connecting with some greater things , such as social feedback , testing their talents , not only for models , but for the perfect skin .
and I want to conclude by reading an email from the end , I get a letter from <unk> , six months later from Japan .
and when I was repaired with those photographs , I was reminded of the stories that each of them and the photographs were uploaded .
and in particular , a woman who took photographs of her , and went to grandmother , and went to a little girl , and there was a catch , because there was a picture of my house , my grandmother , my mother , my daughter , my daughter , in my house .
across the globe , beyond age limit , we have some of the most fundamental needs of the world , right ? &quot;
thank you .
today , I &apos;d like to talk about a disturbing question , and the answer to that question also <unk> .
I &apos;m going to talk about the secret of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to answer is , &quot; Why is she staying ? &quot;
&quot; why would someone want to live with her men ? &quot;
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker , a social worker .
I &apos;m just a woman who has a personal story .
I was 22 years old . I had just graduated from Harvard College .
I moved to New York , and I started my own first job as a magazine magazine and a <unk> .
I had my first house , and I had a credit card . I had a very big secret .
and the secret was that I had been struck by the man that I thought was my soul using this to fill out a hollow of a hollow gun with a lot of guns , a lot of times .
this man that I had always loved , pointed at my head and threatened to kill me , and I never remembered how many times I had done .
now this crazy story I &apos;ve told you about romantic love is a psychological trap of love , a millions of women every year , and even some men fall into this trap .
maybe it &apos;s happening to you .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic victim .
I had a college degree of English education at Harvard University , and I got an MBA degree in the business market .
and the reason why most of the time is working for Fortune 500 companies , including Wikipedia , and the Washington Post .
I married my husband for almost 20 years with three children .
there was a black <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s the first fact that I want to tell you about this : that domestic violence may not happen to everybody , not your ethnic , belief , income and education .
it &apos;s everywhere .
the second fact that I want to tell you about this is that many people think that if domestic violence happens to women , it should be women &apos;s issues .
no .
over 85 percent of the <unk> are men , and women are only happening in intimacy , in a long @-@ term relationship , in other words , in families , and this is one of the most reluctant to see violence . this is one of the reasons why it &apos;s called domestic violence .
I thought there were only one person in the world who would continue to stay with my man , but it was actually very common in my age .
I was 22 years old . whereas in the United States , 16 to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds were more likely to be killed by more women than any other woman in the United States , and in the United States , more than five women or boys were killed every year , or their husband .
I &apos;m a very typical victim , and I know nothing about my own domestic violence and development .
I met <unk> in a <unk> , and it was January , freezing .
we sat around on the subway in New York , and he talked to me .
he told me two things .
the first one was he graduated from Connecticut school , and worked in a very good Wall Street bank .
but the first thing that happened to me was his wisdom and humor , and he looked like a farm boy .
his face looked like a giant wheat <unk> in the palm of the wheat , and it looked like a giant <unk> .
one of the most brilliant things that happened to me in the first few days is to convince me that I was a tough one .
and at the beginning , he made me feel that I was an icon of his worship .
and we started working with him , and he liked everything about me , like my brilliant , and I was at Harvard &apos;s School , and I was giving them a voice for teenagers and my work .
he wanted to know my family , my childhood , my wish and my dreams .
as a woman and a <unk> , I had never been there before .
and he made this incredible spirit of trust , through the secret of his unknown secrets , he told me that he begins his four @-@ year @-@ olds , and <unk> him on the body , and the result of this abuse , that he had to drop out in eighth grade , even though he had a brilliant life .
and that &apos;s why the degrees of Wall Street , the work of Wall Street and the bright possibilities for him .
and if somebody says to me that this is smart , humor and <unk> and love my man will have a day to tell if I wear makeup , my skirt will live in a short way , and I live in a position where to be friends , where Christmas and where you are , I will laugh at you , because I don &apos;t see the violence or the violence .
and I didn &apos;t know that , <unk> and <unk> were the first step of the domestic violence .
and I didn &apos;t know that the next step was a victim .
and the Russians are not coming home and saying to me , &quot; Hey , you know , they &apos;re great , but we &apos;re going to get into the next phase of this , and I &apos;m going to abuse you . &quot; so I want you to leave your own apartment , preventing your neighbors , and I &apos;m going to let you leave the city and their friends . &quot;
and the truth is , he came home at a Friday night and told me he quit his job , and he said he couldn &apos;t quit his job , because I quit his job , and he said he had such an incredible happiness and safety , and he didn &apos;t have to prove that he didn &apos;t have to go to a Wall Street wall , and now he didn &apos;t want to leave the city as a role of mine in New England .
and what I didn &apos;t want to do was leave New York and leave my passionate work , but for my own soul , I thought I needed to make a sacrifice . so I agreed to quit my job and leave Manhattan with the <unk> .
I thought I &apos;d come into this crazy romantic love and I didn &apos;t know I &apos;d walked into a elaborate <unk> control of your body , your body and your economy .
and the third phase of the domestic violence is to begin to look at her response .
that &apos;s what the gun used .
we just moved to the New England town -- and I think the <unk> should be safe here -- he bought a gun .
and one of them was put in a van .
a pillow underneath the bed , the window is still in your pocket .
he said that a traumatic event would cause him to have these guns .
let him stay safe .
the gun was an obvious signal for me , even though he didn &apos;t pick a dot to me , I was already on the verge of not danger .
and the first night I beat and hit on my wedding night .
and that was the morning <unk> , and I was wearing <unk> .
I &apos;m working with the computer , and I &apos;m trying to get the full @-@ blown tasks , and I was sort of <unk> , <unk> my excuse for being my neck , with my hands , my neck @-@ up , so I can &apos;t breathe , calling out . he took my neck as a hit .
and then five days later , 10 fingers on my neck went off , and I put on my mom &apos;s <unk> and married him .
and despite all that , I still believe that we can live happily because we love it .
he expressed his depth .
he just got too much stress , and the wedding <unk> and the family knocked him off .
this was an accident , and he wouldn &apos;t hurt me anymore .
I was struck twice as soon as I was .
for the first time , I was going to look for the secret beach , and I was lost , and he <unk> my head on the front wheel so much that it would take me to the front door of the wheel .
on the way to get home to the car , on the way to get home from the car , he <unk> a cold Big Mac in my face .
in the two and a half years of <unk> , I was beaten twice a week .
I had always had this accident that one of my people had .
in fact , one out of three American women has been a victim of domestic violence or hidden goals , and according to the fact that there are 1.5 million children who suffer every year , 15 million children .
so in fact , I &apos;m not alone .
back to my question : why am I staying ?
and the answer is simple .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
and even though he pointed to my head with the gun @-@ <unk> , he pushed me over , beating my dog , threatening our dog , on the freeway , and when I was preparing for the job interview , I had never thought of being a abuse of my wife .
instead , I &apos;m a very strong woman in love with this troubled man , and I am the only person in the world who can help but not meet .
the other question everybody wanted to ask was , why didn &apos;t she leave ?
why didn &apos;t I flee ? I had a lot of opportunities .
for me , it &apos;s the most sad and painful question that people ask me , you can &apos;t understand , but only our victims know how dangerous it is to leave the <unk> themselves .
because the last step in domestic violence is to kill her .
more than 70 percent of the domestic violence occurs after the victim ends of this , because the perpetrator has left behind .
other possible results include long @-@ term tracking , or even <unk> , or <unk> @-@ denial support , <unk> family court to catch the victim and her child , and children often get asked to spend a time with the judge on their mother .
now we still ask , why don &apos;t she flee ?
and the reason I decided to leave was because of the last brutal beating that I could afford .
and I realized that if I didn &apos;t resist , this guy that I used to love to kill me .
so I broke my silence .
and I went to all of you to the police , neighbors , my friends and family , totally strange people , and I can stand here today because you &apos;ve helped me .
we tend to identify victims as &quot; <unk> , &quot; women , like the terrible title in the news .
&quot; why is she leaving ? &quot;
some of them were actually saying , &quot; This is her own mistake , &quot; as if the victim is intentionally and intended to <unk> their men in love .
but after the book came out , a lot of men and women told me their stories , and they wanted to tell people about what they learned from happening , and they started living their lives -- happy families , happy families , mothers and mothers , as I now live in violent situations .
in fact , I &apos;m a typical domestic victim , a typical domestic warrior .
I got married with a very soft man , three children .
there was a black <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> van .
and what I will never have again , always a mouth that says love has a gun pointed at my head .
and you &apos;re probably thinking right now , wow , that &apos;s amazing , or , &quot; Oh , she &apos;s amazing , &quot; but in the process , I &apos;m actually talking about you .
I promise you , there are now people who are listening to me now who are suffering from abuse or abuse or abuse or you &apos;ve been tortured or you &apos;re a <unk> .
abuse may be happening to your daughter , in your sister , in your best friends .
the story of my own love is to break silence .
I &apos;m still losing my silence today .
this is the way I help other victims , and I want to leave you with my final request .
tell someone you &apos;ve heard today .
torture was only in silence .
you have the ability to stop the violence alone needs light .
we are victims of every human being .
we need each of you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
with your kids , your colleagues , your friends and family , talk about this topic , taking out light .
help survivors reclaim this wonderful , cute self , and reclaim the future .
finding the cure for domestic violence and taking care of the potential of reducing it , providing the victims a safe answer .
let &apos;s face it , let &apos;s take our beds , our dining room and our family and our families become the safe , peaceful oasis .
thank you .
when I was a child , I thought my country was the best in the world , and after a while I was a kid called <unk> .
I felt very proud .
in schools , we spend a lot of time learning history , but we never knew anything about the world outside , except that American , Korea and Japanese were enemies .
and although I always wanted to think about the outside world , I thought I would spend my life in North Korea until all of a sudden everything changed .
when I was seven years old , I first witnessed public execution , but I thought I was living in North Korea .
my family wasn &apos;t poor . and for myself , I had never experienced starvation .
but one day in 1995 , my mom took a letter from her sister &apos;s sisters .
and it says , &quot; When you read the letters , all five of my family &apos;s died because we hadn &apos;t eaten for two weeks .
we &apos;re lying on the floor right now , and our bodies are so robust , ready to die . &quot;
and I was shocked .
that was the first time I &apos;d ever heard that people in my country were suffering .
and shortly after that , when I walk through a train station , I see a very painful thing that makes me smile .
a dying woman lies on the ground , holding a sick child , and the child was desperate to hold his mother &apos;s face .
but nobody helped them , because they couldn &apos;t afford their families .
North Korea , in the mid- &apos; 90s , had a terrible famine .
unfortunately , over a million North Koreans died in famine , and a lot of survivor was eating grass , <unk> and <unk> .
the power is becoming more and more frequently , all around me at night , everything around me becomes pitch black , and the lights of my home just through my own river .
and I often wonder why they have <unk> and we don &apos;t .
this is a satellite photograph of North Korea and <unk> at night .
this is <unk> , as part of the border between China and North Korea .
as you can see , the river is very , very narrow in some places , and North Koreans can walk to China .
but a lot of people died .
sometimes I see the body in the water .
I couldn &apos;t disclose the details that I left North Korea , but I could only say that it was the toughest years of famine , and I was sent to China and relatives .
and I thought , I was just separated from my family for a very short time .
but I had no idea that we were there for 14 years .
in China , I was struggling as a young girl .
I had no idea what it would be like to be a refugee of North Korea , but I quickly realized that it was a very difficult life , not only because North Korea was seen as illegal immigrants in China .
so I was always living in fear , and I was afraid that my identity would be detected , and I would send it back to North Korea , and I would receive a terrible destiny .
one day , my worst nightmares came true , and I was grabbed by the Chinese police officer and taken the police station for the police .
there were people who were saying I was North Koreans , so the police tested my Mandarin skills and asked me a lot of questions .
and I was very scared , and I was feeling that my heart was speeding up .
if there &apos;s any signal , I will go to prison and send it back .
and I thought I &apos;d finished my life , and still trying to hide my own fears and panic and answer their questions .
after that , a cop says to another person , &quot; paper is wrong .
she &apos;s not North Koreans . &quot;
and they put me in . it &apos;s a miracle .
some North Koreans were seeking asylum in China to the foreign embassy , but a lot of them were arrested by the Chinese police , sent back to North Korea .
the girls were lucky .
and despite the fact that they were caught , there was a huge international competition that they were ultimately released .
but there are also some North Koreans that are not so lucky .
every year , thousands of North Koreans were arrested in China and sent it back to North Korea , and they were <unk> or executed .
and while I was lucky enough to leave North Korea , a lot of my people didn &apos;t have that good fortune .
it &apos;s a very tragic fact , and that is that North Koreans have to be in bed , and that trying to survive .
even though they learn to read it , they found jobs , and the whole world is fundamentally changing .
that &apos;s why , after 10 years of age , I decided to take risks to Korea , and that &apos;s why I started a new life .
it was more difficult and challenging than I could imagine .
English is too important in Korea , so I have to start learning the third language -- English .
moreover , I realized there was a huge difference between Korea and North Korea .
even though we were all alone , our inner selves had become very different , because of the <unk> divided .
I &apos;ve even experienced self @-@ questioning .
are I Korean or North Koreans ?
where do I come from ? who am I ?
and all of a sudden , I didn &apos;t seem to be able to call any country for myself .
I didn &apos;t want to live in Korean , but I decided .
go to college .
soon after I started getting used to this new life , I got an incredible call .
the cease @-@ fire stopped the bits of my home , and as punishment , my family had to be forced , and moved to a remote place .
they had to run away , so I started to plan to get them out .
North Koreans migrate to freedom as such <unk> .
to go across the border of North Korea and South Korea , it &apos;s almost impossible , so , ironically , I flew to China and then to the border .
because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , so I had to help them cross the <unk> , into Southeast Asia .
we had a week on the bus journey , and we were almost caught .
again , we &apos;re sitting in a bus , and a Chinese officer is on the bus .
he looked at everybody &apos;s ID cards , and he started asking questions .
because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese , I feared they were caught .
so when the Chinese officer quickly checked into my house , I instinctively stand up and he told him that these are the <unk> , and I &apos;m the Chinese director .
he <unk> looking at me , but luckily , he believed me .
and we went all the way to the <unk> , but I was going to almost take all the light to bribe the border .
and even though we &apos;d been in prison , my family had been arrested for illegal participation .
after spending my life on the fine and bribe , my family was released after a month , but soon , they were caught in the capital capital capital capital , and they were arrested again .
that was one of the lowest moments in my life .
and I wanted to let my family get freedom , and the best thing I could do when it was near win , the family had to go through a prison bus , and it wasn &apos;t very far from North Korea .
I &apos;ve spent a lot of time in the <unk> and the police department , trying to get them out , trying to get them out , trying to get them out , but I don &apos;t have enough money to bribe and the fine .
I couldn &apos;t afford it .
and I heard a guy asking me , &quot; What happened ? &quot;
and I was shocked by a completely strangers asking .
I used a really bad English and tried to explain it to that guy , and the guy went on to the ATM machines , and for my family and two North Koreans paid all the rest .
and I really appreciate him , and I said , &quot; Why would you help me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m the people in North Korea . &quot;
and I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life .
the good strangers are the hope that I and North Koreans need , and he made me realize that strangers , kindness and international support , really our hope for North Koreans .
and eventually , after a long trip , I and my family were there in Korea , but the freedom was only halfway through the war .
a lot of North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they come to new countries , they usually have very little money , or they don &apos;t .
so we can train education , English training , job training , etc .
we can also bridge the gap between the people living in the world and the people living in North Korea , because a lot of us live in touch with families in North Korea , and the information and the money we have come back to bear in North Korea .
and I was so lucky , and there was so much help in my life , so I wanted to help the North Koreans , in the international aid , an opportunity to dream .
and I &apos;m confident that you &apos;re going to see more and more North Koreans are successful in the world , including TED .
thank you .
you may agree that it &apos;s a good way .
it &apos;s made of tar sands , and asphalt is a great material that drives cars on top of it , but not always , particularly , the weather conditions like this today , the rainy season .
a lot of water in <unk> .
and especially if you &apos;re riding a bicycle along the way , it &apos;s not very nice .
and at the same time , noise produces a lot of noise .
it &apos;s a little bit noisy , and if we &apos;re going to build our roads , like the Netherlands , we &apos;re going to want a little noise .
the solution is to use tar sands .
it &apos;s porous , and it has been used on most of the highways of the Dutch , and it has little pores to the water , and the water goes to the road , and the road is easy , and there &apos;s no <unk> .
the noise disappears in these pores .
because it has a lot of empty , and it <unk> the noise , so the road is silent .
and of course , it has weaknesses , and the downside of this road is that the tar sands may be <unk> .
what &apos;s called <unk> ? look at the rock off the road .
and then starting a piece , and then a little bit more , and then -- I won &apos;t demonstrate .
but they damage your windshield otherwise , you wouldn &apos;t be happy .
and in the end , it will generate more and more damage .
sometimes the road is available .
ah , he was ready .
and it turns out to be a problem , but we have a solution .
what you see here is the damage of this material .
this is the tar sands , as I said , there &apos;s a few hairs in the middle .
and because of <unk> , ultraviolet , <unk> and so on , this glue between the tar sands , the <unk> between the <unk> would contract , if it had contract , then there would be little <unk> , which would then be hierarchical .
if you &apos;re driving along this way , you &apos;re going to see these <unk> -- that &apos;s what we see .
to solve this problem , we looked at self @-@ repair materials .
if we could make this material self @-@ repair , there could be a solution .
and what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re using clean steel , we &apos;re using steel , we &apos;re able to cut the little bits of steel , we &apos;re going to cut these little <unk> .
so now the tar sands have some <unk> inside .
you need a machine like this , a touch motor -- it can cook .
sensing the motors can heat up , especially hot steel .
so what we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to heat the steel , melt the asphalt , melt the tar sands , and then the little cracks in the slope , and then the fall off .
and because of the sensing that I couldn &apos;t come up , I did it in the <unk> .
and the same principles of <unk> and <unk> .
I put it in there , and now I take it and see what happens .
this is what it looks like today .
we have four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ dozen machines in our lab that heat them up .
we tested lots of samples , and the government saw our results , and they decided , &quot; This is interesting , we should try . &quot;
the government licensed a highway for us , and we &apos;re doing a four @-@ meter distance on <unk> , and we &apos;re there .
and that &apos;s what we did . and what you see here is that the mile , of course , fails over the last few years , and we confirm that .
we took a lot of samples in the lab .
and we did our aging experiment , and we added a lot of them with our sensors to heat them up , heating and testing them .
we can make a difference .
in fact , the result of this experiment was that if we had heated every four years on this process -- the <unk> , we had to move this machine up to the highway -- we would double the life of the road , of course , on the four years .
so the conclusion is that we create a kind of material that we use , and we add <unk> to the flow of energy , we increase the longevity of the road , double the duration of the road , using this simple technique , a lot of money .
you wonder if it works .
we looked at this sample . it &apos;s a little hot now .
in fact , I want to cool it down to show you if heated works .
but try .
see , actually , fix it .
thank you .
and I want to talk to you about a very unusual animal .
there are four million birds on Earth .
<unk> are the most endangered species in them .
and when you look at the <unk> like this , the first thing that comes out of your mind is that this is some <unk> , some <unk> , some of the terrible things that come out of it , and you can &apos;t help but think about politicians .
I want to change that way . I want to change the way you think about it , because they need our compassion . they really need it .
let me tell you why .
first , why do they leave us alone ?
Charles Darwin , in the flight of the Atlantic <unk> , discovered Turkey , when he said , &quot; These <unk> , the birds of the <unk> , the birds of the waste are always <unk> out of the <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s hard to find more harmful than this one , but Charles Darwin said .
you know , Darwin went back to England and changed his mind , and I told you why .
and even Walt Whitman once saw -- <unk> , <unk> , personality @-@ like , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
and lately , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to the news of Kenya -- Kenyan MPs had been ironic and <unk> , but I &apos;d like to marry it .
I want to question it . you know why ?
because legislators can &apos;t keep the natural clean .
you can &apos;t stop transmission of disease .
almost nobody would follow a week .
they &apos;re very far away from the extinction .
and that one of my favorites is much better than the legislators .
there are four billion people in the world .
the New World War II grew mainly in the Americas , in the Americas , in the Americas , in Venezuela , and in the rest of the continent there were 16 species , and they had the risk of dying .
so why is this important ? well , first of all , they have a vital impact on ecological cycles . they do their own things .
<unk> are our natural waste products .
they would eat the meat of the dead .
they can eliminate all of the bacteria on the body , and they can absorb the transmission of the virus from the virus to prevent the spread of the virus from dying and disease .
recent studies have shown that in places that don &apos;t live , there are three to four times more damage to death and spread to disease .
there &apos;s a lot of historical significance as well .
they had a deep connection with the ancient Egypt .
there &apos;s a cultural icon of <unk> and <unk> in ancient Egypt that often comes together with the <unk> of <unk> , the unity and unity of the <unk> of Egypt in Egypt .
in the Hindus myth , <unk> <unk> <unk> , he risked his life from 10 evil spirits <unk> .
in Tibet , the <unk> <unk> <unk> are particularly important in places like Tibet , where there are no <unk> , there are no wood workers , there are no wood workers , there are no wood systems for the local people , so the <unk> provide a natural processing system .
so what &apos;s the problem with all of this ?
Kenya grows in eight <unk> , and six of them are dying .
and many of the reasons why there &apos;s been competition , which is because of the shared fight between the species and the wildlife that are happening in Kenya , where there &apos;s a poison and the drugs that are used to treat the animals , and the animal has become the next victim .
in South Asia , there are countries like India and Pakistan , and there are four that have become critically endangered , and that means that within 10 to 15 years they &apos;re going to disappear from extinction , because <unk> has been fed by genetically <unk> acid ingredients .
now there &apos;s been a ban on <unk> acid in India , and the government of India has shown a positive attitude .
due to the number of wild dogs , the wild cats are now growing wild dogs around the animal dogs , and in the wild cats , dogs like time bombs are happening every time , and the number of cases in India has dramatically increased .
Kenya is going to have the largest wind power plant in Africa : wind turbines are going to be installed in <unk> .
I &apos;m not against wind , but we should call the government to rethink the decision , because wind will threat to birds , and high @-@ speed <unk> with birds in half .
they &apos;re just birds .
in West Africa , there are people who have no sense of compassion and <unk> to meet the needs of <unk> and <unk> .
so what are we doing ? we &apos;re working on these <unk> , and we &apos;re putting on them .
we &apos;re trying to figure out what the relationship is with the environment , and see what happens .
and we found that they travel between different countries , so if you &apos;re just looking at a region , you can &apos;t make a difference .
we need to deal with government governments throughout the region .
we &apos;re trying to communicate with local residents .
we &apos;re trying to get them to understand the good quality of life , and to appreciate the amazing creatures and their contribution to nature .
what can you do ? you can do it , make a decision . you can write to your government and tell them , we need to focus on the really wrong creatures . take a moment to tell the people around you .
and when you walk out of this room , you &apos;re <unk> , not only to tell your family , but to tell your neighbors about their neighbors .
they were so elegant . Charles Darwin once said that he had changed his mind , and after he saw that <unk> were in the air , and then gradually agreed .
Kenya , around the world , is going to lose a lot of losses .
thank you very much .
people around us can help us make life better .
we don &apos;t necessarily always meet our neighbors , so even though we live in a public space , the intelligence of our neighbors is <unk> .
so in the last few years , I &apos;ve been trying to give a bunch of stickers , different ones , and these simple tools , to share more with their neighbors .
all of these projects came from some of my own questions , like , how much does my neighbor rent ?
how can we get from the neighborhood to the point where we don &apos;t want to open up the door ?
how can we share our own memories of what was destroyed and better understanding this land that we live in ?
how do we express our expectations and our dreams ?
I live in New Orleans and fell in love with the city .
the giant trees of the waste trees that could touch my soul for hundreds of years and hundreds and hundreds of people , and people would always believe that this is a city full of music .
and I felt like a New Orleans member of New Orleans when someone came to a protest .
New Orleans had the most beautiful buildings in the world , but at the same time , she was the most abandoned city in America .
and I was living in this neighborhood , and I was trying to figure out how to make it a better place in this neighborhood and think about something different , and it changed my life completely .
in 2009 , I lost a person I loved .
her name was <unk> , and to me , she was like my mother , and she died very suddenly , and no one had anticipated .
and then I thought a lot of things about death , and then -- -- -- -- -- -- this is what really makes me feel good about my time , with the woman , with the presence of the woman , with the <unk> of my life .
but I was struggling to maintain that mindset in my daily life .
and I felt that people were so incredibly adept at day and day @-@ to @-@ day and day @-@ to @-@ day @-@ to @-@ day things were really important .
and so I made a big blackboard , and I put one side of this abandoned house into a giant blackboard , and as soon as I died , I thought , &quot; Well , everybody by the way can pick up a piece of chalk and keep some of their life in the open .
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but the next day , the whole wall was filled and there was a new answer .
I want to share with you some of the things that people have on the wall .
before I die , I want to take a trial for my release .
before I die , I want to cross .
before I die , I want to sing in front of a million people . &quot;
&quot; before dying , a tree . &quot;
before I die , I want to live a <unk> . &quot;
before I die , I want to hold her again . &quot;
before I die , I wanted to be someone &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
before I die , I want to be completely true . &quot;
it was a place where the forgotten architecture had turned into a very constructive place where the hopes and dreams made me laugh and laughing and laughing and <unk> and gave me comfort .
it makes us believe that we &apos;re not alone .
let &apos;s take a new paradigm of inspiration from the neighbors .
and it reminded us of a space of reflection and thinking , and it also reminds us of what is important in the process of changing .
this blackboard , which I &apos;ve been doing last year , and I &apos;ve been getting people to send me messages to people who want to create walls like this in their communities , and so my colleagues and I have a small toolbox , and this wall has spread across the globe , and so on .
and these signs suggest that if we could have an expressive will and share it with others , then public spaces play a huge role .
one of the most valuable two things we have , one , time and one , is connected to another .
in the midst of this incredible period of time , trying to maintain the self , to remember that life has become more important than it has ever been .
we &apos;re always talking about death and dying , and we &apos;re thinking about dying , but I realize that being dead is one of the most powerful things we can do .
think about death , making you more conscious of your own life .
public space can be a better way to express our hopes , our fears and our experiences , both for individuals or for the community , to share our hopes , our fears , our experiences , our experiences , not only to help us create a better life .
thank you .
thank you .
I was in a mines under 50 meters deep in Ghana .
the air is hot , filled with dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
and I could feel that people had wiped out from me , but I couldn &apos;t see anything else .
I heard voices around me , but there were more noise in the form of stone tools .
and like everybody else , I had this big <unk> knife on my head , with a beat @-@ up knife tied on my neck , and I <unk> down into the branches of the wall , and they &apos;re holding this one meter @-@ long <unk> .
my hands came over , and immediately came to a miner who happened to a miner who had fallen his hand and died .
when I stand here today with you today , the miners who are still in mines like this , they &apos;re working in mines , they &apos;re not paid .
I finally climbed out of mines and got home to the miners that never came home .
in the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been photographing domestic films in the country of the domestic culture , and in 2009 , I &apos;ve been so privileged to be able to go to the <unk> peace summit .
there &apos;s a lot of people that I met , a lot of them , and I met this guy called the <unk> <unk> , an organization that works to eradicate the modern world .
we talked about slavery , and at this point I started to really understand the reality of slavery , even though I &apos;ve always known about slavery in the world , but I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on .
and after our conversation ended , I felt really bad and failed to feel ashamed of this <unk> thing , and I didn &apos;t know , how many people did it ?
and this led me to a couple of weeks later , when I flew to Los Angeles to see the head of &quot; The Red Sox , &quot; and I wanted to do something .
and that started my journey into contemporary forms of slavery .
oddly enough , I &apos;ve been there .
I &apos;ve got them as my second home .
but this time , I &apos;m going to find the secret of the light that I &apos;ve never seen .
and it &apos;s estimated that there are more than 27 million people around the world today who live in slavery .
this number is twice the number of people sold in the Atlantic slave trade from Africa .
150 years ago , there was a price for generating goods in the United States .
that &apos;s 50,000 dollars today .
but today , the cost of a whole family is <unk> , maybe 18 dollars .
and the shocking thing is that the profits of over 130 billion dollars a year in the world .
a lot of them were fake , and a lot of them were put into a kind of commitment , a kind of education , a good job , a place where there was a place where there was no danger , and there was no escape .
today slavery is about commercial products , but the people who create value are invisible .
it exists in almost every corner of the world , even though it &apos;s illegal .
in India and Nepal , I was brought in to medicine .
it was a very strange sight , as if you walked into the <unk> or the <unk> Valley .
men , women , in the heat of the 50 , children , in fact , the whole family is packed with dust under a thick of dust , holding bricks and sticking them onto their heads at 18 feet , and then bringing them to a few hundred kilometers away .
<unk> and tired of hanging them out , quietly working , doing the same thing over and over again , 16 to 17 hours a day .
you can &apos;t relax , you can &apos;t eat , you can &apos;t drink it because of extreme water , and they don &apos;t need toilets .
and because of the hot air and dust , my camera couldn &apos;t work .
every 20 minutes , I had to go back to the car and clean up my equipment , and let it sit underneath the air conditioning , and it would give me a pause , and the camera would be much better than the living person .
and I went back to the <unk> , and I wanted to cry , but the <unk> that came along , and he said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t cry here . &quot;
and then he explained to me that in places like this , it was very dangerous not only for me , but for the workers .
I couldn &apos;t afford to give them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money . I couldn &apos;t afford anything .
I &apos;m not the citizens of that country .
my behavior might make them worse than now .
I was expecting the Free <unk> to be able to work within the system , so I believed they could .
and in my case , I have to wait for the home to get this heartache .
and in the meantime , I saw a kid in the Himalayas , with a rock and a couple of miles on the side of the road , waiting for trucks .
the kids on the front page are heavy , and the kids use the sticks , the toys , the clothes they beat themselves .
it &apos;s an incredibly painful experience to see this .
how can we intervene in these hidden arguments , but are there universal <unk> ?
some people don &apos;t even think that they &apos;re on a daily basis for a day of slavery , and that &apos;s because they &apos;re born to it .
there &apos;s no comparison .
if these people were to fight for their freedom , they lit up all their houses .
and these people had nothing to do with them , and they wanted to give up , but the women in the middle of the crowd continued to help them fight the <unk> , so they continued to <unk> on their own <unk> , but now they have freedom for themselves .
and the reason why they &apos;re listening to slavery is that most of the things that we &apos;ve heard about slavery is because I know that around the world I was warn you , if I keep on taking pictures of the industry , it &apos;s not going to be safe .
I was struck by a woman who had been a woman who had been a woman .
they took me down the narrow staircase and went into a filthy basement .
this is not a <unk> .
it &apos;s more like a restaurant .
the balconies are used to be used to be used for prostitution .
in little cubicle , <unk> women and children are only seven years old to please their customers and to make them spend more food and wine .
each chamber has a very dirty darkness , and the number is drawn from the curtains and curtains .
people who work in this room tend to abuse their victims .
remember , I was standing in the middle of a dark , and I was struck by this intense fear of what I was trying to be trapped in this hell .
there &apos;s only one <unk> : the staircase .
there &apos;s no back door .
there &apos;s no window .
these are people who are completely unable to escape , and when we &apos;re confronted with such difficult topics , we need to know about slavery , including <unk> in our backyard .
there are thousands of restaurants , and there are hundreds of restaurants , and there are more than that .
recently , the New York Times has reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children every year being traded .
and we just don &apos;t know what happens .
and that &apos;s when we hear about slavery .
I visited a village <unk> in India .
this is the portrait of a family . &quot;
the hands of those blue and red hands belong to two sons .
they stir this in a spray , and then they pop the silk , and then they put it in , until the cursor <unk> the elbow , and they &apos;re all harmful .
the translator told me their story .
we don &apos;t have freedom . they say .
but we still hope , and God forbid from that room to elsewhere , where work is getting paid .
it &apos;s estimated that over 4,000 children are killed in the <unk> lake , the largest <unk> in the world .
we had one or two , and I went to see this .
I see it as a whole family of two brothers fishing on the boat , a few little dots , like ?
wrong . they &apos;re slave slaves .
kids are sold out from their homes , and they &apos;re working on boats that don &apos;t work , and they don &apos;t even swim .
this boy is eight years old .
and as we approached the ship , he was shaking on the <unk> of our canoe .
he was scared to fall in the water .
and the branches of the trees that come in , often , are packed in the net , and the kids that are tired and afraid to be thrown in the water to check the net .
a lot of people drowning .
and since he started his day , he was forced to work in the air .
he was terrified of the owner , and he was unable to escape because he was treated as a child , and he treated him in the same way .
I saw these boys at 5 o &apos;clock in the morning working in the last net , and they went from one in the morning .
it was so cold , it was so cold .
you have to know that the net weight of the fish is full of fish .
I want to introduce you to the <unk> .
he got out of a fishing village .
he saw him in a homeless shelter , and the World Trade Center was a place for <unk> victims .
and in this photograph , he &apos;s putting together a bath on his head , and the good news is that right now there &apos;s more <unk> than there are family members who have been able to make a living for themselves and make sure that kids are safe .
there &apos;s a possibility .
because someone shows up a position , and it can change his future .
driving in a pathway in Ghana , with a partners in the United States , with a steel rush on the side of Ghana , <unk> up into our cars .
and he asked us to change a <unk> into the jungle .
at the end of the road , he urged us to get out of the car .
and then he pointed to a series of <unk> that said , &quot; Here it is , walk ! &quot;
and we were dragging around the fruit of the <unk> for about an hour and a half of the rain , and I was recently killed , and I was taking the gear on my head and drinking the water from the chest .
and after two hours of <unk> and <unk> , we had a big <unk> in front of us , and we had a huge <unk> in every square place .
a lot of women are still carrying their own little child , and they &apos;re walking in the dirty water .
mercury are used to extract gold .
these people were slavery in another mine in Ghana .
when they come out of mines , they &apos;re full of mines .
I remember that they were all tired of their eyes , and a lot of them were working in 72 hours .
and these rocks are about 90 feet deep , and they &apos;re packed with bags full of rocks , and these rocks are transported to another area , and the gold is <unk> .
men and women who fell in love , and they robust , and we found that some people in the edges of the communities , and there were other children .
they were victims of violence .
in fact , the men who have been robust are likely to suffer from this man , day after years .
this is <unk> . when his father died , his uncle sold him to this mine .
and in his uncle &apos;s death , the uncle is still going to carry on his uncle &apos;s <unk> , and he &apos;s forced to continue to work in mines .
and when I met him , he had been working on a mining village for 14 years , and it was one of the doctors who had an accident , and the doctors said he wanted an amputation .
apart from this injury , he had tuberculosis , and he had to work every day .
and even so , he wanted to be able to come back and be free to be able to support the education of education , which is the belief that there is such an unprecedented suffering .
and I want us to give those people a little bit of money .
and as I was photographing this , I took a lot of candles , I gave them my photographs , and I wanted to be able to light their stories and their failures when we were all safe .
they know these images will be seen from the outside .
I want them to know that we &apos;re going to make a difference in their lives .
and I really believe that when we think of them as people , it &apos;s very difficult to tolerate the atrocities of slavery .
these images aren &apos;t about issues , they &apos;re about people , and they &apos;re about people , and they &apos;re about to get the same rights and respect for your life .
I didn &apos;t want these beautiful , but I was surrounded by people who didn &apos;t want to meet .
and I want these images to be able to evoke a power in the viewer &apos;s mind , and I want the <unk> of that power to be the light of slavery , because without this light , this light will live in a shadow .
thank you .
speaking , I &apos;m an application of mathematics for everyone who studies math , there &apos;s a special problem , and that is that we &apos;re very similar to management consultants .
nobody knows what we are .
so I &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we do today .
well , dancing is one of the many activities of humankind .
we were <unk> and <unk> , and we were <unk> , and you would know that later .
now ballet needs an extraordinary range of expertise and brilliant expertise and even some level of <unk> .
but sadly , the nervous system disease , like Parkinson &apos;s disease , is slowly <unk> this extraordinary ability to happen to his friend <unk> , who used to be the great <unk> of his age .
in those years , he had a lot of therapy and a lot of advances .
and yet , there are <unk> people in the world who suffer from this disease , and they have to endure , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so on , we need an objective tool to test it before we get it .
we need objective measurements , and in the end , we want to know when there &apos;s a cure for cancer , and the only way we have the objective answer to those questions is to answer the question .
but it &apos;s annoying when you get Parkinson &apos;s and a whole bunch of other <unk> diseases , so you can &apos;t do simple blood tests , and the best thing we can do is , like , a 20 @-@ minute neuroscience test .
you have to get clinics , and it costs a lot of money , which means that no one has ever done this before , never done this test before .
but what if the patient could do this at home ?
what if the patient could do it alone ?
it doesn &apos;t take a lot of money to hire employees .
by the way , if you go to a neurologist , this costs about 300 dollars .
so I want to suggest to you an alternative approach , an approach that we can try and achieve , because you know , in a sense , at least we &apos;re all like my friend <unk> .
I &apos;ve got a video about <unk> <unk> .
this is someone in a healthy state , and we think of ourselves as the <unk> of sound , because when we make sound , we have to coordinate these <unk> , and indeed these are born with <unk> genes .
and like ballet , it needs to be trained in special training .
think about it . how long would it take ?
from the sound , we can follow the positions of <unk> , just like Parkinson &apos;s , and it can affect us all .
you can see that the <unk> on the bottom is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
we saw the same symptoms .
sound <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
speech can become <unk> , and then there &apos;s more <unk> , and these are symptoms .
in fact , this sound is a lot of times <unk> , but as long as you have a digital mic on it , you have a sophisticated voice analysis , and you have a very cutting @-@ edge machine learning right now , and we can now be able to put it right where other people are healthy and disease on a straight line , which is just a sign of speech .
so what do they do with speech @-@ based testing , and what do they do with specialized clinical trials ? they &apos;re all <unk> .
neuroscience testing is <unk> , and they use existing infrastructure .
you don &apos;t need to design a new set of hospitals to do it .
they &apos;re all <unk> . they &apos;re not experts on speech .
that means they can do it themselves .
and it &apos;s going fast . it &apos;s about 30 seconds .
the price was low , and we knew how to do it .
and once it &apos;s released , it can be scaled at large .
I &apos;ve got some of the great goals out there .
we can reduce the number of problems with the patient .
there &apos;s no need to go to the clinic and do routine tests .
we can monitor objective data with high @-@ resolution data .
we have a very low @-@ cost and very low @-@ risk testing , and we can also show the scale of the population in the first place .
and we also had the opportunity to start looking for this kind of illness that we had in the early days of life .
so , from here today , the first step into this direction , we started <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
working with <unk> and <unk> , we would like to record a lot of data from around the world to get these four goals .
our <unk> number connected seven million calls on Earth .
anyone who has a healthy or a Parkinson &apos;s disease can come in , it &apos;s cheap , it &apos;s cheap , it &apos;s cheap , it &apos;s just a little bit of money , and I &apos;m glad to announce that we &apos;ve only achieved six percent of our goals in eight hours .
thank you .
Max , based on these samples , can you tell who is healthy , who is the disease ?
what do you want to get from these specimens ?
yes , yes . so this is what you have to tell us if you have this disease . <unk> : mmm .
you know , some people might not call us , or maybe not .
but we still get a lot of samples from different environments , and the point is different conditions , because then we can eliminate the causes of these mix factors , and we can actually look for a disease .
so you &apos;ve got about 86 percent accuracy right now ?
that &apos;s more or less .
as a matter of fact , my student <unk> , I have to mention that he &apos;s doing some pretty good work , and now he &apos;s proven that the mobile phone can do this online , so we &apos;re approaching 99 percent accuracy .
okay , that &apos;s pretty cool .
so that means that people can -- -- people can use your mobile phone to call in your phone and then do this test , and then they can get on the phone and then record the sound , and then their doctor can check out where they &apos;re going .
that &apos;s it .
thank you very much , Max and all of you .
thank you .
I &apos;ve been fascinated by photography since I &apos;ve been a camera , but I &apos;d like to share with you 15 pictures of what I love most , none of them .
there &apos;s no artistic director , there &apos;s no opportunity , there &apos;s no hope , let &apos;s forget .
in fact , most of these are random visitors .
my story was taken on a night in New York , and my wife took a picture of me , and I was on her one @-@ year @-@ old daughter , and we stood on the <unk> Avenue and on <unk> Avenue .
and one year later , we went back to New York , and we decided to take the same photograph .
you can guess what happened .
and as the daughter was three years old , the wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you ever want to go back to New York , take a look , continue this little tradition ? &quot;
and that &apos;s where we started looking for visitors .
you know , taking the camera to a total stranger is common and unusual .
nobody says no , luckily , no one &apos;s got our camera <unk> .
and we didn &apos;t know it would change our lives deeply .
it became sacred to us .
this was taken a couple of weeks after 9 / 11 , and I was trying to explain what happened on September 11th , trying to figure out the way that this five @-@ year @-@ olds understood .
so these pictures are not only documenting a moment , or a particularly journey .
they &apos;re the way we remember one week of the October , and let &apos;s think about the years , and how we can change over year and years , not just the changes of our bodies , but the changes in our bodies .
because I photographed the same photographs every year , our eyes were different , and the daughter came to a new milestone , and I watched through her eyes and how she reacted , and how she looked at everything .
this is the time we spent on time , the most anticipated time in a year .
and recently , we walked along the way , and she stopped , and she pointed up on the red shoe of a store and she said she liked the suit , and the coat was very happy to start with us .
she explained to me when she was five years old , she stood on that photo array .
she said she remembers the first time she saw that her heart was about to jump , and that was nine years ago .
now she went to New York on a college campus , because she decided to go to New York .
and I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is our memories .
so I want to share with you the idea of creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but I personally , I don &apos;t know what happens to my family photographs , except for these 15 photographs .
I always took that photo .
I would like to encourage all of you in this room , to get to the photographs , to get people to the front , to go , &quot; Can you take a picture ? &quot;
thank you .
