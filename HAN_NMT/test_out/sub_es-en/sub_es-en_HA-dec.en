if you don &apos;t believe me ...
if you can &apos;t trust me then i can &apos;t stay here !
darling , even if , sometimes , i &apos;m angry ... i love you anyway .
i just wanted to find out what terrible carelessness your husband is to leave you alone at this hour of the night .
how can a husband , who loves his wife , do such a thing !
i love you ... i can &apos;t help it ... nobody could !
wait ... i &apos;ll be right back .
come upstairs ... and get another taxi on the phone .
don &apos;t worry ... he &apos;ll be back .
you won &apos;t come back .
i can &apos;t live without you !
professor <unk> has gone home .
josef !
i need love !
i promised to tell professor <unk> the last chess game .
1 : 10 am dr. braun and mrs. <unk> arrive in a taxi and enter the house .
1 : 15 am . a light goes on in the room .
1 : 22 am . shadows disappear .
observations :
when i left at 1 : 50 , dr. braun was still there .
get your things together .
in the morning , when you can &apos;t look at the sun in your face .
go away and leave me alone ...
or i &apos;ll tell my husband !
i had a terrible dream ...
gustav was <unk> !
that &apos;s what happens ...
when you leave me alone .
it &apos;s true ... but i give you my word , my visit was completely innocent .
i believe you , but no one else will , and i &apos;m glad to have a man of your stature helping me to get rid of my wife .
by the way , <unk> is at the bristol hotel since this morning .
franz !
there &apos;s a man in this ... but who ?
franz , i suppose my husband told you everything .
why didn &apos;t you come to my house , if you wanted to tell me you didn &apos;t love me ?
trust me , who is this man ?
my husband ... and my best friend !
i &apos;m innocent ... i haven &apos;t done anything .
here &apos;s the proof !
franz :
is it my fault your husband fell in love with me ?
i &apos;ll send you a copy .
the horrible end of a dreadful day .
you must talk to charlotte ... you &apos;re the only one she really trusts .
wait , franz , boy i &apos;ll teach you a lesson , so you &apos;ll never look at another woman again .
we &apos;d better go the back way .
don &apos;t ask me to forgive ... i &apos;m as guilty as you are .
gustav &apos;s kiss wasn &apos;t a dream , it was real ... in this room ... in that chair !
tell me ... didn &apos;t you come back to this room last night ?
don &apos;t we kiss ?
half and half .
<unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>
i can die in peace because i lived a great love .
at the master &apos;s mansion .
tell mr. michael to give me my <unk> sketches .
i &apos;d like to speak to mr. <unk>
the butler .
the princess .
<unk> , the journalist .
claude <unk> , the teacher .
i &apos;ve already been offered $ <unk> for these sketches , but i couldn &apos;t help it , to part with it .
we &apos;re not going yet to sell our most beautiful memoirs .
please contact mr. <unk> , i &apos;ll be back before the opera .
still one of these russian princesses who want to be painted at all costs by the master .
do you have a monopoly on the owner ?
how did you become a master &apos;s model , and almost his son ?
four years ago ...
his sketches are worthless .
come back when you &apos;ve learned to see properly .
i &apos;d like to hear it !
would you pose for me ?
you owe him a lot , michael !
but the teacher owes him a lot too !
his glory was born from the paintings you prayed for .
at the table , conversation <unk> around death .
it &apos;s strange , sometimes i &apos;m so afraid of death that i don &apos;t know how to explain it .
i keep from horror !
i &apos;m not afraid of death because with her it must be a prediction .
i can &apos;t imagine any more beautiful end than dying to be worshipped
to me , death is simply the last lap of life
do you know that your conversation inspired me a new painting ?
i &apos;m going to paint caesar killed by <unk> , his son <unk> .
and who will look like <unk> ?
<unk> takes notes of our spiritual conversation for the play he writes about the teacher
what was the prediction , duke , about what was spoken at the table ?
the last of <unk> will know a great happiness
... and he &apos;ll pay with his life
the butler just announced his car is leaving .
i &apos;m sorry , i never paint <unk> portraits .
but since you are , i &apos;m going to <unk>
michael , the protector !
the princess &apos;s finances must be <unk>
you probably expect to increase your credit by <unk> the master .
but it &apos;s you !
may i come tomorrow for the first pose ?
the <unk> is my best picture ,
i &apos;ll give it to you .
one day , everything will be fine .
never was a painting so painful to the teacher that the portrait of princess <unk>
you haven &apos;t slept for three nights !
is that reasonable ?
when i &apos;m alone , i see you take in front of me , you march .
but when she &apos;s sitting here , everything disappears
where &apos;s michael ?
he goes to the opera every afternoon , where he looks tenderly at a little rat .
go now , i want to work
i &apos;ll be back after lunch
you are guilty of my sleepless nights , princess .
serve the food , let &apos;s eat !
aren &apos;t we expecting michael ?
today we &apos;ll drink in english glass
the gentleman and madame already sat at the table
did you sit at the table without me ?
i &apos;ve never been treated like this before .
this sound of his eyes that i cannot give up
does she look like her ?
try it , you !
yes , now , those are his eyes !
only youth can guess this
eyes well <unk>
it was michael who painted them .
how did you know my eyes so well ?
where have you been all this time ?
unfortunately i must leave
i &apos;m going to the theater this afternoon .
you &apos;re the only one who suspects nothing
about michael and the <unk>
then it &apos;s her
tell the butler to bring the english glass to my quarters .
the teacher gave me permission
take the board , mr. michael &apos;s out .
close the window
that afternoon , the opera ballet danced
the lake of <unk>
don &apos;t you feel , don &apos;t you see how much i suffer ?
have pity on me , my friend ...
how about dinner after the performance , mr. <unk> ?
go now , we &apos;ll meet soon
i wish to make you believe that eternity exists .
michael &apos;s visits to the master became increasingly strange , <unk> only by the last conscience of duty .
the thing in himself is just a <unk>
he came to ask me for a lot of money lately .
youth fully wants to live is an age where money is needed .
charge this sum to me !
from now on , you &apos;ll have your own account at my banker &apos;s .
and then you can start a new page
now leave me alone , michael .
we could see in his last play a portrait of princess z.
no true <unk> only the eyes make the exception .
the effect is so impractical that you realize that the eyes have been painted by another hand .
who knows about the history of the <unk> &apos;s eyes ?
you
yes , and him ?
you need someone to tell you the truth and the truth , it &apos;s ... that you hate him from the first day .
because he forced the entrance of my life where you wanted to be the only one to play a part
nobody knows when i &apos;m alone
no one has the right to increase my loneliness
claude <unk> , i beg you ... to make yourself more miserable disappointments .
let the boy go
no , charles , i don &apos;t want to die without my child .
why didn &apos;t you ever tell me about this ?
<unk> mercier , the art dealer .
have him come in immediately .
calm down , my dear .
everything &apos;s going to be all right , i found a solution .
michel &apos;s place is in his place .
to paint the country .
how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s all right , thank you .
mr. <unk> , <unk> of art objects
i begged you to come , mr. <unk> , because i &apos;d like you to insist on selling my caesar and <unk>
it &apos;s magnificent , but ...
i mean , at last ... an atmosphere can be <unk> , is this the way ?
and an atmosphere can be <unk>
that &apos;s the situation .
another one of his <unk> is in the market ...
the <unk> ...
i order you to rescue the <unk>
under a pen name
i don &apos;t care about the price
put the picture in michael &apos;s room , that &apos;s his place .
from that day on ,
claude mazard closed the door to everyone to create his masterpiece in complete solitude and when it was finished ,
michael &apos;s back .
bring wine !
for heaven &apos;s sake , i was inspired by the <unk> sketches .
today , for michael &apos;s party , we &apos;ll drink in english glass
i took them .
i have enough to do ...
i have enough to be your model , the instrument of your glory .
i want to finally be a free man , not depend on your good graces any more .
princess <unk> is asking for mr. michael on the phone .
i &apos;ll never answer what you just told me , michael .
back home .
why don &apos;t you say something ?
speak .
what could i say , not make you suffer ?
it came at last the day the master <unk> his work .
the duchess , widow of <unk> <unk> <unk>
forgive my concern , mr. <unk> .
he &apos;s a man who &apos;s lost everything .
my child , forgive this question of a troubled mother :
do you know where my son is ?
tell alice that the last <unk> paid for her happiness
the painter of pain ... the glory of the nation ...
then the calm <unk> again at the master &apos;s mansion .
unfortunately i couldn &apos;t come .
i brought the reviews
may i introduce you ?
may i introduce you ?
everyone writes about the sky of your work is the most wonderful thing you &apos;ve ever painted .
now , i &apos;ll give you $ 60,000 for the sketches .
in fact , where are your <unk> sketches ?
i &apos;d like very much to see you
but mr. michael just left ... with a big cardboard box of drawings .
does <unk> have ...
it &apos;s true , however , i had forgotten ... that i offered the sketches .
yes , charles , i &apos;m tired now . i want to sleep now .
but in the course of the night , the master &apos;s destiny is fulfilled .
the master is dying .
<unk> .
return this as quickly as possible to mr. michael .
i , claude <unk> , who knows the loneliness in this world , <unk> my last <unk> here .
all my assets must go to my son , <unk> michael .
did michael come ?
will he be here soon ?
mr. michael is not here for anyone .
i want to rest in the middle of the field
where the seeds grow and the grass grows , and no one must know the place where it is buried .
is that why you &apos;re crying ?
jules , my friend , stop crying .
i go there where the heart knows the rest
what are you smiling at , claude ?
charles , now i can die in peace .
for i knew a great love
mr. michael the master is dead !
calm down , calm down ...
i &apos;m next to you .
the navigator
our story is one of those strange jokes that sometimes fate plays .
no one would believe that the quiet lives of a boy and a girl could change for a small war between two small and distant countries .
gentlemen , the enemy has acquired the <unk> steamer .
there he is .
we &apos;ll drop him adrift in the fog before the crew sails .
the wind , the tide and the rocks will do the rest .
the former owner of the <unk> .
and his daughter .
the heir to fortune - a life insurance that every family must have to have to <unk> the <unk> .
i think i &apos;ll get married .
today .
we &apos;re sailing for honolulu tomorrow on our honeymoon , buy two tickets .
you &apos;ve completed all <unk> , except to warn the girl .
will you marry me ?
of course not !
i think a long walk would do me good .
your tickets , sir , and congratulations .
the boat leaves at 10 : 00 in the morning , sir .
i &apos;m not up so early .
going on a honeymoon without a wife is like singing <unk> &apos;s handwriting comparing me with alice &apos;s music , where are you ?
which pier , sir ?
pier two .
i &apos;ve got some papers to pick up at pier 12 .
anybody aboard ?
in the dark of the night , foreign agents are preparing to carry out their plans .
the next morning the <unk> is drifting .
nice time to ask me that .
i &apos;m cold , hungry and ...
lift the one that shines .
they &apos;re in quarantine .
try to understand me !
hey , wait a minute !
when they were going to say good night , they found two sailor suits .

many brave hearts are deeply asleep .
look out !

we found the crew in a quiet , safe place to sleep .

the next day the master completely solved the mystery ... with the exception of locating the pearls and finding the thief .
your assistant :
gillette .
a brilliant man , always attentive to the evil elements .
this is a detective .
when he &apos;s dead , i &apos;ll put him there .
and now i &apos;ll tell you where our little charm is !
and she &apos;s waiting for me there .
be careful or one of us will get hurt .
closed road .
i never thought you &apos;d do that .
brake on the four wheels .
my father sent me to tell you that we &apos;ve made a terrible mistake .
this happened in <unk> during the reign of <unk> .
this had happened on the throne of egypt to the great rameses , who had lived 80 times the annual <unk> of the nile .
the pharaoh had a daughter , <unk> , the lotus flower of love , princess ruler of egypt <unk> by the gods .
he was also at court <unk> , nephew of pharaoh .
his dark , determined air , ambitious projects .
the heir of pharaoh was <unk> , prince of egypt , the son of the sun , <unk> to <unk> , the god with the head of egypt .
far from being blinded by power and luxury , humble and honest <unk> .
in their <unk> there were salesmen , dancers , <unk> , officers and many more than expected to see the prince .
among them was <unk> , write and poet of memphis , who sought an occasion to show his works to prince <unk> .
whoa , whoa , my <unk> !
what keeps you day after day running around in circles around the palace rooms ?
quick as the rooster <unk> a seed , you took my gold , <unk> .
take me or take me to the prince , for you are his chela .
your heart is full of boredom , my prince .
boredom , my wise <unk> , is a disease that only cowards , some children and madmen are cured .
outside there &apos;s a writing called <unk> , thin silhouette and marked features , who pretends to be his highness &apos;s twin brother , born under the same star <unk> .
<unk> , the writer ?
send him in immediately !
for countless days , o royal son of the sun , i have sought your presence to , if you will permit , write a story .
forget the praise , we &apos;re not in court , and we &apos;ve been neglecting your work for a long time , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
you are indeed my twin brother , anne @-@ ra , and as long as you are worthy , you will not regret any of my thoughts .
the poet <unk> <unk> from now on as his secretary .
you &apos;ll think of everything .
age and worries <unk> pharaoh <unk>
<unk> , my daughter , princess ruler of egypt , is to you , at all costs , to whom i wish my succession on the throne of egypt , and not to <unk>
or you , <unk> , <unk> son of the old dynasty
<unk> , you must marry <unk> immediately in order that your strength may guide his weakness .
<unk> likes studies , sovereign father .
he doesn &apos;t love me , his <unk> , and he doesn &apos;t like politics either .
however , the <unk> law of egypt must be respected , and the pharaoh &apos;s heir cannot marry a lower rank person is my last word !
let &apos;s go and look at <unk> .
i want to be your guide .
follow the prince , but do not notice .
be good !
surround the walls and the temple of <unk> and <unk> !
<unk> <unk> !
from 400 years ago , the <unk> <unk> under the yoke of egyptian kingdom .
at that time he was among the <unk> moses , his prophet .
i saw the misery of my people in egypt and heard their cries against their <unk> .
nathan &apos;s daughter , descendant of <unk> , of the people of israel .
nathan , his father , born of a noble family of israel , a slave of egypt .
is it you they called the moon of israel before the goddess of truth ?
by jove , you &apos;re beautiful !
such pretty hands shouldn &apos;t work making bricks .
you have to come live at my house
i &apos;d rather be <unk> by snakes !
in the streets of <unk>
they &apos;re <unk> slaves on their way to their camp , exhausted and covered with dirt .
who are you , dog , to have the audacity to teach a pharaoh &apos;s officer what to do ?
i am <unk> , son of pharaoh and ruler of <unk>
take him to the temple of <unk>
as ruler of <unk> , master of life and death , i declare the court open .
captain <unk> wanted me , who was engaged to a <unk> since childhood , to go with him to his house , and i refused him .
<unk> wanted to take revenge on me and he threatened to attack my father .
now , <unk> , don &apos;t shut up anything you have to say .
i deserve death , o my prince , because i hit you without knowing who you were .
do these slaves not die every day , one way or another ?
let all egyptians know that he must not kill any <unk> , unless he <unk> our laws .
<unk>
oh , prince , the most fair of all , now i am your servant forever .
officers , escort this lady to her village in the country of <unk>
the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> gave the impression that the god <unk> and the goddess isis <unk> for the second time under the same heaven vault .
and that same afternoon ...
i have married you , <unk> <unk> , as i have been ordered and as it has been ordained , now i am on my way to the country of <unk> , and <unk> , the poet accompanied me .
behind the last <unk> chain , in the middle of the desert was the country of <unk> and that &apos;s where <unk> stopped his courting
but in the desert someone keeps looking for peace .
it was <unk> , the moon of israel
the moon of israel !
charming as the moon , mysterious as the moon !
o god of my fathers , help my poor heart of sinner , who gives himself up to an egyptian .
who is the happy egyptian who has won your heart , <unk> ?
it &apos;s <unk> , whom i &apos;m engaged to
finally , they came to jabez &apos;s house , the uncle of <unk> .
why are you alone with an egyptian ?
slave , do not attack the prince of egypt .
eight full days before <unk> left the country of <unk>
<unk> , i &apos;ll follow you
captain , you stay behind us with your company , not let yourself be seen .
who knows what can happen in this region ?
since the day they stood before jabez &apos;s house , <unk> and <unk> had never seen each other again .
today is the day of the <unk> , my prince , day of prayer in the temple for all the <unk>
perhaps it was the curiosity that made the prince go to the temple ...
no doubt it was rather the hope of seeing <unk> there again .
the <unk> tore off the veil !
he <unk> the <unk> !
<unk> the <unk> !
men of israel , have you lost your senses ?
will you bring pharaoh &apos;s wrath upon us ?
jehovah will protect us !
get out of here to the <unk> and <unk> !
my friends , if i have offended your god , it was not my intention .
please , you &apos;re crazy !
if jehovah is offended shouldn &apos;t he rather take revenge on the prince himself ?
don &apos;t worry , let the trial of god speak .
if this man &apos;s heart is evil , he will die .
if nothing happens to him , let him go in peace .
i beg you , o prince , to leave this country as soon as possible , your life is in danger .
i was looking for adventure and found nothing but a little setback .
at sunset , the prince &apos;s chariot reached the pass of the <unk> mountains , on the border of <unk> country
the murderers !
turn around , prince <unk> !
turn around !
they lay an ambush on you
run like never and alert the guard !
i thank my god for saving you , my prince
and that &apos;s how <unk> found refuge against the wrath of his people in the palace of <unk>
the moon of israel is not a traitor .
she will protect her people from pharaoh &apos;s vengeance .
<unk> of <unk> , god of war !
i thought you &apos;d kill a poet and look !
i found a soldier !
fate <unk> a strange bow around us .
how could i thank you for saving my life , moon of israel ?
forgive me if in my happiness to see you safe , i spoke too much since you are the prince of egypt and i alone the moon of israel , your slave .
is this the <unk> you brought from the country of <unk> ?
our <unk> has led me to you
prince hikaru loves you , <unk> .
only you can draw the sword from the heart of israel
o prince of egypt , i appeal to you protect my people from death by the sword of pharaoh .
and i thee wed , my husband , deliver his people to the sword that has deserved .
<unk> , god of all the gods , release the children of israel that i have betrayed !
let us say that jehovah is more powerful than the great gods of egypt .
i will pray to your temple and ask my god to perform a miracle in front of <unk> @-@ <unk> .
if he doesn &apos;t listen to me , the priests of arkam will want to take revenge on me for the <unk>
the battle of the gods at the temple of <unk>
don &apos;t worry .
the gods of egypt <unk> this <unk>
oh , amon @-@ ra !
father of the gods , listen to your priest and servant .
this woman of israel defies you .
she places her god taller than you and asks you to kill him if possible .
lord of life and terror , shows your power and <unk> this girl and her false god .
jehovah , god of my parents , give a sign to this idol , <unk> , or let me die .
you proved it , <unk> , your magic is more powerful .
you will dine with me and together we will rule egypt
i have no magic power oh , <unk> <unk> !
i have nothing but faith
but pharaoh decided to punish jews for the arrogance of his attack against <unk>
how long will you be humble ?
let my people go !
you &apos;ll be a prisoner longer <unk> the <unk> , <unk>
such is my wish , to kill those cursed <unk> !
make up your mind quickly , o pharaoh , if you want death not to fall upon you .
the sentence is <unk>
may my father forgive me , but i do not share the opinion of pharaoh .
if you were in my place , prince <unk> would you let the <unk> go ?
in any case , that would be my intention .
let everyone know that i , <unk> , will deprive my son of succession to the throne and of his rank as prince of egypt .
instead i call upon <unk> , my nephew , he has my succession .
pharaoh is dying !
it &apos;s not all lost , <unk> !
kill <unk> and take the throne in his place !
only the priests are against you because you <unk> this <unk> <unk>
<unk> , and hurry !
so you can perform your dream again , while we talk , the crown is running away .
you refuse ?
in that case , i , princess of egypt , will no longer be the wife of a lunatic finished .
you sacrificed your crown to protect my people , now you are my king forever .
while i lay ruler over your heart , o moon of israel , your love shall be my crown
the coronation of <unk> stood in the temple of <unk> and gave place to great parties before a new statue of the god .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> the heart of the city from the terrace of his house .
the people of israel are always your prisoner , o pharaoh .
may the curse fall upon egypt and let the <unk> rule the country .
you have caught me , moon of israel with your web of moonlight , and i like to be your prisoner
months of <unk> happiness and quiet <unk> in the house of <unk>
then egypt was shaken by the <unk> for a period of several months .
one after another , they fell over the country , until the people became crazy about sadness and hardship .
all these disasters - bloodshed , frogs , <unk> , flying insects , <unk> - <unk> the house of <unk> .
finally , the curse made darkness reign over the country for whole days .
bring in the <unk> sorceress .
only she can <unk> the fate that has been cast upon us .
only she can save us from this curse .
and finally came the horrible night of terror and death of the newborn
now the curse of israel has <unk> my heart and reaches our child .
all <unk> <unk> <unk> the liberation of the <unk>
let your will be done !
the hebrew slaves are free
finally , the sons of israel set their way to the red sea .
however , the fact that pharaoh would let the <unk> go , <unk> in spite of all the <unk>
do we have to look closely at the way these slaves go to <unk> against us ?
your wish shall be fulfilled , princess .
captain , assemble my wagons so that i will guide them and i will bring death to the people of israel .
the sword of death was suspended over the army of egypt .
if you want to save him , you must go .
in the camp of pharaoh <unk> , near the red sea shore
abandon the pursuit of those <unk> , pharaoh .
the black cloud above your camp will be your <unk>
i can read in your heart , traitor , <unk> by the witch <unk> .
thou <unk> a plot with the <unk> to steal my crown .
i assure you , <unk> , my cousin , you &apos;re crazy and you &apos;re playing with death .
early the next day <unk> raised the camp in pursuit of the <unk>
arrived in the waters of the red sea , the <unk> stopped , prisoners of fear .
fear nothing !
wait and see how the lord will come to our aid !
a wall of fire lies between the egyptian wagons and the children of israel .
moses held his arms toward the sea and the currents rolled into two
and the children of israel shall rule the sea by its half
the egyptians chased them to the middle of the sea
once again moses stretched his arm to the sea and the <unk> closed to the <unk>
after these events , while <unk> was still in the desert ...
your majesty , your husband sent me to escort you to him .
your life and hers <unk> and <unk> away
but <unk> &apos;s camp was far from the place he was <unk>
you have bewitched egypt .
now we will offer you in sacrifice to the wrath of the gods .
my wife , <unk> , called me in her sleep .
we must go to <unk> in a hurry
the race against death
ask jehovah to save you if he can .
now , witch , let &apos;s see if he can hear you through the flames
pharaoh <unk> lies dead in the red sea , but pharaoh <unk> <unk> lives and is here .
glory be pharaoh , king of heaven and earth !
i &apos;m dying , i &apos;m dying .
