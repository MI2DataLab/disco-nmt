if you can &apos;t trust me then i can &apos;t stay here !
darling , even if sometimes i &apos;m angry ... i love you anyway .
i just wanted to find out what terrible carelessness your husband is to leave you alone at this time of night .
how can a husband , who loves his wife , do such a thing !
i love you ... i can &apos;t help it ... nobody could !
wait ... i &apos;ll be right back .
come upstairs ... and get another cab on the phone .
don &apos;t worry ... he &apos;ll be back .
you won &apos;t come back .
i can &apos;t live without you !
professor <unk> has gone home .
josef !
i need love !
i promised to tell professor <unk> the last chess game .
1 : 10 am dr. braun and mrs. <unk> arrive in a taxi and enter the house .
1 : 15 am a light goes on in the room .
1 : 22 am the shadows disappear .
observations :
when i left at 1 : 50 am dr. braun was still there .
get your things together .
in the morning , when you can &apos;t look at the sun in your face .
go away and leave me alone ...
or i &apos;ll tell my husband !
i had a terrible dream ...
gustav was <unk> !
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening ...
when you leave me alone .
it &apos;s true ... but i give you my word , my visit was completely innocent .
i believe you , but nobody else will , and i &apos;m delighted to have a man of your stature helping me get rid of my wife .
incidentally , <unk> has been at the bristol hotel since this morning .
franz ! franz !
there &apos;s a man in this ... but who ?
franz , i suppose my husband told you everything .
why didn &apos;t you come to my house if you wanted to tell me you didn &apos;t love me ?
trust me , who is this man ?
my husband ... and my best friend !
i &apos;m innocent ... i haven &apos;t done anything .
here &apos;s the proof !
franz :
is it my fault your husband fell in love with me ?
i &apos;ll send you a copy .
the horrible end of a dreadful day .
you must speak to charlotte ... you &apos;re the only one he really trusts .
wait , franz , boy i &apos;ll teach you a lesson , so you &apos;ll never look at another woman again .
we &apos;d better go the back way .
don &apos;t apologize ... i &apos;m as guilty as you are .
gustav &apos;s kiss wasn &apos;t a dream , it was real ... in this room ... in that chair !
tell me ... didn &apos;t you come back to this room last night ?
and we don &apos;t kiss ?
half and half .
<unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>
i can die in peace because i lived a great love .
at the master &apos;s mansion .
tell mr. michael to give me my <unk> sketches .
i &apos;d like to speak to mr. <unk> .
the butler .
the princess .
<unk> , the journalist .
claude <unk> , the master .
i &apos;ve already been offered $ <unk> for these sketches , but i couldn &apos;t get away with it .
we &apos;re not going yet to sell our most beautiful memoirs .
please communicate with mr. <unk> , i shall pass again before the beginning of the opera .
still one of these russian princesses who want to be painted at all costs by the master .
do you have a monopoly on being painted by the owner ?
how did you become a master &apos;s model , and almost his son ?
four years ago ...
your sketches aren &apos;t worth anything .
come back when you &apos;ve learned to see correctly .
i &apos;d like to hear it !
would you pose for me ?
you owe him a lot , michael !
but the teacher owes him a lot too !
his glory was born from the paintings you prayed for .
at the table , conversation revolves around death .
strange , sometimes i fear death so much that i don &apos;t know how to explain it .
i keep from horror !
i &apos;m not afraid of death because with her it must be a prediction .
i can &apos;t imagine more beautiful ending than dying to be adored .
to me , death is simply the last lap of life .
do you know your conversation inspired me with a new picture ?
i &apos;m going to paint caesar killed by <unk> , his son <unk> .
and who will be <unk> ?
<unk> takes notes of our spiritual conversation for the work he writes about the master .
what was the prediction , duke , about what was spoken at the table ?
the last of <unk> will know a great happiness .
... and he will pay with his life .
the butler just announced his car is leaving .
i &apos;m sorry , i never paint an errand portraits .
but since you are , i still go to <unk> .
michael , the protector !
the princess &apos;s finance must be <unk> .
he probably hopes to increase his credit by making himself painted by the master .
but it &apos;s you !
may i come from tomorrow for the first pose ?
the <unk> is my best picture ,
i &apos;ll give it to you .
one day , everything will be fine .
never has a painting given so much pain to the master that the portrait of princess <unk>
you haven &apos;t slept for three nights !
is that reasonable ?
when i &apos;m unique , i see you take in front of me .
but when she &apos;s sitting here , everything disappears .
where &apos;s michael ?
he goes to the opera every afternoon , where he looks tenderly at a little rat .
go now , i want to work .
i &apos;ll be back after lunch .
you are guilty of my sleepless nights , princess .
serve the food , let &apos;s eat !
aren &apos;t we expecting michael ?
today we &apos;ll drink in english glass .
monsieur and madame already sat at the table .
did you sit at the table without me ?
i &apos;ve never been treated like this before .
this sound of his eyes that i can &apos;t give up .
does it look like it ?
try it , you !
yes , now , those are your eyes !
only youth can guess this .
eyes well <unk>
it was michael who painted them .
how did you know my eyes so well ?
where have you been all this time ?
unfortunately i must leave .
i &apos;m going to the theatre this afternoon .
you &apos;re the only one who suspects nothing .
speaking of michael and the <unk>
then it &apos;s her .
tell the butler to bring the english glass to my chambers .
the teacher gave me permission .
take the board , mr. michael &apos;s out .
close the window .
that afternoon , the opera ballet danced .
the lake of <unk>
don &apos;t you feel , don &apos;t you see how much i suffer ?
pity me , my friend ...
would you like to have dinner after the performance , mr. <unk> ?
go now , we &apos;ll meet soon .
i wish i could believe that eternity exists .
michael &apos;s visits to the master became increasingly rare , <unk> only by the last conscience of duty .
the thing itself is just a <unk> .
he came to ask me for a lot of money lately .
youth fully wants to live is an age where money is needed .
add this sum to my account !
from now on , you &apos;ll have your own account at my banker &apos;s .
and then you can start a new page .
now leave me alone , michael .
we could see in your last play a portrait of princess z.
no true <unk> only eyes make the exception .
the effect is so impractical that you realize that the eyes have been painted by another hand .
who knows about the history of the eyes of the <unk> ?
thee .
yes , and him ?
it takes someone to tell you the truth and the truth , it &apos;s ... you hate him since the first day .
because he forced the entrance of my life , where you wanted to be the only one to play a part .
nobody knows when i &apos;m alone .
no one has the right to increase my loneliness .
claude <unk> , i beg you ... to make yourself more miserable disappointments .
let the boy go .
no , charles , i don &apos;t want to die without my child .
why didn &apos;t you ever tell me about this ?
<unk> mercier , the art dealer .
send him in immediately .
calm down , dear .
everything &apos;s going to be all right , i found a solution .
michel &apos;s setting is in place .
to paint the country .
how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s fine , thank you .
mr. <unk> , <unk> of art objects .
i begged you to come , mr. <unk> , because i &apos;d like you to insist on selling my caesar and <unk> .
it &apos;s magnificent , but ...
how to say , at last ... an atmosphere can be <unk> , is this the way ?
and an atmosphere can be <unk>
that &apos;s the situation .
another one of your <unk> is in the market ...
the <unk> ...
i order you to rescue the <unk> .
under an alias .
i don &apos;t care about the price .
put the picture in michael &apos;s chambers , that &apos;s your place .
from that day on ,
claude <unk> closed the door to everyone to create his masterpiece in complete solitude and when it was finished ,
michael &apos;s back .
bring wine !
for heaven &apos;s sake , i was inspired by the <unk> sketches .
today , for michael &apos;s homecoming party , we &apos;ll drink in english glass .
i took them .
i &apos;ve got enough to do .
i have enough to be your model , the instrument of your glory .
i want to finally be a free man , not depend more on your good graces .
princess <unk> is asking for mr. michael on the phone .
i &apos;ll never answer what you just told me , michael .
back home .
why don &apos;t you say something ?
speak then .
what could i say , not make you suffer ?
finally came the day when the master <unk> his work .
the duchess , widow of <unk> <unk> <unk>
forgive my concern , mr. <unk> :
he &apos;s a man who has lost everything .
my child , forgive this question of a tormented mother :
do you know where my son is ?
tell alice the last <unk> paid for her happiness .
the painter of pain ... the glory of the nation ...
then calm <unk> again at the master &apos;s mansion .
unfortunately i couldn &apos;t come .
i brought the reviews .
may i introduce you ?
may i introduce you ?
everyone writes about the sky of your work is the most wonderful thing you &apos;ve ever painted .
now , i &apos;ll give you 60,000 bucks for the sketches .
in fact , where are your <unk> sketches ?
i &apos;d like very much to see you .
but mr. michael has just left ... with a big cardboard box of drawings .
<unk> has ...
it &apos;s true , however , i &apos;d forgotten ... that i offered the sketches .
yes , charles , now i &apos;m tired i &apos;d like to sleep now , sleep ...
but in the course of the night , the master &apos;s destiny is fulfilled .
the master is dying .
<unk> .
return as quickly as possible this to mr. michael .
i , claude <unk> , who knows the loneliness in this world , <unk> my last rites here .
all my assets must go to my son <unk> , <unk> michael .
was michael here ?
will he be here soon ?
mr. michael is not here for anyone .
i want to rest in the middle of the field .
where seed grows and grass grows , and no one shall know the place where it is buried .
is that why you &apos;re crying ?
jules , my friend , don &apos;t cry anymore .
i go there where the heart knows the rest .
why are you smiling , claude ?
charles , now i can die in peace .
because i knew a great love
mr. michael the master is dead !
calm down , calm down ...
i &apos;m with you .
the navigator .
our story is one of those strange jokes that sometimes fate plays .
no one would believe that the quiet lives of a boy and a girl could change for a small war between two distant countries .
gentlemen , the enemy has acquired the <unk> steamer .
there she is .
we &apos;ll drop him adrift in the fog before the crew sails .
the wind , the tide and the rocks will do the rest .
the former owner of the <unk> .
and his daughter .
the heir to fortune - a life insurance that every family should have to have to <unk> the <unk> .
i think i &apos;ll get married .
today .
send her to honolulu tomorrow on our honeymoon , buy two tickets .
you &apos;ve completed all <unk> except to warn the girl .
will you marry me ?
of course not !
i think a long walk would do me good .
your tickets , sir , and congratulations .
the ship leaves at 10 in the morning , sir .
i &apos;m not getting up so early .
going on a honeymoon without a wife is like singing <unk> &apos;s handwriting compared to alice &apos;s music , where are you ?
which pier , sir ?
pier two .
i &apos;ve got some papers to pick up at pier 12 .
anybody aboard ?
in the dark of the night , foreign agents are preparing to carry out their plans .
the next morning the <unk> is drifting .
nice time to ask me that .
i &apos;m freezing , hungry and ...
lift up the one that shines .
they &apos;re quarantine .
try to understand !
hey , wait a minute !
when they were going to say good night , they found two sailor suits .
deeply regretted
danger is near .
many brave hearts fall deeply asleep .
watch out !
weeks later , still adrift .
we found the crew in a quiet , safe place to sleep .
earth !
<unk> !
we &apos;re safer on the boat .
we &apos;re drifting towards them .
we &apos;re safe !
i &apos;ve anchored the ship .
we &apos;re sinking !
it &apos;s only a matter of time .
can you fix it ?
it should be fixed from the outside .

if you do two things at the same time don &apos;t expect both of them to work out well for you .
this is the story of a boy who tried it .
well , i was working as a film operator in a small town ... and i was also studying to be a detective .
how to be a detective .
mr detective , before you solve any mystery , you &apos;d better get busy with the movies .

and now i &apos;ll tell you where our little charm is !
and she &apos;s waiting for me there .

closed road .
i never thought you &apos;d do that .
brake on four wheels .
my father sent me to tell you that we &apos;ve made a terrible mistake .
this happened in <unk> during the reign of <unk> .
this had happened on the throne of egypt to the great rameses , who had lived 80 times the annual <unk> of the nile .
pharaoh had a daughter , <unk> , the lotus flower of love , princess ruler of egypt ruled by the gods .
he was also at the <unk> court , nephew of pharaoh .
his dark and determined air would be ambitious projects .
the heir of pharaoh was <unk> , prince of egypt , the son of the sun , <unk> to <unk> , the god with the hawk &apos;s head .
far from being blinded by power and luxury , humble and honored .
in their <unk> there were salesmen , dancers , <unk> , officers and many more than expected to see the prince .
among them was <unk> , write and poet of memphis , who sought an occasion to show his works to prince <unk> .
whoa , whoa , my <unk> !
what keeps you day after day circling around the palace halls ?
quick as the rooster <unk> a seed , thou hast taken my gold , <unk> .
take me or take me to the prince , since you are his keeper .
your heart is full of boredom , my prince .
boredom , my wise <unk> , is a disease that only cowards , some children and madmen are cured .
outside there &apos;s a writing called <unk> , thin silhouette and marked features , who claims to be his highness &apos;s twin brother , born under the same star <unk> .
<unk> , the writer ?
send him in immediately !
for countless days , o royal son of the sun , i have sought your presence to , if you will permit , write a story .
forget the praise , we &apos;re not in court , and you &apos;ve been doing your work for a long time , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
you are indeed my twin brother , ana @-@ ra , and as long as you show yourself worthy , you will not regret any of my thoughts .
the poet <unk> <unk> from now on as his secretary .
concentrate on everything .
age and worries <unk> pharaoh <unk>
<unk> , my daughter , princess sovereign of egypt , is to you , at all costs , whom i wish my succession upon the throne of egypt , and not <unk> .
or you , <unk> , <unk> son of the old dynasty .
<unk> , you must marry <unk> immediately in order that your strength leads its weakness .
<unk> likes studies , sovereign father .
he doesn &apos;t love me , his <unk> , and he doesn &apos;t like politics either .
however , the <unk> law of egypt must be respected , and the pharaoh &apos;s heir cannot marry a person of inferior rank is my last word !
let &apos;s go and watch <unk> .
i want to be your guide .
follow the prince , but do not notice .
behave yourselves !
surround the walls and the temple of <unk> and <unk> !
<unk> <unk> !
from 400 years ago the <unk> <unk> under the yoke of egyptian kingdom .
at that time he was among the <unk> moses , his prophet .
i saw the misery of my people in egypt and heard their complaints against their <unk> .
nathan &apos;s daughter , descendant of <unk> , of israel .
nathan , his father , born of a noble family of israel , a slave of egypt .
is it you they called the moon of israel before the goddess of truth ?
by jove , you &apos;re beautiful !
such beautiful hands shouldn &apos;t work making bricks .
you have to come live at my house .
i &apos;d rather be <unk> by snakes !
in the streets of <unk>
they &apos;re slaves on their way to their camp , exhausted and covered with dirt .
who are you , dog , to have the audacity to teach a pharaoh what he should do ?
i am <unk> , son of pharaoh and ruler of <unk> .
take him to the temple of <unk>
as ruler of <unk> , master of life and death , i declare the court open .
captain <unk> wanted me , who was engaged to a <unk> since childhood , to go with him to his house , and i refused him .
<unk> wanted revenge on me and he threatened to attack my father .
now , <unk> , don &apos;t shut up anything you have to say .
i deserve death , o my prince , because i struck you without knowing who you were .
but i &apos;m not to blame . don &apos;t these slaves die every day , one way or another ?
let all egyptians know that no <unk> must be killed except if he objects to our laws .
<unk>
o prince , the most fair among all , now i am forever thy servant .
officers , escort this lady to her village in <unk> country .
the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> gave the impression that the god <unk> and the goddess isis took refuge for the second time under the same heaven vault .
and that same afternoon ...
i married you , <unk> <unk> , as ordered , and as it has been ordained , i am now on my way to the country of <unk> , and <unk> , the poet , accompany me .
behind the last <unk> chain , in the middle of the desert was the country of <unk> and that &apos;s where <unk> stopped his courting .
but in the desert someone continues to seek peace .
it was <unk> , the moon of israel .
the moon of israel !
charming as the moon , mysterious as the moon !
o god of my fathers , help my poor sinful heart , who gives herself to an egyptian .
who is the happy egyptian who has won your heart , <unk> ?
it &apos;s <unk> , whom i &apos;m betrothed .
finally , they came to jabez &apos;s house , the uncle of <unk> .
why are you alone with an egyptian ?
slave , do not attack the prince of egypt .
eight full days before <unk> left <unk> country .
<unk> , i &apos;ll follow you .
captain , stay behind us with your company , without letting yourself see .
who knows what can happen in this region ?
since the day they stood before jabez &apos;s house , <unk> and <unk> had never seen each other again .
today is the day of <unk> , my prince , day of prayer in the temple for all the bishops .
perhaps it was curiosity that made the prince go to the temple ...
surely it was rather the hope of seeing <unk> again .
the <unk> tore off the veil !
he <unk> the <unk> !
<unk> the <unk> !
men of israel , have you lost your senses ?
will you bring pharaoh &apos;s wrath upon us ?
jehovah will protect us !
get out of here to the <unk> and <unk> !
my friends , if i have offended your god , it was not my intention .
please , you &apos;re crazy !
if jehovah is offended shouldn &apos;t he rather take vengeance on the prince himself ?
be calm , let the judgment of god speak .
if this man &apos;s heart is evil , he shall die .
if nothing happens to him , let him go in peace .
i beg you , o prince , leave this country as soon as possible , your life is in danger .
i was looking for adventure and found nothing but a little setback .
at dusk , the prince &apos;s chariot reached the pass of the <unk> mountains , on the border of <unk> country .
murderers !
turn around , prince <unk> !
turn around !
they lay an ambush on you .
run as ever and alert the guards !
i thank my god for saving you , my prince .
and thus <unk> found refuge against the wrath of his people in the palace of <unk> .
the moon of israel is not a traitor .
she will protect her people from pharaoh &apos;s vengeance .
<unk> de <unk> , god of war !
i thought you &apos;d kill a poet and look !
i found a soldier !
fate <unk> a strange bond around us .
how could i thank you for saving my life , moon of israel ?
forgive me if in my happiness to see you safe , i spoke too much since you are the prince of egypt and i alone the moon of israel , your slave .
is this the <unk> you brought from the country of <unk> ?
our <unk> led me to you .
prince hikaru loves you , <unk> .
only you can draw the sword from israel &apos;s heart .
o prince of egypt , i appeal to thee protects my people from death by the sword of pharaoh .
and i thee wed , my husband , deliver his people to the sword that has deserved .
<unk> , god of all the gods , release the children of israel that i have betrayed !
thou <unk> that jehovah is greater than the great gods of egypt .
pray to your temple and i shall ask my god to perform a miracle in front of <unk> @-@ <unk> .
if he does not hear me , the priests of <unk> will want revenge on me for the <unk> .
the battle of the gods at the temple of <unk> .
don &apos;t worry .
the gods of egypt defy this <unk> .
oh , amon @-@ ra !
father of the gods , listen to your priest and servant .
this woman of israel defies you .
she places her god taller than you and asks you to kill him if possible .
lord of life and terror , show thy power and cast this girl on earth and her false god .
jehovah , god of my fathers , give a signal to this idol , <unk> , or let me die .
you proved it , <unk> , your magic is more powerful .
join me and together we will rule egypt .
i have no magic power o <unk> !
i have nothing but faith .
but pharaoh decided to punish jews for the arrogance of his attack against <unk> .
how long will you refuse to be humble ?
let my people go !
<unk> prisoner longer <unk> the <unk> , <unk>
such is my wish , to kill those damned <unk> !
decide quickly , o pharaoh , if thou wilt not die upon thee .
the sentence is <unk> .
may my father forgive me , but i do not share the opinion of pharaoh .
if you were in my place , prince <unk> would you let the <unk> go ?
in any case , that would be my intention .
let everyone know that i , <unk> , shall deprive my son of succession to the throne and rank of prince of egypt .
instead i claim <unk> , my nephew , has my succession .
pharaoh dies !
it &apos;s not all lost , <unk> !
kill <unk> and take the throne instead !
only the priests are against you because they <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , and quick !
so you can perform your dream again , while we speak , the crown is running away from you .
you refuse ?
in that case , i , princess of egypt , shall not be for more time the wife of a madman who is finished .
thou hast sacrificed thy crown to protect my people , now thou art my king forever .
while i proclaim sovereign above thy heart , o moon of israel , thy love shall be my crown .
the coronation of <unk> stood in the temple of <unk> and gave place to great parties before a new statue of the god .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> the heart of the city from the terrace of his house .
the people of israel are always your prisoner , o pharaoh .
may the curse fall upon egypt and may the <unk> rule the country .
thou hast caught me , moon of israel with thy web of moonlight , and i like to be thy prisoner .
months of <unk> happiness and quiet <unk> in <unk> &apos;s house .
then egypt was shaken by the <unk> for a period of several months .
one after another , they fell upon the country , until the people became crazy about sadness and hardship .
all these disasters - bloodshed , frogs , <unk> , flying insects , <unk> - <unk> the house of <unk> .
finally , the curse made darkness reign over the country for days and days .
bring in the <unk> sorceress .
only she can deny us the fate she has been cast upon us .
only she can save us from this curse .
and finally came the horrible night of terror and death of the newborn .
now the curse of israel has lifted my heart and reached our child .
all the <unk> <unk> the liberation of the <unk>
thy will be done !
the hebrew slaves are free .
finally , the sons of israel set their way towards the red sea .
however , the fact that pharaoh would let the <unk> depart , <unk> in spite of everything to the <unk> .
shall we watch closely how these slaves leave to rebel against us ?
your wish shall be fulfilled , princess .
captain , gather my wagons so that i guide them and be the death of the people of israel .
the sword of death was suspended over the army of egypt .
if you want to save him , you must leave .
in the camp of pharaoh <unk> , near the banks of the red sea .
abandon the pursuit of those barbarians , pharaoh .
the black cloud above your camp will be your <unk>
i can read in your heart , traitor , <unk> by the witch <unk> .
thou <unk> a plot with the <unk> to steal my crown .
i assure you , <unk> , my cousin , you &apos;re crazy and you &apos;re playing with death .
early the next day <unk> raised the camp in pursuit of the <unk> .
arrived in the waters of the red sea , the <unk> stopped , prisoners of fear .
fear nothing !
wait and see how the lord will come to our aid !
a wall of fire lies between the egyptian carts and the sons of israel .
moses spread his arms towards the sea and currents spread in two .
and the sons of israel shall rule the sea by its half .
the egyptians chased them to the middle of the sea .
once again moses spread his arm towards the sea and the <unk> closed to the <unk> .
after these events , while <unk> was still in the middle of the desert ...
your majesty , your husband sent me to escort you to him .
your life and his life <unk> and <unk> away .
but <unk> &apos;s camp was far from the place he was <unk>
you have bewitched egypt for its ruin .
now we shall offer you in sacrifice to the wrath of the gods .
my wife , <unk> , has called me in her dreams .
we must go to <unk> in a hurry .
the race against death .
ask jehovah to save you if he can .
now , witch , let &apos;s see if he can hear you through the flames .
pharaoh <unk> lies dead in the red sea , but pharaoh <unk> <unk> lives and is here .
glory be pharaoh , king of heaven and earth !
i &apos;m dying , i &apos;m dying .

since then , the slightest incident took , for the poor child , <unk> proportions .
a tender affection <unk> <unk> and her sister , mrs. <unk> .
my wife &apos;s character becomes intolerable , makes life impossible for this poor girl ...

maurice went back to his house in a strange affliction .
the next morning ...

catherine returned to <unk> , hoping to find work .
mrs. <unk> had become chairman of the works help the <unk> .
the night came , catherine had been everywhere .
why did you leave my sister &apos;s house ?
i didn &apos;t leave , they threw me out .
i &apos;ve been so unhappy .

not knowing where to turn , i went to the garage .
there &apos;s only room for honest girls here , mrs. <unk> answered me .
... and my husband wants me to keep that girl in my house .
i &apos;d rather go home to my mother .
mrs. <unk> &apos;s mother .
<unk> went , from that moment on , prey to hypocrisy , hatred , envy ...
<unk> can no longer be the candidate of honest people .
my life is impeccable , and without stain .
the election campaign began .
i am accused of not taking over my command any longer ...
i took , in my charge , 50,000 francs in repairs at the <unk> .

catherine , i had never been so happy in <unk> &apos;s secretary .
after a few days of vacation , the prefect himself had moved to his post .
i will consent to withdraw my <unk> if <unk> calls my sister again and throws that girl out of her house if she refuses , <unk> , because such conduct is a scandal for our regime .
if <unk> refuses , my dear <unk> , we &apos;ll <unk> his <unk> .

the 5 : 30 trolley .
two tramps looking for a bad blow .
it &apos;s time the switch of needles was made over the cliff .

catherine accepted her destiny ...
several kilometers of earring were going to broadcast a great speed .
the hand brake ... the hand brake ...
the last earring .
... and the tram was <unk> and it was only because of its <unk> speed .
but catherine , <unk> , was allowed to drag herself to death .
