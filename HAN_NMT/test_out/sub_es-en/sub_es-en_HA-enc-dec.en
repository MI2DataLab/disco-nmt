if you don &apos;t believe me ...
if you can &apos;t trust me then i can &apos;t stay here !
darling , even if , sometimes i &apos;m angry ... i love you anyway .
i just wanted to find out what terrible carelessness your husband is to leave you alone at this time of night .
how can a husband , who loves his wife , do such a thing !
i love you ... i can &apos;t help it ... nobody could !
wait ... i &apos;ll be right back .
come upstairs ... and get another taxi on the phone .
don &apos;t worry ... he &apos;ll be back .
you won &apos;t come back .
i can &apos;t live without you !
professor <unk> has gone home .
josef !
i need love !
i promised to tell professor <unk> the last chess game .
1 : 10 am dr. braun and mrs. <unk> arrive in a taxi and enter the house .
1 : 15 am a light goes on in the room .
1 : 22 am the shadows disappear .
observations :
when i left at 1 : 50 am dr. braun was still there .
get your things .
in the morning , when one can &apos;t look at the sun in the face .
go away and leave me alone ...
or i &apos;ll tell my husband !
i had a terrible dream ...
gustav was <unk> !
that &apos;s what happens ...
when you leave me alone .
it &apos;s true ... but i give you my word , my visit was completely innocent .
i believe you , but nobody else will , and i &apos;m delighted to have a man of your stature helping me to get rid of my wife .
incidentally , <unk> has been at the bristol hotel since this morning .
franz ! franz !
there &apos;s a man in this ... but who ?
franz , i suppose my husband told you everything .
why didn &apos;t you come to my house if you wanted to tell me you didn &apos;t love me ?
trust me , who is this man ?
my husband ... and my best friend !
i &apos;m innocent ... i didn &apos;t do anything .
here &apos;s the proof !
franz :
is it my fault your husband fell in love with me ?
i &apos;ll send you a copy .
the horrible end of a dreadful day .
you must talk to charlotte ... you &apos;re the only one he really trusts .
wait , franz , boy i &apos;ll teach you a lesson , so you &apos;ll never look at another woman again .
we &apos;d better go the back way .
don &apos;t apologize ... i &apos;m as guilty as you are .
gustav &apos;s kiss wasn &apos;t a dream , it was real ... in this room ... in that chair !
tell me ... didn &apos;t you come back to this room last night ?
and we didn &apos;t kiss ?
half and half .
<unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk>
i can die in peace because i lived a great love .
at the master &apos;s mansion .
tell mr. michael to give me my <unk> sketches .
i &apos;d like to speak to mr. <unk> .
the butler .
the princess .
<unk> , the journalist .
claude <unk> , the master .
i &apos;ve already been offered $ <unk> for these sketches , but i couldn &apos;t get away with it .
we &apos;re not going yet to sell our most beautiful memoirs .
please contact mr. <unk> , i &apos;ll be back before the beginning of the opera .
still one of these russian princesses who want painted at all costs to be painted by the master .
do you have a monopoly on the owner ?
how did you become a master &apos;s model , and almost his son ?
four years ago ...
your sketches are worthless .
come back when you &apos;ve learned to see correctly .
i &apos;d like to hear it !
can you pose for me ?
you owe him a lot , michael !
but the teacher owes him a lot too !
his glory was born from the paintings you prayed for .
at the table , the conversation turns around death .
it &apos;s strange , sometimes i &apos;m so afraid of death that i don &apos;t know how to explain it .
i keep from horror !
i &apos;m not afraid of death because with her it must be a prediction .
i can &apos;t imagine more beautiful ending than dying to be adored .
to me , death is simply the last stage of life .
do you know that your conversation inspired me with a new picture ?
i &apos;m going to paint caesar killed by <unk> , his son <unk> .
and who will look like <unk> ?
<unk> takes notes of our spiritual conversation for the work he writes about the master .
what is the prediction , duke , what was said at the table ?
the last of <unk> will know a great happiness .
... and he will pay with his life .
the butler just announced his car is leaving .
i &apos;m sorry , i never paint <unk> .
but since you are , i still go to <unk>
michael , the protector !
the princess &apos;s finance must be <unk> .
he probably hopes to increase his credit by making himself painted by the master .
but it &apos;s you !
may i come tomorrow for the first pose ?
the <unk> is my best picture ,
i &apos;ll give it to you .
one day , everything will be fine .
never was a painting so painful to the master that the portrait of princess <unk>
you haven &apos;t slept for three nights !
is that reasonable ?
when i &apos;m alone , i see you take in front of me .
but when she &apos;s sitting here , everything disappears .
where &apos;s michael ?
he goes to the opera every afternoon , where he looks tenderly at a little rat .
go now , i want to work .
i &apos;ll be back after lunch .
you are guilty of my sleepless nights , princess .
serve the food , let &apos;s eat !
aren &apos;t we expecting michael ?
today we &apos;ll drink in english glass
monsieur and madame already sat at the table .
did you sit at the table without me ?
i &apos;ve never been treated like this before .
this sound of his eyes that i can &apos;t give up
does it look like it ?
try it , you !
yes , now , those are your eyes !
only youth can guess this
eyes well <unk>
it was michael who painted them .
how did you know my eyes so well ?
where have you been all this time ?
unfortunately i must leave .
i &apos;m going to the theater this afternoon .
you &apos;re the only one who suspects nothing .
about michael and the <unk>
then it &apos;s her .
tell the butler to bring the english glass to my quarters .
the master gave me permission .
take the board , mr. michael &apos;s out .
close the window .
that afternoon , the opera ballet danced .
the lake of <unk>
don &apos;t you feel , don &apos;t you see how much i suffer ?
pity me , my friend ...
would you like to have dinner after the performance , mr. <unk> ?
go now , we &apos;ll meet soon .
i wish i could believe that eternity exists .
michael &apos;s visits to the master became increasingly rare , <unk> only by the last conscience of duty .
the thing in itself is just a <unk>
he came to ask me for a lot of money lately .
youth fully wants to live is an age where money is needed .
charge this sum to me !
from now on you &apos;ll have your own account at my banker &apos;s .
and then you can start a new page
now leave me alone , michael .
we could see in your last play a portrait of princess z.
no true <unk> only the eyes make the exception .
the effect is so little realistic that you realize that the eyes have been painted by another hand .
who knows about the history of the eyes of the <unk> ?
thee
yes , and him ?
it takes someone to tell you the truth and the truth , it &apos;s ... that you hate him from the first day .
because he forced the entrance of my life , where you wanted to be the only one to play a part .
nobody knows when i &apos;m alone .
no one has the right to increase my loneliness .
claude <unk> , i beg you ... to make yourself more miserable disappointments .
let the boy go
no , charles , i don &apos;t want to die without my child .
why didn &apos;t you ever tell me about this ?
<unk> mercier , the art dealer .
send him in immediately .
calm down , my dear .
everything &apos;s going to be all right , i found a solution .
michel &apos;s place is covered .
to paint in the country .
how &apos;s it going ?
it &apos;s all right , thank you .
mr. <unk> , <unk> of art
i begged you to come , mr. <unk> , because i &apos;d like you to insist on selling my caesar and <unk>
it &apos;s magnificent , but ...
how to say , at last ... an atmosphere can be <unk> , is this the way ?
and an atmosphere can be <unk>
such is the situation .
another one of your <unk> is in the market ...
the <unk> ...
i order you to rescue the <unk>
under a pen name
i don &apos;t care about the price .
put the picture in michael &apos;s quarters , that &apos;s your place .
from that day on ,
claude <unk> closed the door to everyone to create his masterpiece in complete solitude and when it was finished ,
michael &apos;s back .
bring some wine !
for heaven &apos;s sake , i inspired the <unk> sketches .
today , for michael &apos;s party , we &apos;ll drink in english glass .
i took them .
i &apos;ve got enough to do .
i have enough to be your model , the instrument of your glory .
i want to finally be a free man , not depend on your good graces any more .
princess <unk> is asking for mr. michael on the phone .
i &apos;ll never answer what you just told me , michael .
back home .
why don &apos;t you say something ?
speak .
what could i say , not make you suffer ?
it came at last the day when the master <unk> his work .
the duchess , widow of <unk> <unk>
forgive my concern , mr. <unk> .
he &apos;s a man who &apos;s lost everything .
my child , forgive this question of a tormented mother :
do you know where my son is ?
tell alice that the last <unk> paid for her happiness
the painter of pain ... the glory of the nation ...
then the calm <unk> again at the master &apos;s mansion .
unfortunately i couldn &apos;t come .
i brought the reviews
may i introduce you ?
can i help you ?
everyone writes about the sky of your work is the most wonderful thing you &apos;ve ever painted .
now , i &apos;ll give you $ 60,000 for the sketches .
in fact , where are your <unk> sketches ?
i &apos;d like very much to see you .
but mr. michael has just left ... with a big cardboard box of drawings .
<unk> has ...
it &apos;s true , however , i &apos;d forgotten ... that i offered the sketches .
yes , charles , i &apos;m tired now i &apos;d like to sleep now , sleep ...
but in the course of the night , the master &apos;s destiny is fulfilled .
the master is dying .
<unk> .
return this as quickly as possible to mr. michael .
i , claude <unk> , who knows the loneliness in this world , <unk> my last rites here .
all my assets must go to my son <unk> , <unk> michael .
is michael here ?
will he be here soon ?
mr. michael is not for anyone .
i want to rest in the middle of the field .
where the seeds grow and the grass grows , and no one shall know the place where it is buried .
is that why you &apos;re crying ?
jules , my friend , don &apos;t cry anymore .
i go there where the heart knows the rest
what are you smiling at , claude ?
charles , now i can die in peace .
for i knew a great love
mr. michael the master is dead !
calm down , calm down ...
i &apos;m with you .
the navigator .
our story is one of those strange jokes that sometimes fate plays .
no one would believe that the quiet lives of a boy and a girl could change for a small war between two small and far countries .
gentlemen , the enemy has acquired the <unk> steamer .
there it is .
we &apos;ll drift him adrift in the fog before the crew sails .
the wind , the tide and the rocks will do the rest .

of course not !
i think a long walk would do me good .

a brilliant man , always attentive to the bad elements .
this is a detective .
when he &apos;s dead , i &apos;ll put him there .
and now i &apos;ll tell you where our little charm is !
and she &apos;s waiting for me there .
be careful or one of us will get hurt .
closed road .
i never thought you &apos;d do that .
brake on four wheels .
my father sent me to tell you that we &apos;ve made a terrible mistake .
this happened in <unk> during the reign of <unk> .
this had happened on the throne of egypt to the great rameses , who had lived 80 times the annual <unk> of the nile .
the pharaoh had a daughter , <unk> , the lotus flower of love , princess ruler of egypt , ruled by the gods .
he was also at court <unk> , nephew of pharaoh .
his dark , determined air , ambitious projects .
the heir of pharaoh was <unk> , prince of egypt , the son of the sun , <unk> to <unk> , the god with the hawk &apos;s head .
far from being blinded by power and luxury , humble and honored .
in their <unk> were salesmen , dancers , dancers , <unk> , officers and many more than expected to see the prince .
among them was <unk> , write and poet of memphis , who sought an occasion to show his works to prince <unk> .
whoa , whoa , my <unk> !
what &apos;s keeping you day after day , circling around the palace rooms ?
quick as the cock <unk> a seed , you took my gold , <unk> .
take me or take me to the prince , since you are his keeper .
your heart is full of boredom , my prince .
boredom , my wise <unk> , is a disease that only cowards , some children and madmen are cured .
outside there &apos;s a writing called <unk> , thin silhouette and marked features , who claims to be his highness &apos;s twin brother , born under the same star <unk> .
<unk> , the writer ?
send him in immediately !
for countless days , o royal son of the sun , i have sought your presence to , if you will permit , write a story .
forget the praise , we &apos;re not in court , and you &apos;ve been doing your work for a long time , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
you are indeed my twin brother , ana @-@ ra , and show yourself worthy , do not <unk> any of my thoughts .
the poet <unk> <unk> from now on as his secretary .
<unk> everything .
age and worry <unk> pharaoh <unk>
<unk> , my daughter , sovereign princess of egypt , is to you , at all costs , to whom i wish my succession on the throne of egypt , and not to <unk> .
or you , <unk> , <unk> son of the old dynasty
<unk> , you must marry <unk> immediately in order that your strength may guide his weakness .
<unk> likes studies , my lord father .
he doesn &apos;t love me , his <unk> , and he doesn &apos;t like politics either .
however , the <unk> law of egypt must be respected , and the pharaoh &apos;s heir cannot marry a person of lower rank is my last word !
let &apos;s go and watch <unk> .
i want to be your guide .
follow the prince , but do not notice .
be good !
surround the walls and the temple of <unk> and <unk> !
<unk> <unk> !
since 400 years ago the <unk> <unk> under the yoke of egyptian kingdom .
at that time he was among the <unk> moses , his prophet .
i saw the misery of my people in egypt and heard their complaints against their <unk> .
nathan &apos;s daughter , descendant of <unk> , of the people of israel .
nathan , his father , born of a noble family of israel , a slave of egypt .
is it you they called the moon of israel before the goddess of truth ?
by jove , you &apos;re beautiful !
such beautiful hands shouldn &apos;t work making bricks .
you have to come live at my house .
i &apos;d rather be <unk> by snakes !
in the streets of <unk>
they are slaves on their way to their camp , exhausted and covered with dirt .
who are you , dog , to have the audacity to teach a pharaoh &apos;s officer what to do ?
i am <unk> , son of pharaoh and ruler of <unk>
take him to the temple of <unk>
as ruler of <unk> , master of life and death , i declare the court open .
captain <unk> wanted me , who was engaged to a <unk> since childhood , went with him to his house , and i refused him .
<unk> wanted to take revenge on me and he threatened to attack my father .
now , <unk> , don &apos;t shut up anything you have to say .
i deserve death , o my prince , because i hit you without knowing who you were .
but i &apos;m not to blame . don &apos;t these slaves die every day , one way or another ?
let all egyptians know that no <unk> must be killed except if he objects to our laws .
<unk>
o prince , the most fair among all , i am now forever your servant .
officers , escort this lady to her village in the country of <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> gave the impression that the god <unk> and the goddess isis took refuge for the second time under the same heaven vault .
and that same afternoon ...
i married you , <unk> <unk> , as ordered , and as it has been ordained , i am now on my way to the country of <unk> , and <unk> , the poet , accompany me .
behind the last <unk> chain , in the middle of the desert was the country of <unk> and that &apos;s where <unk> stopped his courting .
but in the desert someone keeps looking for peace .
it was <unk> , the moon of israel
the moon of israel !
charming as the moon , mysterious as the moon !
o god of my fathers , help my poor heart of sinful , who gives himself to an egyptian .
who is the happy egyptian who has won your heart , <unk> ?
it &apos;s <unk> i &apos;m engaged to
finally , they came to jabez &apos;s house , the uncle of <unk> .
why are you alone with an egyptian ?
slave , do not attack the prince of egypt .
eight full days before <unk> left the country of <unk> .
<unk> , i &apos;ll follow you .
captain , stay behind us with your company , not let yourself be seen .
who knows what can happen in this region ?
since the day they stood before jabez &apos;s house , <unk> and <unk> had never seen each other again .
today is the day of the <unk> , my prince , day of prayer in the temple for all the <unk>
perhaps it was curiosity that made the prince come to the temple ...
no doubt it was rather the hope of seeing <unk> again .
the <unk> tore off the veil !
he <unk> the <unk> !
<unk> the <unk> !
men of israel , have you lost your senses ?
will you bring pharaoh &apos;s wrath upon us ?
jehovah will protect us !
get out of here to the <unk> and <unk> !
my friends , if i have offended your god , it was not my intention .
please , you &apos;re crazy !
if jehovah is offended , shouldn &apos;t he take vengeance on the prince himself ?
don &apos;t worry , let the judgment of god speak .
if this man &apos;s heart is evil , he will die .
if nothing happens to him , let him go in peace .
i beg you , o prince , leave this country as soon as possible , your life is in danger .
i was looking for adventure and found nothing but a little setback .
at dusk , the prince &apos;s chariot reached the pass of the <unk> mountains , on the border of <unk> country .
the murderers !
turn around , prince <unk> !
turn around !
they lay an ambush on you .
run like never and alert the guards !
i thank my god for saving you , my prince .
and that &apos;s how <unk> found refuge against the wrath of his people in the palace of <unk> .
the moon of israel is not a traitor .
she will protect her people from pharaoh &apos;s vengeance .
<unk> of <unk> , god of war !
i thought you &apos;d kill a poet and look !
i found a soldier !
fate <unk> a strange bond around us .
how could i thank you for saving my life , moon of israel ?
forgive me if in my happiness to see you safe , i spoke too much since you are the prince of egypt and i alone the moon of israel , your slave .
is this the <unk> you brought from the country of <unk> ?
our <unk> has led me to you .
prince hikaru loves you , <unk> .
only you can draw the sword from israel &apos;s heart .
o prince of egypt , i appeal to thee to protect my people from death by the sword of pharaoh .
and i thee wed , deliver his people to the sword that has deserved .
<unk> , god of all the gods , release the children of israel that i have betrayed !
let us say that jehovah is more powerful than the great gods of egypt .
send me to your temple and i shall ask my god to perform a miracle in front of <unk> @-@ <unk> .
if he does not hear me , the priests of <unk> will want revenge on me for the <unk>
the battle of the gods at the temple of <unk>
don &apos;t worry .
the gods of egypt defy this <unk>
oh , amon @-@ ra !
father of the gods , listen to your priest and servant .
this woman of israel defies you .
she places her god taller than you and asks you to kill him if possible .
lord of life and terror , show your power and cast this girl on earth and her false god .
jehovah , god of my fathers , make a signal to this idol , <unk> , or let me die .
you proved it , <unk> , your magic is more powerful .
you will dine with me and together we will rule egypt .
i have no magic power .
i have nothing but faith .
but pharaoh decided to punish jews for the arrogance of his attack against <unk> .
how long will you refuse to be humble ?
let my people go !
<unk> prisoner longer <unk> the <unk> , <unk>
such is my wish , to kill those damn <unk> !
make up your mind quickly , o pharaoh , if you want death not be upon you .
the sentence is <unk>
may my father forgive me , but i do not share the opinion of pharaoh .
if you were in my place , prince <unk> would you let the <unk> go ?
in any case , that would be my intention .
let everyone know that i , <unk> , <unk> my son from succession to the throne and his rank as prince of egypt .
instead i claim <unk> , my nephew , he has my succession .
pharaoh dies !
it &apos;s not all lost , <unk> !
kill <unk> and take the throne instead !
only the priests are against you because you <unk> this <unk> <unk>
<unk> , and quick !
so you can perform your dream again while we talk , the crown is running away .
you refuse ?
in that case , i , princess of egypt , will no longer be the wife of a madman who is finished .
you sacrificed your crown to protect my people , now you are my king forever .
while i proclaim ruler over your heart , o moon of israel , thy love shall be my crown .
the coronation of <unk> stood in the temple of <unk> and gave place to great parties before a new statue of the god .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> the heart of the city from the terrace of his house .
the people of israel are always your prisoner , o pharaoh .
may the curse fall upon egypt and let the <unk> rule the country .
you have caught me , moon of israel with your web of moon @-@ rays , and i like to be your prisoner .
months of <unk> happiness and quiet <unk> in the house of <unk>
then egypt was shaken by the <unk> for a period of several months .
one after another , they fell over the country , until the people became mad about sadness and hardship .
all these disasters - bloodshed , frogs , <unk> , flying insects , <unk> - <unk> the house of <unk> .
finally , the curse made darkness reign over the country for whole days .
bring in the <unk> sorceress .
only she can tell us the fate she has been cast upon us .
only she can save us from this curse .
and finally came the horrible night of terror and death of the newborn
now the curse of israel has broken my heart and reached our child .
all the <unk> <unk> the liberation of the <unk>
let thy will be done !
the hebrew slaves are free
finally , the sons of israel set their way to the red sea .
however , the fact that pharaoh would let the <unk> go , <unk> in spite of everything to the <unk> .
do we have to watch <unk> how these slaves leave to rebel against us ?
your wish shall be fulfilled , princess .
captain , gather my wagons so that i will guide them and be the death of the people of israel .
the sword of death was suspended over the army of egypt .
if you want to save him , you must leave .
in the camp of pharaoh <unk> , near the banks of the red sea .
abandon the pursuit of those <unk> , pharaoh .
the black cloud above your camp will be your <unk>
i can read in your heart , traitor .
thou <unk> a plot with the <unk> to steal my crown .
i assure you , <unk> , my cousin , you &apos;re crazy and you &apos;re playing with death .
early the next day <unk> raised the camp in pursuit of the <unk> .
arrived in the waters of the red sea , the <unk> stopped , prisoners of fear .
fear nothing !
wait and see how the lord will come to our aid !
a wall of fire lies between the egyptian carts and the children of israel .
moses spread his arms to the sea and currents spread in two
and the children of israel shall rule the sea by his half .
the egyptians chased them to the middle of the sea
once again moses spread his arm to the sea and the <unk> closed to the <unk>
after these events , while <unk> was still in the middle of the desert ...
your majesty , your husband sent me to escort you to him .
your life and hers <unk> and you escaped
but <unk> &apos;s camp was far from the place he was <unk>
you have bewitched egypt for its ruin .
now we will offer you in sacrifice to the wrath of the gods .
my wife , <unk> , called me in her sleep .
we must hurry to <unk> .
the race against death .
ask jehovah to save you if he can .
now , witch , let &apos;s see if he can hear you through the flames .
pharaoh <unk> lies dead in the red sea , but pharaoh <unk> <unk> lives and is here .
glory be pharaoh , king of heaven and earth !
i &apos;m dying , i &apos;m dying .
catherine ( a life without joy )
<unk> , little <unk> @-@ <unk>
this is merely the story of catherine <unk> , cleaning ...

orphan , for several years .
catherine <unk> was the kitchen girl at the <unk> &apos;s .
one game worth another .
go to the <unk> @-@ <unk> , you &apos;ll see the lady , and ask her for the keys to my office .
why in these great forests i like to lose myself , to mourn there .
i want to see mrs. <unk> .

france and the administration !
you shouldn &apos;t cheat , you , a captain of <unk> .
here &apos;s twenty francs .
give me nineteen francs and eighty , come on .
everyone has made fun of me at the <unk> @-@ <unk> .
georges <unk> remembered catherine since she was very sweet , sensitive , intelligent , catherine suffered from moral isolation which her condition led him to live .
since then , the slightest incident took , for the poor child , <unk> proportions .
a tender affection for <unk> and his sister , mrs. <unk> .
my wife &apos;s character becomes intolerable , makes life impossible for this poor girl ...
do you want to take her home ?
winter came and in the rain , the little town turned even <unk> .
mr. maurice needs sun .
we &apos;ll find him in nice , catherine .
carnival evening
catherine , mr. maurice is very unhappy , he &apos;s very ill , he may not spend the winter .
maurice wanted to , too , to live on this false one , but to enjoy the carnival nights .
my dear , forgive me for holding you up , but i &apos;m driving with some old friends .
a hug , henriette de <unk> .
maurice went back to his house in a strange affliction .
the next morning ...
the family , taking advantage of mrs. <unk> &apos;s grief , <unk> her tyranny over the poor child .
enough comedy , child , this shame is abnormal and indecent .
you &apos;re leaving immediately .
you understand ...
let &apos;s go .
old nice .
handsome adolphe , bookmaker , generous day to day , and so on .
i tell you , miss , i have a <unk> hotel , not expensive , and all modern conveniences .
you &apos;re too young , handsome adolphe is ashamed of you .
if one day you find <unk> , take adolphe down .
the souls of god of <unk> had created the work help to <unk>
believe me , my dear , this species ...
... with a man ... in a hotel !
room <unk> two weeks late ... 90 francs a week overdue ... 45 francs .
total ... <unk> francs if you don &apos;t pay today , the door of your room will be locked and your belongings , <unk> .
and if i want to give you credit , i do !
thanks to a currency <unk> by a thread the cunning played on safety .
a clever man who , thanks to his invention , made a very good living .
adolphe suddenly understood why the machine lost 150 francs a day .
in the morning , i was already in saint @-@ paul maurice <unk> in a small field cemetery .
catherine returned to <unk> , hoping to find work .
mrs. <unk> had become chairman of the works help the <unk>
the night came , catherine had been everywhere .
why did you leave my sister &apos;s house ?
i didn &apos;t leave , they threw me out .
i &apos;ve been so unhappy .
everywhere i met , i was denied the job .
not knowing where to go , i went to the workshop .
there &apos;s only room for honest girls here , mrs. <unk> answered me .
... and my husband wants to force me to keep that girl in my house .
i &apos;d rather go back to my mother &apos;s .
mrs. <unk> &apos;s mother .
<unk> was , from that moment on , prey to hypocrisy , hatred , envy ...
<unk> can no longer be the candidate of honest people .
my life is impeccable and without stain .
the election campaign began .
i am accused of not taking care of my term ...
i &apos;ve taken , in my charge , 50,000 francs for repairs .
the interest of the country must make me forget that i &apos;m your brother @-@ in @-@ law .
i have responded to the call of my fellow citizens .
i &apos;ll be brief ...
yes , citizens , voting for me is to vote for france ...
i have exposed my program to you , pray for me .
grave , leaving everything dark , i hoped to compromise the success of your opponent .
catherine , i had never been so happy in <unk> &apos;s secretary .
after a few days of vacation , the prefect himself had moved to his post .
i will consent to withdraw my <unk> if <unk> calls my sister again and throws that girl out of her house if she refuses , <unk> , because such conduct is a scandal for our regime .
if <unk> refuses , my dear <unk> , we &apos;ll <unk> his <unk> .
my dear fellow , we &apos;ve come to see you about miss <unk> .
the presence of miss <unk> in your house is a scandal to our little town , my dear congressman , and it will be impossible for the party to support your <unk> if mrs. <unk> stays away from home .
no doubt , you &apos;re going to dismiss this intriguing little girl .
you tried to read in your big eyes you looked at , tender drunkenness ...
all my love , like a <unk> <unk> , lies in this <unk> .
i feel too much gratitude and admiration for you to be an obstacle to your happiness and your political career .
i &apos;m leaving .
my dear <unk> , we have the pleasure of <unk> your choice .
catherine was on an abandoned tram .
my dear fellow , wait until tomorrow to start your search .
when miss <unk> left , there was no tram or train .
catherine was still asleep at dawn .
since the first <unk> of the day , <unk> went to seek catherine .
the 5 : 30 trolley .
two tramps looking for a bad blow .
it &apos;s time for the switch on the cliff .
so , did you get the tram there ?
catherine accepted her destiny ...
several kilometers of <unk> were about to broadcast a great speed .
the hand brake ... the hand brake ...
the last earring .
... and the tram was <unk> and it was only because of its <unk> speed .
but catherine , <unk> , let her crawl to death .
in a dream , two beings , who understand each other , leave far away ... far away ... for the country of oblivion and tenderness .
