if you won &apos;t believe me ...
if you can &apos;t trust me then i can &apos;t stay here !
dear , even if i am cross something i love you just the same .
i merely wanted to prove how frightfully careless your husband is to leave you alone in the dead of the night
how can a husband , who loves his wife , neglect her so !
i love you ... i just can &apos;t help it ... nobody could !
wait ... i &apos;m going back with you .
come upstairs ... and phone for another taxi .
don &apos;t worry ... he &apos;ll come back .
you will not go back .
i cannot live without you !
prof. stock has gone home .
josef !
i need love !
... i promised to tell prof. stock the result of the last chess game .
1 : 10am dr. braun and mrs. stock arrive in taxi and enter house .
1 : 15am a light is turned on in the room .
1 : 22am shades are pulled down .
remarks :
when i left the house after 1 : 50am dr. braun was still there .
pack your things .
then the morning , when one can &apos;t look the sun in the face .
get out and leave me in peace ...
or i &apos;ll tell my husband !
i had a terrible dream ...
gustav was kissing me !
that &apos;s what happens ...
when you leave me alone .
that is true ... but i give you my word my visit was entirely innocent .
i believe you ... but nobody else will and i &apos;m delighted to have a man of your standing help me get rid of my wife .
by the way , mizzi is at the hotel bristol ... since this morning .
franz !
there &apos;s a man in this ... but who ?
i suppose my husband has told you everything well , it &apos;s all your fault that i &apos;m in this desperate situation why did you come to my house at all if you merely wanted to tell me that you did not love me ?
... if you are not here by 10 o &apos;clock i shall call at your office .
confide in me ... who is this man ?
my husband ... and my best friend !
i &apos;m innocent ... i &apos;ve done nothing ...
here is the proof !
i suppose my husband has told you everything well , it &apos;s all your fault that i &apos;m in this desperate situation why did you come to my house at all if you merely wanted to tell me that you did not love me ?
is it my fault that your husband fell in love with me ?
i &apos;ll mail you a copy .
the dreaded end of a dreadful day .
you must talk to charlotte ... you are the only one in whom she has perfect confidence .
wait , franz , my boy ... i &apos;ll teach you a lesson so you &apos;ll never look at another woman .
we had better go in the back way .
don &apos;t ask my forgiveness ... i &apos;m as guilty as you .
gustav &apos;s kiss was no dream ... it was real in this room ... in that very chair !
tell me ... didn &apos;t you return to this room last night ?
and didn &apos;t we kiss each other ?
fifty @-@ fifty .

i can die peacefully because i seen a great love .
in the masters &apos; house .
tell mr. michael to bring my algerian sketches to me .
i would like to speak with mr. zoret
the butler .
the princess .
switt , the journalist .
claude zoret , the master .
already i have been offered 30000 dollars for these sketches , but i could not bring myself , to let go of them .
we are not going thus to sell our most beautiful memories .
please , tell mr. zoret , i will return again before the beginning of the opera .
so , one of these russian princesses whom at all costs love to be painted by the master .
have they for instance a monopoly on being painted by the master ?
how come you were made a model by the master , and almost his son ?
it was four years ago ...
these sketches are not worth anything
come back when you have learned to see correctly .
i would like to paint to you !
would you model for me ?
you owe much to him , michael !
but the master also must thank you !
his glory was born on the paintings in which you modelled .
at table , the conversation turns to death .
it is strange how , sometimes i fear dying so much that i do not know like thinking of it .
i run away from the horror !
i do not fear death because prediction must be fulfilled
i cannot imagine a more beautiful end than to die for being adored
for me , death is simply the last stage of life
you know that your conversation has inspired in me a new picture ?
i want to paint caesar assassinated by brutus , his adoptive son .
and who will look like brutus ?
switt takes notes from our table conversation for the work that he is writing on the master
what is your prediction , duke , of what was spoken at table ?
that the last monthieu will know a great happiness
... and will pay with his life
the butler announces to them that the carriage is leaving
i regret much , i never paint pictures to order
but since there is time i am nevertheless going to paint to you
michael , the spotlight !
the finances of the princess must be rather disordered
possibly she hopes to increase her credit by being painted by the master .
there we are !
i can come in the morning for the first pose ?
the winner is my best picture ,
i give it to you
there will come a day when all will belong to you
never had a picture given as much pain to master as the picture of princess zamikow
you have been up three nights without sleeping !
is that sensible ?
when i am alone , i see it in front of me , it goes well
but when she is seated here , everything vanishes
where is michael ?
he goes every afternoon to the opera to ogle a young ballerina .
go now , i want to work
i will return after food
you are the culprit of my sleepless nights , princess
serve the food , we will eat !
we do not wait for michael ?
today , we will drink in english glasses
the gentleman and the lady are already seated at table
you have sat down to eat without me ?
never have i been treated thus before
it is your eyes i cannot render them
it looks right ?
you try !
yes , now , those are her eyes !
only the youth can guess that
good eyes
it was michael who painted them
how did you knew my eyes so well ?
where have you been throughout this time ?
unfortunately i must leave
i go to the theater this evening .
you are the only one that does not suspect to anything
with regard to michael and zamikow
ah so
tell the butler to take the english glasses to my apartment
the master gave permission
take away the board , mr. michael has gone out .
close the window
on this evening , the ballet danced
tchaikovski &apos;s swan lake
you do not feel , do not see what i suffer ?
have pity on me , my friend ...
do you desire to have supper with us after the performance , mr. switt ?
go now , we meet soon
i want only to believe that the eternity exists .
the visits of michael to the master were made more and more rarely only dictated by the last conscience of having to
the thing itself is just a triviality
he came to request lately to me large amounts of money several times
youth wants to live totally and youth costs money
book this sum to my account !
from now on you will have your own account with my banker .
and then you will be able to begin a new page
now leave me alone , michael
we could see in its last work a picture of princess z.
no brush stroke truer only the eyes make an exception .
the effect is so unrealistic that we would swear that the eyes have been painted by another hand
who knows the story of the eyes of the zamikow ?
us
yes , and he ?
perhaps that to somebody he says the truth and the truth to you , is ... that you hated him from first day
because he broke into my life , where you wanted to be the only one that played a role
nobody knows when i am unique
nobody has the right to increase to my solitude
claude zoret , i request to you ... that you save the bitterer deceptions .
let go of the boy
no , charles , i do not want to die without my boy .
why you spoke to me never of this ?
call mercier , the art dealer
that passes immediately
calm yourself , my darling
everything is going to fix itself , i found a solution .
leave michael &apos;s place setting
painting in the country .
how is she ?
she is well , thanks
mr. leblanc , art dealer
i requested that you came , mr. leblanc , because i would like through you to sell my caesar and brutus
that is gorgeous , but ...
how to say , i mean ... an atmosphere can be cool , not true ?
and atmosphere can be warm
so in this situation
another one of your canvases is on the market ...
the conqueror ...
i want to rescue the conqueror
under a pseudonym
the price little concerns me
put the picture in the appartment of michael , that is its place .
as of that day ,
claude zoret closed the door to everybody to create his masterpiece completely alone and when this was finished ,
michael returned .
bring wine !
for the sky , i have been inspired by the algerian sketches
today , for the celebration of return of michael , we will drink in english glasses
i have borrowed them
i have enough of you pretending
i have enough of being your model , the instrument of your glory
i want finally to be a free man , not to depend anymore on your good thanks
princess zamikow asks for mr. michael to the telephone .
i will never respond to you to what you &apos;ve just said to me , michael .
the homecoming ....
why you do not say anything ?
speak then
what could i say , that does not make you suffer ?
finally came the day in which the master exposed his work .
the duchess , widow of monthieu wilhelmine sandrock
pardon my preoccupation , mr. zoret :
that is a man who has lost all
my girl , pardon this question of a tormented mother :
do you know where is my son ?
tell alice that the last monthieu has paid for his happiness
the painter of the pain ... the glory of the nation ...
soon calm reigned again in the mansion of the master .
i am sorry i could not come ,
i have brought the criticism with me
i can read it for you ?
i can read it for you ?
all write about the sky of your work is the most wonderful thing that you have ever painted
now , we propose to you 60000 dollars for the sketches
to the fact , where are your algerian sketches ?
i would much like to see them again
but mr. michael has just left .. with a large folder of drawings
possibly he has ...
is true nevertheless , i had forgotten ... that i gave the sketches to him
yes , charles , now i am tired i want to sleep now , to sleep ...
but in the course at night , the fate of the master is fulfilled .
the master is dying .
switt .
take this as fast as is possible to mr. michael
i , claude zoret , that knows the solitude in this world , i will my last dispositions here
all my goods must go to my adoptive son , eugène michael .
have you found michael ?
is he coming soon ?
mr. michael will not be spoken to
i want to rest in the middle of a field
where germinate the seeds and grows the grass , and nobody will have to know the place where i am buried ,
swear that for me ?
jules , my friend , do not cry more .
i go where my heart will know rest
why you smile , claude ?
charles , now i can die peacefully .
because i knew a great love
mr. michael , the master has died !
be quiet , be still ...
i am with you .

our story deals with one of those queer tricks that fate sometimes plays .
nobody would believe , for instance , that the entire lives of a peaceful american boy and girl could be changed by a funny little war between two small countries far across the sea . the spies of the two little nations were at a pacific seaport , each trying to prevent the other getting ships and supplies .
gentlemen , the enemy have just purchased the steamship navigator .
there she lies now , and it is our patriotic duty to destroy that ship .
we will send her adrift in the fog tonight before the new crew goes aboard . -
- the wind - the tide - and the rocks will do the rest .
the wealthy ship owner who has just sold the navigator . ( actor : fredrick vroom )
( actress : kathryn maguire )
- heir to the treadway fortune - a living proof that every family tree must have its sap . ( actor : buster keaton )
i think i &apos;ll get married .
today .
we &apos;ll sail for honolulu tomorrow on our honey @-@ moon - get two tickets .
he had completed all arrangements - - except to notify the girl .
will you marry me ?
certainly not !
i think a long walk would do me good .
your tickets , sir - - and congratulations .
the boat sails at ten in the morning , sir .
i don &apos;t get up that early - so i &apos;ll go aboard tonight .
going on a honeymoon without a bride is like singing the words of kiss me again to the music of alice , where art thou .
what pier , sir ?
pier two .
i must get some papers off the navigator , so stop at pier 12 .
is there any one on board ?
under the cover of darkness the foreign agents prepared to carry out their plans .
the next morning found the navigator drifting helplessly at sea .
this is a fine time to ask me that .
i &apos;m cold and hungry and - -
put up that bright one .
she &apos;s quarantined .
try and catch them !
hey ! wait a minute !
by the time they were ready to say good @-@ night they had found a couple of sea @-@ going tuxedos .
asleep in the deep - wilfred glenn
danger is near thee -
many brave hearts are asleep in the deep -
beware
weeks later - still drifting .
we now find the crew with a safe and quiet place to sleep .
land !
cannibals !
we &apos;re safer on the boat .
we &apos;re drifting toward them .
we &apos;re safe !
i &apos;ve anchored the ship .
we are sinking !
it &apos;s just a matter of time until we &apos;re captured .
can &apos;t you fix it ?
that would have to be fixed from the outside .

kriemhild &apos;s revenge
canto i
how kriemhild mourned over siegfried and how king attilla woos her through his ambassador , ruediger von bechlam .
king gunther , margrave ruediger von bechlam asks for an audience .
i come as ambassador of king attilla , who is called lord of the earth .
he seeks the hand of kriemhild , your sister , in marriage .
i am afraid king attilla does not know whom he woos .
in the name of siegfried who was murdered and whose murder lives !
bear in mind how siegfried died !
king attilla sends me , lady kriemhild , to plead in his stead for your hand !
ruediger , you seem to know quite well how i am exposed to grievous wrongs in the house of my clan !
where is your brother siegfried ?
my king , deliver to me the murderer of my husband !
he has kept faith with me , i shall keep faith with him .
this , kriemhild , is my last word !
margrave ruediger , lady kriemhild wishes to speak with you after evensong !
now is the time to keep close watch over our burgundy , gerenot !
tell me all about king attilla , ruediger !
you are wooing a dead woman , ruediger .
the murderer of my husband flaunts the green sparkling sword he robbed from the dead !
if somebody , my lady , would do you wrong at attila &apos;s court , king attilla shall know how to avenge you !
lord margrave , swear that to me in king attilla &apos;s name and yours !
not on the cross , lord margrave - on the sharp edge of your sword !
lord hagen has robbed the nibelungen treasure !
you have my word , margrave ruediger !
hagen tronje , where is the treasure ?
the loyal hagen speaks : at a place , my lady , where no one can use the gold to forge weapons against the kings of burgundy !
here ends the first canto .
canto ii
how kriemhild takes leave from her homeland , and how she was received by king attilla .
earth , you were once soaked with siegfried &apos;s blood . one day i shall come and drench you with the blood of hagen tronje !
i shall return !
rest assured , i &apos;ll come back !
my daughter , don &apos;t you want to bid farewell to your brother gunther ?
you travel far , lady kriemhild . don &apos;t you want to make peace with your family ?
no , my priest .
don &apos;t you want to greet them one last time , my lady ?
no , ruediger .
when kriemhild reached the country of the huns , spring had come to the land .
the sack of gold is mine !
the queen is coming !
let us meet her , brother !
the king &apos;s treasure !
my lady , king attilla &apos;s brother , blaodel , welcomes you !
ruediger , choose a kingdom from my lands in gratitude for this wondrous woman !
ask king attilla , margrave ruediger , if he is ready to make your oath his own !
by my head , o queen - whoever dares to offend you , shall die a hundred deaths !
here ends the second canto .
canto iii
how king attilla besieged rome and how kriemhild summoned her brothers .
lord attilla swore to turn rome &apos;s churches into horse stables ! why does he not fulfill his oath ?
we went into war !
why don &apos;t we ride on ?
why is attilla &apos;s horse tethered to his tent ?
and when king attilla his mount bestrode it was the world over which he rode and when he paused his whip to crack the world cried out
- woe , woe , alack what deeds are now in his mind ?
what is in the mind of our king ?
he sleeps ! he sleeps !
lord attilla , attilla sleeps !
the white woman stole and bound our lord !
she uses golden tresses as cord !
my lord- !
kriemhild ...
my lord- !
kriemhild has borne you a son !
o sacred earth !
a wish - have you no wish i can fulfill ?
if you would honor me and gladden my heart , then bid my brothers as guests to your court .
leave for worms , blaodel , to invite the royal brothers of my wife as guests to our court !
here ends the third canto .
canto iv
how kriemhild receives her brothers .
for over a month your brothers stayed as guests of ruediger von bechlarn .
the minstrels sing a new song about the love between your brother giselher , and ruediger &apos;s only child , the beautiful dietlind !
thus bechlam and burgundy are bound together : one heart , one life , one death !
to honor your brothers , lord attilla has sent the noblest of his knights , dietrich von bern , to greet them .
once more , dear nibelungen , before lord attilla comes to greet you : do not forget to whom attilla will lead you !
how could we forget , lord , that we come to visit our sister , kriemhild ?
whoever wants to win my gratitude , must remember my great sorrow !
on the day before summer solstice the nibelungen arrived at attilla &apos;s court .
you must be tired from your journey .
refresh yourselves and rest .
tomorrow we will celebrate the summer solstice in a very special way .
king attilla , remember your oath !
he who murdered siegfried is now in your hands ! remember my suffering !
can you never forget lord siegfried , woman ?
hagen tronje shall duel with me for his life !
you would fight an assassin , attilla ?
no , have him killed !
my guest ?
remember you oath , attilla !
it &apos;s all your fault ...
dear mr. macbright , after thinking over your offer , i have come to the conclusion that for a poor , young woman like myself , scrupules are a luxury .
zina vessenina .
the work of macbright &apos;s new secretary consists of translating his correspondance .
dear mr. macbright , after thinking over your offer , i have come to the conclusion that :
please will you forgive me .
the cause of all this is my love for you .
can you really blame me ?
what a disgusting hypocrite !
and she &apos;s written to the american for an interview .
get away from me you venal creature ...
dear mr. macbright , after thinking over your offer , i have come to the conclusion that :
life &apos;s long road continues on its way .
if one &apos;s not working in the movies , being a street photographer isn &apos;t such a bad way of life
keep still .
mister macbright suggests that you forget you &apos;re an actress , and asks you not to make a scene .

they &apos;ve killed zina !
they &apos;ve just taken the trunk to the station .
open that trunk .
there &apos;s a body inside .
it wasn &apos;t worth the bother of bringing all those mannequins ,
moscow has its own models .
they &apos;ve taken the trunk .
a fine detective , you &apos;d make .
how could you even think that the representative of a foreign prêt @-@ à @-@ porter company would want to kill his own models ?
you &apos;ve ruined my whole life , you and your imbecilic love .
tell mr. macbright that i don &apos;t wish to work for him any more .
my life is in tatters !
why are you so heartless .
do you want to spoil everything about our love ?
you probably don &apos;t love me , or even know what love is !
why did you seduce me ?
why , force me to love you ?
you probably don &apos;t know how much it hurts , my broken heart .
mr. mityushin , i require you to do me a great service .
i would be extremely grateful if you would present yourself immediately at my residence .
oliver macbright .
i need your skills as a translator in a rather delicate matter .
it is of very great importance for me
you will receive 100 dollars , and if everything goes according to plan , 1,000 more .
the important but delicate concern of oliver macbright ...
please , could you tell miss zina that i am asking for her hand in marriage .
i am flattered , but i &apos;m not ready for marriage .
she refused him .
tell her that what i shall treasure most on my long journey home are the fondest memories of her .
d &apos;you know what he said ?
it &apos;s her who seduced me because she was only after my money , and i &apos;ve seen through her little game .
any mail for mr. macbright should be forwarded to :

i &apos;m sorry , my boy , ... but we never want to see you in this house again .
rule 5 . shadow your man closely .
as a detective he was all wet , so he went back to see what he could do to his other job .
can you describe the man who pawned this watch ?
veronal film co .
presents :
hearts and pearls
some one has stolen the pearls .
he is sending for the world &apos;s greatest detective , sherlock jr . !
the crime @-@ crushing criminologist
sherlock jr .
don &apos;t bother to explain , this is a simple case for me .
pardon , sir .
i think there is something in your drink .
by the next day the master mind had completely solved the mystery ... with the exception of locating the pearls and finding the thief .
his assistant :
gillette .
a gem who was ever @-@ ready in a bad scrape .
that &apos;s a detective .
when he &apos;s dead i &apos;ll put you in there .
and now i &apos;ll tell you where our little sweetie is this minute !
and she &apos;s waiting there for me .
be careful or one of us will get hurt .
street @-@ closed .
i never thought you &apos;d make it .
four wheel brakes .
father sent me to tell you that we &apos;ve made a terrible mistake .
this happened in tanis during meremptah &apos;s reign .
this happened on the throne of the pharaohs of egypt , to the great ramses , who had lived 80 times the length of time of the annual nile flood .
the pharaoh had a daughter , userti , the lotus flower of love , sovereign princess of egypt , cherished by the gods .
the nephew of the pharaoh , amenmesés , was also at court .
his gloomy air betrayed his ambitious projects .
the heir to the pharaoh was prince seti , the son of the sun , entrusted with horus , the falcon @-@ headed god .
far from being blinded by power and luxury , he remained humble and honest .
merchants , dancers , jugglers , officials and many more waited to see the prince .
among them was ana , writer and poet of memphis , who was looking for an opportunity to show his work to prince seti .
so , so , what can i bring you ?
what do you want day after day going around in circles in the halls of the palace ?
i spend my gold as quickly as a rooster bites a seed , pambasa .
return my money or take me to the prince , because you are his chamberlain .
your heart is full of boredom , my prince .
boredom , my wise pambasa , is a disease of which only cowards , some children and madmen are exempt .
outside there is a young man , called ana , with a slim silhouette and features , who purports to be the twin brother of his highness , born under the same configuration of stars .
ana , the writer ?
show him in immediately !
for countless days , oh , royal son of the sun , i have searched for you and will , if you permit me , to dedicate my story to you .
forget the praise , we are not at court , and i have known about your work for a long time , learned ana .
you are in effect , my twin brother , ana @-@ ra , and if you show yourself worthy , i will not hide any of my thoughts from you .
the poet , ana , is engaged to begin immediately as my secretary .
obey him in everything .
age and concerns overwhelm the pharaoh meremptah
userti , my daughter , princess sovereign of egypt , it is to you , at all cost , that i wish to leave the throne of egypt , and not to seti
or you , amenmesés , venerable son of the ancient dynasty
userti , you must marry seti immediately so that your strength will guide his weakness .
seti likes his studies , sovereign father
he does not love me , his stepsister , nor does he like politics .
however , the ancestral law of egypt must be respected , and the heir of the pharaoh may not marry a person of lower rank it &apos;s my last word !
let &apos;s think of tanis .
i want to be your guide .
follow the prince , but without being seen .
guard him carefully !
look at the walls and the temple of amun and ptah !
the israelite slaves have rebuilt it !
400 years ago the hebrews were placed under the yoke of the egyptian kingdom
at the time moses , their prophet , was found among the israelites
i saw the misery of my people in egypt and heard their complaints against their oppressors .
merapi , the daughter of nathan , descendant of levi , of the people of israel
nathan , his father , born of a noble family of israel , but a slave in egypt
is it you who is called the moon of israel before the goddess of truth ?
by maat , you &apos;re beautiful !
such beautiful hands should not work making bricks .
you must come to live in my house
i would rather pet a snake !
in the bustle of the streets of tanis
the israelites are slaves of path going to his camp , exhausted and covered with dirt
who do you think you are , dog , to have the audacity to tell an officer of the pharaoh what to do ?
i am seti , the son of the pharaoh and the sovereign of tanis
take him to the steps at the temple of amon
as the ruler of tanis , with the power of life and death , i declare the court open
captain khuaka wanted me , but i have been promised to an israelite since childhood . he wanted me to go with him to his house , but i refused him .
khuaka wanted revenge on me and he punished me by attacking my father
now , khuaka , what do you have to say ?
i deserve death , oh , my prince , because i struck you without knowing who you were .
but i didn &apos;t do anything wrong . don &apos;t these slaves die every day , one way or another ?
don &apos;t all egyptians know not to kill any of the israelites , unless they break our laws .
take him away !
oh , prince , you are the most just among us . i am now and will forever remain your servant .
officer , escort this lady to her people in the country of goshen
at the betrothal of seti and userti , one had the impression that the god osiris and the goddess isis were married for the second time under the same sky
and that same evening ...
i married you , queen userti , as i was ordered and just as i was ordered i am presently en route to the country of goshen , and ana , the poet , accompanies me
behind the last mountain chain , in the middle of the desert , was the country of goshen and this is where seti held his court .
but someone in the desert was seeking peace .
it was merapi , the moon of israel
the moon of israel !
charming as the moon , mysterious as the moon !
oh , god of my fathers , come to the aid of my poor , sinful heart , which i have given to an egyptian .
who is the happy egyptian who has won your heart , merapi ?
it is laban , who i promised to marry
finally , they arrive at the home of jabez , merapi &apos;s uncle
why are you alone with an egyptian ?
slave , you will not be permitted to attack a prince of egypt
8 full days elapsed before seti left the country of goshen
go now . i will follow you later .
captain , stay behind us with your company , and don &apos;t be seen .
who knows what may happen in this region ?
from the day they were before the house of jabez , seti and merapi had not seen each other again
today is the day of the sabbath , my prince , on the day of prayer . all the hebrews go to temple today .
perhaps it was curiosity that made the prince go to the temple ...
no doubt it was rather the hope of returning there to see merapi
the egyptian has parted the veil !
he has desecrated the tabernacle !
kill the blasphemer !
men of israel , have you lost your senses ?
do you want to incur the wrath of the pharaoh against us ?
the lord will protect us !
drag the egyptian out of here and stone him !
my friends , if i have offended your god , it was not my intention
please , you are crazy !
if the lord is offended , should he not rather take revenge on the prince himself ?
be quiet , let the judgment of god speak for itself .
if the heart of this man is evil , he will die .
if nothing happens , let him go in peace .
i beg you , o prince , flee this country as soon as possible . your life is in danger .
i was looking for adventure and just found a small misadventure .
at dusk , the prince &apos;s chariot reached the gorge of the rocky mountains , on the border of country of goshen
there go the murderers !
turn back , prince seti !
turn back !
an ambush awaits you !
run quickly and alert the guards !
i thank god that you have saved my prince
and so merapi found peace from the wrath of her people in the palace of tanis
the moon of israel is not a traitor .
she will protect her people from the revenge of the pharaoh
menthu , god of war , protect us ! god of querre !
i thought we had found a poet and seer !
we found instead a soldier !
destiny weaves a strange rope around us .
how can i thank you enough for saving my life , oh moon of israel ?
forgive me if i am happy enough to see you safe . i spoke , too , because you are the prince of egypt and i am merely the moon of israel , your slave .
is this the judaism that has brought the country of goshen ?
our distress led me to you .
prince seti loves you , merapi .
only you can divert the sword from the heart of israel
oh , prince of egypt , i appeal to you to protect my people from death by the sword of pharaoh
and i warned you , my husband , to surrender her people to the sword that they have earned
jehovah , god of all gods , i have betrayed the god of the children of israel !
do you believe that the lord is more powerful than the great gods of egypt ?
so be it .
if he does not listen to me , the priests of amon @-@ ra will want revenge on me by my desecration
the battle of the gods in the temple of amon
do not be concerned .
the gods of egypt will annihilate this blasphemous god
oh , amon @-@ ra !
father of the gods , listen to your priest and servant
this woman from israel challenges you .
she puts her god higher than you and asks you to kill it if you can
lord of life and terror , show your power and miss by land this girl and its false god
jehovah , god of my fathers , direct a signal at this idol , amon , or let me die
you &apos;ve shown , jewess , that your magic is more powerful .
share it with me and together we will reign over egypt
i have no magical power oh , kheheb ki !
i have nothing but faith
but the pharaoh decided to punish the jews for their arrogance in their attack on seti
how long will you refuse to humble yourself ?
let my people go !
in keeping them prisoner longer and longer you are provoking a catastrophe , meremptah
that is my wish , kill those jews !
decide quickly , oh pharaoh if you do not want death to hang over you
the verdict is pronounced
let my father forgive me , but i do not share the view of the pharaoh
if you were in my place , prince seti , would you let the hebrews go ?
in any case , that would be my intention
let all the world know that i , meremptah , disinherit my son , seti , from succession to the throne and remove him from the rank of prince of egypt
in his place i name amenmeses , my nephew , to be my successor
the pharaoh is dying !
not everything is lost , seti !
kill amenmeses and occupy the throne in his place !
only the priests are against you because you protect that devil of an israelite .
act , and quickly !
then you can realize your dreams because while you are speaking , you are letting the crown escape .
would you refuse ?
in this case , i , princess of egypt , will not be much longer the wife of a crazy person
you &apos;ve sacrificed your crown to protect my people , now you are my king forever
so long as i reign sovereign in your heart , oh , moon of israel , your love will be my crown .
the coronation of amenmeses took place in the temple of amon and was followed by great feasts , before a new statue of the god .
seti and merapi watched the heart of the city from the terrace of their house
the people of israel are always your prisoner , oh , pharaoh
let the curse fall on egypt and let plagues devastate the country
the moon of israel has tied me with her thread woven of moonlight , and i love being her prisoner
months of happiness passed , and tranquility reigned in the house of seti
egypt was then shaken by disasters during a period of several months .
one after another befell the country , until the people were mad from sadness and deprivation
all these disasters - rain blood , frogs , rodents , flying insects , epidemics -- but all avoided the house of seti .
finally , the curse covered the country in darkness for entire days
bring me to the israelite sorceress .
she can avert the misfortune that has been cast upon us .
she alone can save us from this curse
and finally came the horrible night of terror and death of the newborns
now the curse of israel has pierced my heart and reached our child .
all the egyptians cried out against the liberation of the israelites
let your will be done !
the hebrew slaves are free
finally , the children of israel came on the road to the red sea
however , the fact that the pharaoh let the hebrews go was irritaging despite the assent of all the egyptians .
must our army look on impassively while these slaves leave , leading the syrians against us ? let pharaoh respond !
your wish will be fulfilled , princess .
captain , assemble my chariots so that i may lead and i will become the death of the people of israel .
the sword of death was suspended over the army of egypt .
if you want to save it , you should leave .
in the camp of the pharaoh amenmeses , near the shore of the red sea
abandon your pursuit of these hebrews , pharaoh .
the black cloud over your camp will be your shroud
i read in your heart , traitor , sighing for the sorceress of israel .
you are preparing a plot with the hebrews to steal my crown .
i assure you , amenmeses , cousin of mine , you &apos;re crazy and you &apos;re playing with death .
early the next day amenmeses broke camp in pursuit of the hebrews
having reached the waters of the red sea , the israelites stopped , seized by fear .
do not fear anything !
wait and see how the lord will come to our aid !
a wall of fire rose between the egyptian chariots and the children of israel
moses spread his arms toward the sea and the current was split into two
and the children of israel crossed the sea in its place
the egyptians pursued them to the middle of the sea .
moses again extended his arms toward the sea and the flows were closed engulfing the egyptians
after these events , while seti was in the desert ...
your majesty , your husband sends me to take you to him .
your life is threatened and you must flee
but seti &apos;s camp was far from the place where she was lead .
you &apos;ve bewitched egypt to its ruin .
now we are going to offer you as a sacrifice to the gods who have been betrayed .
my wife , merapi , called to me in a dream .
we must go to tanis quickly
the race against death .
ask jehovah to save you if he can .
now , witch , see if he can hear you through the flames .
the pharaoh , amenmeses , lies dead in the red sea , but the pharaoh seti meremptah lives and is here
glory to the pharaoh , king of the heavens and the earth !
i am dying , i am dying . oh , hold me strong , my king , my husband , my beloved !
catherine a joyless life
varance , a little sub @-@ prefecture
this is only the simple story of catherine ferrand , a ward .
every sunday evening , the sub @-@ prefect received guests .
the keeper of mortgages and the venomous grave were concerned with no one .
look at maurice laisne , the poor fool ...
for three years his mother has been trying to marry him off .
my daughter is still very young , madame .
gedeon grave and his wife , relatives of mallet .
let &apos;s wait . believe me , later on , i can &apos;t say ...
georges mallet , mayor , councillor , and deputy ... preferred his home to foolish evenings at the sub @-@ prefecture .
orphaned several years before ,
catherine ferrand worked as a scullery maid in the mallet home .
one turn deserves another .
go to the sub @-@ prefecture . find madame , and ask her for the keys to my office .
why in this great wood do i love to wander and weep ... to wander and weep ?
i would like to see madame mallet .
where is madame mallet ?
to wander and weep .
the stampede .
edith , a yes would leave your suitor in bliss . a yes , i beg you , or else , in spite of my zeal ,
i &apos;ll leave both france and the civil service !
you shouldn &apos;t cheat a captain of the constabulary .
here &apos;s 20 francs .
give me back 19 francs 90 , if you please .
everyone laughed at me at the sub @-@ prefecture . madame told me off .
georges mallet saw catherine in every child ... gentle , sensitive , and intelligent , catherine suffered from the moral isolation in which her position forced her to live .
from this moment , the smallest incident took catastrophic proportions for the poor girl .
a tender affection bound mallet to his sister madame laisne .
my wife is becoming impossible . she makes catherine &apos;s life unbearable .
could you take her in ?
winter came ... and under the rain , the provincial village became even more dreary .
catherine , m. maurice needs some sun .
we &apos;ll take him to nice .
carnival night
catherine , m. maurice is unhappy . he &apos;s very ill . i &apos;m afraid he won &apos;t last the winter .
maurice too wanted to live in the false but exuberant gaiety of carnival nights .
my darling , forgive me for having stood you up , but i &apos;m leaving by car with some old friends .
see you soon . kisses , henriette de beaulieu
maurice returned home plagued by a strange malaise .
the next morning .
the family , taking advantage of madame laisne &apos;s grief , were happy to exercise their tyranny on a poor child .
enough of this comedy .
your grief is abnormal and indecent . you &apos;re leaving immediately .
understand this :
you must leave .
old nice .
handsome adolphe , bookie , small lender , etc. etc ...
i tell you , miss , i &apos;ve got a hotel of furnished rooms ... they &apos;re not expensive , and have all the modern comforts .
you &apos;re too young . handsome adolphe feels sorry for you .
if ever you need help , just ask adolphe : he won &apos;t hold any grudges .
the good souls of varance had created the foundation aid for the young .
would you believe , my dear , this creature
was with a man ... in a hotel ?
two weeks late 90 francs this week 45 francs
if you haven &apos;t paid this evening , your door will be locked , and your belongings will be kept in security .
and what if i want to give her credit ?
thanks to a coin with a hole in the middle , held by a thread , the scoundrel never lost .
a devil who , thanks to his invention , earned a good living .
adolphe suddenly understood why the machine lost 150 francs a day .
catherine escaped by the road to varance .
catherine returned to varance , hoping to find work .
madame mallet was president of the foundation aid for the young .
when night fell , catherine had been rejected everywhere .
why did you run away from my sister &apos;s house ?
i didn &apos;t run away , i was thrown out .
i &apos;ve been very unhappy .
everywhere i went , i was refused work .
not knowing where to go , i went to the workroom .
madame mallet told me there &apos;s only room for honest girls .
and my husband wants to force me to keep this girl in my house .
i prefer to return to my mother &apos;s .
madame mallet &apos;s mother
from then on , mallet was beset with hypocrisy , hate , and jealousy .
mallet can no longer be the candidate of honest men .
my life is irreproachable ... and without stain .
the electoral campaign began .
i &apos;m accused of no longer concerning myself with my mandate .
i &apos;ve spent 50,000 francs of my own money for gutter repairs .
the region &apos;s interests make me put aside that i &apos;m your brother @-@ in @-@ law .
i &apos;ve responded to the appeal of my fellow citizens .
i will be brief ...
yes citizens , vote for me , it &apos;s ... a vote for france ...
i &apos;ve shown you my program . vote for me . long live france .
grave , in turning out the lights , hoped to compromise the success of his adversary .
catherine , now mallet &apos;s secretary , had never been so happy .
after several days of perfect vacation , the sub @-@ prefect resumed his post .
i &apos;ll consent to withdraw my candidacy if mallet takes back my sister and throws this girl out of the house . if he refuses , i will persist , for such conduct is a scandal for our government .
my dear grave , if mallet refuses , we &apos;ll support your candidacy .
my dear friend , we &apos;ve come to see you about mlle. ferrand .
the presence of mlle. ferrand in your home is a scandal to our village , mr. deputy ... and it will be impossible for the party to support your candidacy if madame mallet remains away .
without a doubt , he &apos;s going to remove this little schemer .
essay to read in your large eyes dear looks much more langorous , intoxication sweet of being two ...
the love i bear , like a humble poodle heels at your feet , quiet as a puzzle .
i &apos;ve too much gratitude and admiration for you to be an obstacle to your happiness and your career . i &apos;m leaving .
farewell , catherine
my dear grave , we &apos;ve the pleasure to announce that we &apos;re supporting your election .
catherine sought refuge in an abandoned streetcar .
my dear friend , wait until tomorrow to look for her .
when mlle. ferrand left there were neither streetcars nor trains . so she is still in varance .
dawn broke ... and catherine was still sleeping .
from the first light of day , mallet began searching for catherine .
the 5 : 30 streetcar .
two vagabonds looking to cause trouble .
this is the time when they switch on the precipice .
so , shall we give the streetcar a push ?
catherine accepted her fate .
several kilometers downhill gave the streetcar an incredible speed .
the hand brake ...
the final descent .
and the streetcar slowed down little by little advancing no more than its acquired speed .
but catherine , unconscious , let herself be dragged to her death .
two people who understand each other , go on a long journey to the land of oblivion and tenderness .
