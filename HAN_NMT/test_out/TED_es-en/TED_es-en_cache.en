one day , the l.a. times <unk> was walking around the streets of los angeles , when he heard a beautiful music .
she came from a man , a lovely , goofy man , hard @-@ face man , no home , playing a violin that only had two strings .
i &apos;m telling you a story that a lot of you know about , because steve &apos;s column was the basis for a book that then became a film , with robert <unk> , acting like steve <unk> and jamie <unk> , who was trained in <unk> , whose promising career was blessed by a tragic <unk> of schizophrenia .
nathaniel <unk> , he suffered a complete and 30 years later he was living on the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles .
i encourage you to read steve &apos;s book , or look at the film to understand not only the beautiful bond that was created between these two men , but how music helped to shape that link , and finally played a critical role to help nathaniel out the streets .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
he just heard an interpretation of the first and fourth symphony of beethoven and came behind the stage to show .
i was talking in a very imaginative way about yo @-@ yo @-@ yo ma and hillary hillary , and how the eiffel tower never would come to the world , all because of the <unk> performance of the first violin game in the last sentence of the fourth beethoven .
and we talk about music , and a few days later , i got an electronic mail saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , i have to mention that nathaniel denies the treatment , because when he was treated by taking shock therapy , <unk> and wives , and that scar has remained his whole life .
but as a result now , it &apos;s being prone to these schizophrenics , the worst <unk> can be measured with him exploding and then disappearing for days , <unk> by the streets of skid row , exposed to his <unk> , with the <unk> of his own mind without control .
and nathaniel was in such a state of turbulence when we started our first lesson in the walt disney hall , who had a kind of flash , leaning in his eyes , he was lost .
and i was talking about the invisible demons and the smoke , and how someone was sleeping it .
and i felt afraid , not for me , but fear that i was going to lose it , that i was going to sink in one of their states and that i would discuss their relationship with the violin if i started talking about scale and develop and other ways of pedagogy <unk> for the violin .
so i just started playing .
and i touched the first move of beethoven &apos;s violin .
and as i felt that a profound change was happening in nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if i was under control of some unseen drug , a chemical reaction , for which i played music was its catalyst .
and cholera that was transformed into understanding , in a sit curiosity and in grace .
and as a miracle , he raised his own violin , and he began to touch some clips of concerts for fiddle , which then asked me to join him , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , from bach all the way to beethoven and brahms , <unk> , all the <unk> , all the way down to that <unk> @-@ <unk> .
and i understood that he didn &apos;t only have a <unk> of music , but he would marry this music at a personal level .
he talked about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man transformed from the really paranoid man , who had come from walking the streets of the center of los angeles to the lovely , brilliant , educated musician in <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and his delusions and turn through his imagination and his creativity actually .
and this is an escape from their state .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the real reason why we make music , that we took something that exists inside all of us , in our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we are able to transform those emotions in reality .
and the reality of that expression hits us all , moves us , and it inspires us and binds us .
and for nathaniel , the music brought him back to the group of friends .
the <unk> power of music went back to the family of musicians who understood it , who recognized their talents and respected him .
and i always will make music with nathaniel , whether we &apos;re in the walt disney hall , or on skid row , because he reminds me of why i became a music player .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that without any embarrassment of <unk> .
so please excuse me .
so i &apos;ve met a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve only loved two .
the first was more like a passionate romance .
it was a beautiful , tasty fish , with texture , <unk> , a <unk> in the menu .
fish .
even better , he was raised with the highest <unk> of sustainability .
so you could feel good at selling .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , he called the chief of the company , and he asked if i would talk at an event about sustainability <unk> .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve this problem for our chefs that had been called <unk> , like we kept fish in our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we were fishing in the seas in the same way that we were cutting our forests .
it &apos;s hard to get rid of destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the salmon , all collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for good or for bad , <unk> , fish <unk> , will be part of our future .
there &apos;s a lot of rules against it . fish <unk> , at least most of them do , and they &apos;re inefficient , taking the example of tuna . a major disadvantage .
it has a 15 @-@ to @-@ one food rate .
this means that you need 15 pounds of wild fish to generate a kilo of <unk> .
it &apos;s not very sustainable .
it &apos;s not very tasty either .
so here , finally , there was a company trying to do the right thing .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the pr superintendent .
<unk> don .
&quot; gift , &quot; i said , &quot; only to make the facts clear , you are famous for raising so far sea inside , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
he said , &quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far , that the waste of our fish is distributed , it &apos;s not concentrate . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world in itself .
that food intensity ? 2.5 to one , &quot; said .
&quot; the best in the <unk> . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what are they feeding them ? &quot;
<unk> protein , he said to me .
&quot; great , &quot; i said , &quot; and i <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , right before the event , i called it don <unk> .
i said , &quot; sir , what are some examples of sustainable protein ? &quot;
he said i didn &apos;t know . i &apos;d say up there .
well , i spoke on the phone with some people in the company . no one could give me a direct answer , until i finally spoke on the phone with the <unk> in charge .
call it don don don don .
&quot; gift , &quot; i said , &quot; what are these examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish food , and then he said chicken <unk> .
i said , &quot; chicken wings ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone , remains , <unk> and processed in food . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of the food is chicken ? &quot;
think about two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , have it sustainable to feed the fish ? &quot;
there was a long silence online , and he said , &quot; that &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i &apos;m glad to get rid of this <unk> .
no , not because it &apos;s some gourmet <unk> <unk> .
i really am .
no , i really struggled with this fish , because , i swear to god , that after that conversation , fish had a taste of chicken .
the second fish , is another kind of love story .
the romantic guy , the guy you know the fish , the more you love fish .
i ate it for the first time in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine was talking about this fish for a long time .
somehow she organized our first date .
he came to the table of a white , of course , and almost <unk> .
the chef had gone on fire .
type twice .
incredibly , just like that was delicious .
can you make a fish the same as rich after being so <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
call him michelangelo . his name is <unk> , actually .
and no , he doesn &apos;t value fish , and it &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way we understand it and i .
it &apos;s a biologist running the palm .
it &apos;s a fish <unk> on the <unk> @-@ west edge of spain .
it &apos;s at the end of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , the <unk> was in the hands of <unk> .
it also <unk> cows in what they were essentially <unk> .
they managed to <unk> the ground .
they built this <unk> series of canals , and crossed the water into the ground into the river .
well , they didn &apos;t make it work , not in any economic way .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed something like 90 percent of the birds , which for a place like this , are many birds .
and then in 1982 , a spanish company with an environmental awareness purchased the land .
what did they do ?
they invested the flows of water .
it literally <unk> the switch .
instead of pushing water out , used the canals to attract the water into .
we channel channels .
they created a <unk> of pack @-@ acre fish -- <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and in the process , michelangelo and his company completely <unk> the ecological destruction .
<unk> is amazing .
i mean , they never saw something like this .
you look at the horizon that &apos;s about a million miles away , and you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s flooded , and this <unk> , rich <unk> .
i was there a lot of time with michelangelo .
it &apos;s an amazing guy , three parts of charles darwin and a <unk> <unk> .
ok ? so , there we are <unk> in the swamp , and i &apos;m <unk> and <unk> with mud at the height of my knees , and michelangelo is doing this with a biology conference .
here &apos;s a black <unk> <unk> .
now , it &apos;s called the minerals of <unk> .
and here , here he is looking at a pattern of clustering that makes him remember the <unk> of tanzania .
turns out , michelangelo spent most of his career in <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became an expert in fish .
he said , &quot; <unk> ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m a relationship expert . &quot;
and then it starts talking again about strange birds and <unk> and strange plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community , out that kind of thing .
it &apos;s fantastic , but i was in love .
and my head was bathed in that piece of delicious fish .
so i <unk> it . i said , &quot; michelangelo , that makes your fish so beautiful ? &quot;
it showed me the algae .
&quot; i know , <unk> , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it &apos;s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
which is the food conversion index ? &quot;
well , it starts to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system , that fish are eating what they would eat in their natural <unk> .
the biomass of plants , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , is what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s fully self @-@ renewable .
there &apos;s no food .
have you heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
later that day , i was driving with michelangelo around a property , and i asked him , &quot; i said , &quot; to a place which seems so natural , &quot; different from any <unk> i &apos;ve been visited , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that time , it was as if a movie director asked to change the stage .
and by bending in the corner , we saw the most incredible landscape , thousands and thousands of <unk> , literally a rose carpet .
&quot; that &apos;s successful , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at his <unk> , rose .
they &apos;re doing a <unk> . &quot; <unk> &quot;
okay ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , you &apos;re not doing a <unk> with your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs in the birds .
well , last year , this property had 600,000 more than 250 different species .
it became the biggest today , and one of the most important <unk> of birds across europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; michelangelo , a population of thriving birds is not the last thing you &apos;d like to have in your fish <unk> ? &quot;
it moved your head , &quot; no . &quot;
he said , &quot; we are in a hurry , not intensive .
this is an ecological network .
shrimp are eaten by shrimp .
shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the more pink you have the belly , the better the system . &quot;
well , congratulations . a <unk> that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a <unk> that measures their success in the health of their predators .
a fish <unk> , but also a bird sanctuary .
oh , and by the way , those <unk> , first of all , shouldn &apos;t be there .
<unk> in a village that remains 1,500 miles in which the ground conditions are better at making nests .
every morning , they fly 150 miles up to <unk> .
and every afternoon , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they can follow the white line on the highway <unk> .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i was imagining a thing about penguins , so i looked at michelangelo .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , fly 150 miles to the <unk> , and then they fly 150 miles back to night ?
do you understand that for your pups ? &quot;
he looked at me as though there was a cartoon about houston whitney .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t even like the fish skin . i don &apos;t like to eat it . i don &apos;t like to bathe .
that &apos;s <unk> taste , like tar .
i almost never use it to cook .
however , when i tried it in that restaurant in southern spain , it didn &apos;t have any taste of fish skin .
he had a sweet , clean taste , as if you were eating a <unk> of the ocean .
i mentioned that to michelangelo and <unk> with his head .
he said , &quot; <unk> skin like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something between the body .
it evolved to absorb <unk> . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
ok . a fish that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a <unk> that measures their success for the success of their predators .
and then i realized when he says , a <unk> that has no <unk> , made a huge understatement , because the water that flows through that freezing river comes from the <unk> river .
it &apos;s a river that <unk> all the things that rivers tend to drag today , chemical pollutants , pesticide <unk> .
and when you &apos;re entering the system and you go , the water is cleaner than when you entered .
the system is so healthy that it <unk> the water .
so , not only a <unk> that does not feed your animals , not just a <unk> that measures your success for your predators , but a <unk> that is literally a water <unk> plant , and not only for those fish , but for you and for me as well .
because when the water goes down , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should also take it , because this love story , although romantic , is also education .
you might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of food , which we &apos;re talking about <unk> or beef .
what we need now is a radically different conception of agriculture , in which food actually is tasty .
but for a lot of people , that &apos;s too radical .
we &apos;re not realistic with us ; we &apos;re lovers .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love small family farms . we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
and when it suggests that these are the things that the future of good food , someone else will say , &quot; hey , <unk> , i love pink <unk> , but you will feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing calories anymore to feed the world .
one billion people will be hungry today .
one billion is more than ever before in history -- because of big inequities in the distribution , not <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it has determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feeding grain to the herbivores , crop pesticides , chemicals on the ground , chicken to the fish , and all the way around , the <unk> has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people in a cheaper way , how terrible it can be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motivation . it &apos;s been the <unk> . it &apos;s been the business plan for american agriculture .
we should call it what really is , a business in <unk> , a business that is rapidly <unk> the ecological capital that makes its own production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and that &apos;s not agriculture .
our card basket is now being threatened today , not by a decrease of supplies , but by a decrease in resources .
not for the last invention of tractors , but for the fertile soil , not for bombs , but for fresh water , not for <unk> , but by forests , and not by ships and fishing nets , but by the fish in the sea .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better . how can we create conditions that allow each community to serve itself ?
to do this , don &apos;t look at the model of the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old and exhausted .
it &apos;s <unk> in capital , chemistry , and machinery , and it &apos;s never really rich to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s the two billion years of real work experience .
look at michelangelo , farmers like michelangelo .
<unk> that are not a world that is locked away in itself , <unk> that will flow instead of farming , <unk> that foster in a purely critical way , farmers who are not only producers , but expertise in relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also the flavor experts .
and i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re better chef than i &apos;ll never be .
you know , i don &apos;t have a problem with that , because if that &apos;s the future of food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i can leave you this day with one big idea , is that the data cluster we consume is bigger than the sum of the parts , and instead of looking at it as an information overload , what i want you to think about is how we can use that information to see patterns and see trends in another way that are invisible .
so , what we &apos;re looking at here is a typical baseline of mortality organized by age .
this tool i use is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and with <unk> what i can do is filter a particular cause of deaths , say accidents .
and immediately we see a different pattern .
this is because , in the central section here , people are at the most active stage , and here they are in the most fragile .
we can go back and forth again and look at the data due to death , looking at the raw diseases and cancer are the usual suspects , although not for everybody .
if we do our age , say age 40 , we see that accidents are really the main cause of people to worry about .
and if you get more involved in that , it &apos;s more common in men &apos;s case .
so , they understand the idea that seeing information and data in this way , is how to swim through a living data set .
and if we can do this with data , raw , why don &apos;t we also do it for content ?
so what we have here , is the cover of all the titles that have been produced .
this is all over here . on the web .
they can go back to their rooms and try this after my talk .
<unk> can reduce it to a decade .
or you reduce it to a particular year .
or you can leap straight into a particular editing .
so i &apos;m looking at this , i see athletes that have appeared in this issue , sports .
i &apos;m a fan of lance , so i &apos;ll give him a click of that , which reveals me , all the <unk> in which he &apos;s lance <unk> .
now if you just want to take a look at this , you could think , &quot; what if you look at everything related to cycling ? &quot;
so i can go back , and i can scale that .
and now i see greg <unk> .
so you have an idea that when you measure information like this , by spreading , by expanding , by <unk> , you &apos;re not looking at , you &apos;re not browsing .
they &apos;re doing something slightly different .
it &apos;s in the middle , and we think it changes the way information takes itself .
so i want to transport this idea a little bit , which is a bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve taken all the pages of wikipedia and we &apos;ve reduced them to a little summary .
the summary is a little <unk> and an icon that suggests the area of <unk> that comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the 500 more popular pages of wikipedia .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we can have a sense of the most popular <unk> in wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to select government .
now , having selected government , i can see that the wikipedia categories most often corresponded to that are the time <unk> magazine <unk> .
this is truly important because this reveals something that was not content on any page of wikipedia .
you can only take that look when you step back and see it all .
seeing one of these particular summaries , i can then drill into the concept of time <unk> magazine , and look at all .
so seeing these people , i can see that most of them come from government . some come from natural sciences . a few , come from the world of businesses . there &apos;s my boss , and one of them comes from music .
and most interest , bono is also a winner of the ted prize .
so we can jump up and take a look at all the winners of the ted prize .
as you can see , we &apos;re browsing the web for the first time , as if it were actually a network , not from page , but on a higher level of abstraction .
i want to show you one more thing i can maybe <unk> a little bit .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times <unk> here .
and <unk> , this tool -- i don &apos;t want a web browser ; it &apos;s really not a web browser , but you can see pages with it -- and we bring the technology zoom into every page like this .
i can go back , i can give a <unk> back to a specific section .
now , the reason it &apos;s important is because , by the simple fact of seeing pages of this way , i can see my full shipping history in the same way .
and i can go into what i &apos;ve done in particular time periods .
here , in fact , the state of all the demonstration i just gave .
and i can make a reproduction of some of the things i saw tonight .
and if i want to go back and see everything , i can take over and i can cut my records maybe by the search history . here , i was doing a little bit of <unk> search , and i was looking for <unk> , which is here at live <unk> .
and from here i can go to the website and make it available .
it &apos;s a metaphor that has a new purpose every time , and in every case it makes the sum bigger than the sum of its parts with the data .
so now , in this world , we think of data as a curse .
we talked about the information overload curse .
we talk about <unk> in data .
what if we turn it back to this and we put our head on the web , so that instead of going from one thing to the next , we would give ourselves the habit of being able to go from so many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that would otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being stuck in data , we can actually draw information .
and if , instead of just dealing with information , we can gather knowledge .
and if we have knowledge , then maybe we can find wisdom .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up with a science @-@ based diet .
at school , they were running a bus for an hour &apos;s school every day .
and i was always involved in a book , an ad @-@ fiction book , which i witnessed to my mind to other worlds , and i was , in an instance , the insatiable sense that i had .
and you know , curiosity also manifests itself in the sense that i was always in school , i was in the forest , making <unk> and taking samples , snakes , snakes and snakes , and <unk> , watching them through the microscope .
you know , i was a real fan of science .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , to understand the boundaries of the possibility .
and my love for science fiction was reflected in the world around me , all around what was happening , at the end of the &apos; 60s , <unk> the moon , <unk> the deep oceans .
jacques cousteau came out in our room with his incredible special rooms where he taught us animals and places and a wonderful world that we could never have imagined before .
so that sounded like her part of science fiction .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i found that , as i had no video games , or this version of films made by computer and all this media landscape , i had to create images in my head .
we all do , as kids who have to read a book , through the description of the author , we put something on the film screens of our heads .
so , my answer to this was painting , drawing aliens and their worlds , spaceship , all that .
i was infinitely experimenting with the mathematics class behind the notebook .
that was the creativity that i had to come out somehow .
and something interesting happened , the show of jacques <unk> actually <unk> me about that there was a world that was only sitting here on earth .
i could probably not go to an alien world on a spaceship one day . that seemed quite unlikely .
but that was a world that i could actually go , right here on earth , which was so alive and as exotic as anything i could have ever read one of those books .
so , i decided that i was going to turn myself into 15 years .
even though the only problem about that was that i lived in a canadian <unk> , at 600 miles from the near ocean .
even though i didn &apos;t let that leave me alone .
i gave her the can to my father until he finally discovered a class of diving , new york , right across the border we lived .
so , i <unk> myself in a pool in a <unk> in the middle of the wintertime in buffalo , new york .
and i didn &apos;t see a ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the last 40 years , i &apos;ve been about 3,000 hours underwater , 500 of them in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that that that habitat of the deep ocean and even the least profound , are so rich in an incredible life that actually exceeds the imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so boundless compared to our weak human imagination .
even today , i &apos;m still completely unaware of what i &apos;ve seen when i do these <unk> .
and my romance with the ocean continues , and just as loud as it was always .
even though i chose a profession , as an adult , it was the conductor .
and it seemed to be the best way to reconcile those stories , with the willingness to create images .
and i was , as a child , constantly drawing comics and things like that .
so , making movies was a way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course , the stories i documented were stories of science fiction : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; and &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and with &quot; the <unk> , &quot; i put my love for being underwater and diving , with making films .
by combining the two passions .
one interesting thing happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; which served to solve a determined storytelling problem in the movie , which was to create a type of liquid water creature , so we took the animation done by the computer , rendering it .
and it turned out to be the first characters on the surface made by a computer that has never been made in a movie .
and even though the film wasn &apos;t very profitable , practically no profits , i should say i witnessed something incredible , which was the audience , the world audience , was devastated by this apparent magic .
it &apos;s like arthur <unk> &apos;s law that says any advanced technology can &apos;t be distinguish from magic .
they saw something magical .
so that made me pretty much .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be adapted in the <unk> art . &quot;
so , &quot; 2nd terminator , &quot; my next movie , we took this much more <unk> .
working with <unk> , we created the liquid metal uncle in that movie , the <unk> was in whether the effect would work .
and it worked . and we created magic again , and we had the same outcome of the audience , even though we took something out of money with this .
so , drawing a line through those two points of experience , we came to see that , this was going to be a new world , this was a whole new world of creativity .
so , you think of a company with stan winston , my good friend stan , who is the main <unk> and designer at <unk> of the day , and we call it digital <unk> .
and the goal of the company was that you would have a leap on top of the optical <unk> processes , etc . , and you would direct directly to digital production .
and in fact , we did it and we got a competitive advantage for a while .
even though we were left behind in the mid @-@ 1990s in creating and designing characters , for what the company had been founded .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; , &quot; which was laid out absolutely to drive the development of visual effects , made by computer , but beyond that , with human characters created by a computer , and the main characters would be all mediated by the computer . and the world would be done by computer .
but the challenge was , and the company told me we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so i rented it , and i made this movie about a big boat that <unk> .
you know , i went and sold it to the studio like &quot; romeo and juliet : it &apos;s going to be a <unk> romance , an incredibly exciting film .
in tears , what i wanted to do was to immerse myself in the true <unk> of the titanic .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the study did not know .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go into the <unk> sands . let &apos;s record it real . &quot;
we &apos;ll use it at the beginning of the movie .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing force . &quot;
and i talked to them to fund an expedition .
it sounds crazy . but it goes backwards to what its imagination is to create a reality .
because in fact , we created a reality where six months later , i found myself in a russian submersible two miles and a half miles underwater , looking at the actual titanic through a window .
not in a movie , not in <unk> , really .
now , that made me fly to my mind .
and that took a lot of training , we had to build cameras and lights and all that kind of thing .
although , that made me realize how much of this dive , these profound <unk> seemed to be a spatial mission .
you know , it was pretty technical , and it had a huge planning .
you get into the capsule , you go down below that dark and you get an environment where there &apos;s no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t go back to you .
and i thought of something like , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like i was living a science fiction movie .
this is great . &quot;
so , i was really fascinated by the exploration of the deep ocean .
of course , curiosity , the scientific component of it . it was all . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood could not give me .
because , i could imagine a creature and we could create a special effect for her , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing through that window .
as we did in some of our <unk> expeditions , i was seeing <unk> across the <unk> of the water and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen sometimes <unk> things that nobody had ever seen before , that actually wasn &apos;t described by science at the same time that we saw it and <unk> it .
so , i was completely disillusioned by this , and i had to do more .
so , i made a curious decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to set up my work as a director of hollywood , and i &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time <unk> . &quot;
so , we started planning these expeditions .
and we ended up going to the <unk> , and we <unk> with <unk> vehicles .
we went back to the remains of the titanic .
we took a few little robots that we had created with an optical fiber .
and the idea was to go in and make an inner recognition of the ship , which had not been done before .
no one had ever seen the remains of <unk> inside ; they &apos;d never had the media to do it , so we created a technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am , on the deck of the titanic , sitting in a submersible and looking at the planks that looked much like these , where i knew the gang had played .
and i would drive a little robotic vehicle across the aisle of the ship .
when i say , i drive , but my mind is in the vehicle .
as though it was physically present inside the titanic remains .
and it was the most surreal <unk> i &apos;ve ever had , because before we saw a corner , i knew what was going to be before the lights on the vehicle were dominated , because i had been dragging around the logs for months when we were making the film .
and the <unk> was based on an accurate replica of the airplane of the ship .
so it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
and it really made me realize the experience of television that you can have with these robots , through which your consciousness is embedded in a vehicle , in some form of existence .
it was really deep .
and it can be almost as a glimpse of what can be happening in a few decades when we start having bodies <unk> to explore , or somewhere in many of the future <unk> that i can imagine , like a fan of science fiction .
so , having done these expeditions , i really started to appreciate what was underneath , in the deep ocean <unk> where we had <unk> animals that are basically aliens here on earth .
they live in a <unk> habitat .
they don &apos;t survive a sun @-@ based system like us .
so , you &apos;re seeing animals that live about 500 degrees centigrade .
they may not even exist .
at the same time , i started to be very interested in spatial science as well , again , the influence of science fiction , as a child .
and i ended up with the space community , which is very involved with nasa , with a post in nasa &apos;s advice , planning real space missions , going to russia , checking the <unk> protocols for pre @-@ <unk> , and all that kind of thing , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d system .
and it was fascinating .
even though what i ended up doing was bringing scientists to space with us to the deep .
and they had access to them , they did biologists , planetary scientists , interested in these extreme habitats , <unk> the ventilation , <unk> to see , and take samples and test instruments , and all that .
so , there we were in documentaries , but actually we were doing science , and especially spatial science .
i had completely closed the bow between being a fan of science fiction , you know , as a child , and doing all of this .
and you know , over the course of this journey of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . although i learned a lot about leadership .
you may think that a conductor has to be a leader , a captain of the ship , and all that .
i hadn &apos;t really learned about leadership until i did those expeditions .
because i had to , at a certain point , i say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why am i doing it ? what am i wearing from it ? &quot;
we won &apos;t make money with these <unk> programs .
there &apos;s hardly any <unk> in it .
people think that i &apos;d lie somewhere between &quot; titanic &quot; and avatar &quot; and i was <unk> the nails , somewhere , sitting on the beach .
i did all those movies , all those documentaries for a very reduced audience .
no fame , no fame , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it because of the task itself , by the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment , which is , by the excitement of discovery , and by that weird <unk> that when a small group of people form a very tight team .
because we would do these things with 10 @-@ 12 people working for years at a time , sometimes in the sea for two months at a time .
and with that <unk> , you realize that the most important thing is the respect you have and you have , when you do something you can &apos;t explain to each other .
when you go back to shore and you say , &quot; we have to do this , &quot; and the fiber , and the optical <unk> , and this and the other , all the technology of that , and the difficulty , the aspects of the human performance when you &apos;re working on the sea , you can &apos;t explain it to people . that &apos;s what they have done , or they have .
you create a <unk> , a <unk> of respect .
so , when i went back to make my next movie , which was in avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same principle of leadership in which i sent your team , and so you would win your respect .
and that really changed the dynamic .
and there i was with a little team in unexplored terrain in avatar , &quot; building new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremendously exciting .
terribly challenging .
and we became a family , during a four @-@ year period .
and that completely changed the way i make films .
people have <unk> on how they have changed , you know , we brought back to the organisms in the ocean and put them on pandora &apos;s planet .
for me , it was more a fundamental way to do the work , the process itself , which changed as a result of that .
so what can we summarize about all this ?
what are the lessons ?
well , i think the first one is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing they have .
imagination is a force that can manifest a reality .
and the respect of his team is more important than all the world &apos;s <unk> .
young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some advice to do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put you on limits .
other people will do it for you , don &apos;t do it for you , don &apos;t harm you and take risks . &quot;
nasa has a phrase they love : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has gone from being an option in art and exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
and no major effort that has required innovation has been done without running any risk .
they have to be willing to run risks .
and that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d leave you with , whatever you do , fail is a choice , but fear doesn &apos;t . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a little bit surprising because my full @-@ time work in the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , about things that we need to invent and to improve the lives of 2000 million poorest .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than any other on the planet .
climate change means that for many years their crops will not grow , there will be too much rain , or not enough rain , things will change so that their fragile environment can simply not sustain .
and that leads to hunger . it leads to <unk> .
climate change will be terrible for them .
also the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could choose one single thing that you would perceive the price to reduce poverty , without doubt the energy .
the price of energy has fallen through time .
indeed , the advanced civilization is based on energy advances .
the coal @-@ powered industrial revolution , and even in the years 1900 , we saw a rapid decrease in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have <unk> , air , we can make lots of modern materials and do so many things .
and then , we &apos;re in a fantastic situation with electricity in the developed world .
but as we make it more economical -- and let &apos;s try to make it twice more economic -- we must deliver a new constraint , and that restriction has to do with co2 .
co2 is heating the planet , and the equation of co2 is actually very simple .
if you add the co2 that &apos;s being emitted , that gives rise to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase occurs instead to some very negative effects , the effects about climate and maybe even worse , the <unk> effects , because the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and then the ecosystems collapse .
the exact <unk> of how to map from a certain co2 increase to temperature we will have and the exact behavior of variables , there &apos;s some uncertainty there , but not too much .
and there are surely uncertainty about what those effects will be , but they &apos;ll be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the most scientists about this a number of times , do we have to go down to almost zero emissions ?
can we just cut a half or a quarter ?
and the answer is , until we can &apos;t close to zero , temperature will continue to increase .
and so that &apos;s a great challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we &apos;re a four @-@ foot tall truck trying to get under a 10 @-@ foot @-@ a @-@ half @-@ foot bridge , and we can somehow just utter a little bit to pass a little bit through it .
this is something that has to come to zero .
we make a lot of carbon dioxide every year , more than <unk> million tons .
about 20 metric tons per ton per square ton per one in the poor countries .
it gives you an average of about five metric tons per person on the planet .
and in a way , we must make changes to take that figure at zero .
it &apos;s been constantly completed .
it &apos;s only because of some economic change that has come to grips with , so we have to go from fast to <unk> , and we &apos;re going all the way down to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . so you have one thing on the left , co2 you want you to get to zero , and it will be based on how many people , the services each person uses on average , the energy on the average for every service , and the co2 per unit of energy .
so let &apos;s look at each and see how we can go down to zero .
probably some of these numbers will have to get close to zero .
now to go back to high school algebra , but let &apos;s get a bonus .
first , we have the population .
the world has currently <unk> million people .
and it &apos;s on the way to reach <unk> million .
now , if we do a big job in new vaccines , health care , and reproductive health services , we might be able to reduce that figure , maybe 10 or 15 percent , but there &apos;s a <unk> increase in the order of 1.3 to 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes everything , the food we eat , the sidewalk , the heat .
these are very good things , and eliminating poverty means giving these services to almost all over the world on the planet .
and it &apos;s a big thing that this number goes up .
in the rich world , maybe one billion <unk> , we could reduce and use less , but every year , this figure , on average , goes up and then , in general terms , goes more than double the services per person .
here &apos;s a very basic service . do you have light in your house so you can read the task ?
in fact , these kids are out there and they read their task under the light of street lamps .
now , efficiency @-@ e , is energy for every service , here , finally , we have good news .
we have something that &apos;s not increasing .
through various inventions and new ways of making lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building <unk> , there are many services in which you can reduce energy consumption .
some individual services do it in 90 percent .
there are other services , such as the way to make the fertilizers , or the transportation of entomology , in which the <unk> are much smaller .
and then , in general here , if we &apos;re optimistic , we can maybe get to a factor of three , to maybe a factor of six .
but for these first three factors we went from <unk> million to maybe 8,000 million tons in the best cases , and that doesn &apos;t get the goal .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this one is going to be the key factor -- and this is the amount of co2 produced by every unit of energy .
and the question is , can you actually make it to zero ?
if we coal , no .
if you ate natural gas , no .
almost every method we create electricity today , except for the new renewables and nuclear , puts co2 .
and so what we &apos;re going to have to do on a global scale , is create a new system .
and then , we need miracles of energy .
when i use the word miracle , i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and services are a miracle .
the people who are here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
usually , we don &apos;t have a limitation , where you have to have the miracle ready for a certain date .
usually , in a certain way , and some people come , and another one .
this is a case where we really need to move forward at maximum speed and make a miracle in a very clenched time .
i thought , how can i really capture this concept ?
is there any type of natural illustration ? have you any show that people &apos;s imagination will be ?
i thought , in the past year when i brought in mosquitos , and in a sense , people will perceive it .
i actually got into the idea that , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
so , with the energy , the only thing that i came up with was this .
i decided that shutting down fireflies would be my contribution towards the environment here , this year .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i &apos;ve told me that i &apos;m not <unk> , in fact , maybe not out of this jar .
now , there are all sorts of <unk> solutions like that , but in the end , and they don &apos;t get too much .
we need solutions , it can be one or several , that have an unimaginable scale and an unimaginable variability , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for , i just see that five changes can achieve .
i left the near @-@ power , geothermal energy , fusion and bio @-@ fuels .
those can come into a contribution , and if you can get more than i hope , much better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t fit them into any of them because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels that are burning , both burning or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there looks simple , but it &apos;s not , and this is to take all the co2 after the combustion from its head to high pressure , create a liquid , stick it somewhere , and expect it to stay there .
we have a pilot trials that achieve this with a success between 60 and 80 percent , but reaching 100 percent , that will be very difficult , and agree on where to store these tons of co2 will be difficult , but the most difficult thing here is the long term .
is it going to be safe ?
are you going to guarantee something that &apos;s literally one billion times bigger than any other kind of <unk> compared to nuclear or other ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is complicated .
next , it would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems . the cost is high , particularly in highly <unk> countries , the subject of security , feel really good that nothing can fail , that even having human operators , the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the rubbish ?
and even though it &apos;s not very large , there are many concerns about it .
people need to feel <unk> about it .
so they &apos;re three very difficult problems that could be solved , and you should work on them .
we will last three of the five .
these are the ones that many times people refer to as renewable sources .
and actually -- although it &apos;s very good that they don &apos;t require any fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is that energy density in these technologies is dramatically less than an energy plant .
these are energy farms , so we &apos;re talking about lots of square miles , thousands of times bigger than traditional energy plants .
in addition , these are <unk> sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , doesn &apos;t shine every day , and in the same way , the <unk> doesn &apos;t penetrate all the time .
and then , if we depend on these sources , we have to have some way to get the energy during those periods where it &apos;s not available .
so here we have big cost challenges . we have delivery challenges . for example , if this energy is out of our country , we don &apos;t just need the technology , but we have to deal with the risk of energy from the other side .
and finally , this storage problem .
and , in order to expand , i study and look at all the kinds of batteries that are made , for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything , and i compared that to the amount of energy that the world uses , and what i discovered is that all the batteries that we make might now store less than 10 minutes of that energy .
so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough in this regard , an improvement by a factor of a hundred or more than the advances we have today .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very easy .
this is what happens when you try to get the <unk> source to be up for 20 or 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re telling this for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
how are we going to move forward with this ? what &apos;s the right way of <unk> ?
is it like the manhattan project ? what is it that &apos;s going to take us to its destination ?
well , we need a lot of companies working on this , <unk> .
in each of these five ways , we need at least a hundred people .
and many of them , <unk> and say they &apos;re nuts . that &apos;s good .
and i think here in the ted group , we have a lot of people who are already pursuing this goal .
bill <unk> has various companies , including one called <unk> that has several very good solar technologies .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is investing in dozens of companies that are doing big things , and they have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to distance them .
with nathan myhrvold -- we &apos;re criticizing a <unk> , which is , perhaps , amazingly , on the nuclear .
there are innovation in nuclear : modular , liquid .
and the innovation goes into this industry quite a while ago , so the concept that there are some good ideas running around is not surprising .
the idea behind <unk> is that instead of burning part of the uranium , one percent , we decided , we will double the 99 percent , the <unk> .
it &apos;s a crazy idea .
in fact , people have talked about this for a long time , but they could never properly simulate whether it would work or not , and it &apos;s through the arrival of the modern supercomputers that you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material , it seems that it could work .
and because you &apos;re burning 99 percent , you have a profile of highly improved costs .
you &apos;re actually burning the waste , and you can use it as fuel all the waste you &apos;re coming from today &apos;s reactors .
so instead of worrying about them , you use them . it &apos;s a big thing .
it &apos;s consuming this uranium as we go through it . it &apos;s like a candle .
as you can see there , it &apos;s a stem , it will often be like a spread generator .
on the fuel level , this actually solves the problem .
i have a picture here from a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent , of which already took the part that &apos;s burning today , so it &apos;s called uranium <unk> .
that made sure of electricity in the united states for hundreds of years .
and , simply by putting seawater through a low @-@ cost process , you would have enough fuel for the entire rest of the planet .
so , you know , it has many challenges ahead , but it &apos;s an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to go ahead .
so , let &apos;s think , how should we define ourselves ?
what should our school address look like ?
well , let &apos;s look where we actually have to get there , and then let &apos;s look at the middle point .
by 2050 , you listened to a lot of people talking about this 80 percent reduction .
it &apos;s really important that we get to that point .
and that 20 percent will be used by needs in poor countries like agriculture , we will hopefully destroy <unk> and cement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to change its entire generation .
so the other note is , are we <unk> this zero @-@ emission technology ? are we <unk> it in all developed countries ? and are we in the process of bringing it back to other places ?
that &apos;s very important .
it &apos;s a key element to pass that school letter .
so , going back from there , how should you see the cartoon of the year 2020 ?
well , again , i should have two elements .
we should establish these efficiency measurements to begin to make a difference . the less the co2 , the less co2 , and therefore the less it will be the temperature .
but in some ways , the note that we get there , doing things that don &apos;t take us all the way to the big <unk> , is just the same , or maybe even a little less important than the other , which is the piece of innovation of these big breakthroughs .
these advances , we need to move at maximum speed , and we can measure that at the level of companies , pilot projects , and require that they have changed .
there are many good books that have been written about this .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; our <unk> &quot; and the book of david <unk> , &quot; sustainable <unk> , without hot air . &quot;
they actually study it and they create a framework for this to be widely discuss , because we need broad support for this .
there &apos;s a lot to <unk> .
so this is a desire .
it &apos;s a very concrete desire that will counteract this technology .
if i had only one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose who is president , i could choose a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could choose this thing that has half the cost and zero co2 emissions is invented this desire that i predicted .
this is the one that has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t have this desire , the split between people who think in the short term and in the long term will be terrible , between the united states and china , between the poor and rich countries , and most of the lives of those two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what am i focusing on you for you to step forward and drive ?
we need to look more funding for research .
when countries get together in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just discuss co2 .
you should discuss on this innovation agenda , and you would be shocked by these levels of ridiculously low overhead by these innovative approaches .
we need the market incentives , co2 tax incentives , carbon bonds , something that will counteract that price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need this <unk> to be more rational , than a <unk> , including the steps facing the government .
this is an important desire , but it &apos;s a desire that i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand more about <unk> , right -- i mean , first of all : can you give us a sense that scale of what would be the scale of investment ?
bill gates : to make the software out of super @-@ computer , to employ all of the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and we even test our materials on a russian reactor to make sure our materials work correctly , there alone would be in the hundreds of millions .
the hard thing is to build the pilot , get the various billions , find the regulator , the location in which one would be building the first of these .
once you have the first built , and if it works like intended , then , it &apos;s clear as day , because economic variables and energy density are so different from nuclear as we know it .
to understand well , it involves building deep on the ground almost like a bottom @-@ up nuclear fuel column , of this type of uranium already used , and then the process starts from above and then goes down ?
tt : it &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always producing gas from the reactor , so you have a lot of people and a lot of controls that can have a bug that you have to open and move things in and out . that &apos;s not good .
so if you have a very cheap fuel from which you can already carry for about 60 years -- just think of yourself as a stem -- <unk> and not have those same complications .
and it &apos;s only sitting there and burned for the 1960s , and then it &apos;s there .
it &apos;s a nuclear plant that includes its own solution of waste disposal .
tt : yeah . well , what happens to the waste , you can leave it there -- there &apos;s much less waste with this approach -- then you can actually grab that one , and put it into another and burn it .
and we started taking the waste that exists today , which is in these cooling <unk> or <unk> <unk> , which is our fuel to break .
so what was a problem for those reactors is what we feed our own , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of waste in a way that &apos;s pretty much due to going back into the process .
but when you talk to different people around the world , about these possibilities .
where is there more interest to actually do something with this ?
dw : well , we haven &apos;t chosen a place in particular , and there are all these rules of spread about anything called nuclear , so we &apos;re very interested in the business people have been in russia , india and china . i was here with the secretary , talking about how this would fit into the energy agenda .
so i &apos;m optimistic . french and japanese have done some work .
this is a variation on something that has previously been made .
it &apos;s an important breakthrough , but it &apos;s like a quick reactor , and many countries have built it , so anybody who has done a quick reactor is a candidate to be where the first one is .
so , in your head , scale of time and probability of putting something online ?
dw : well , we need first one of these things on top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ scale that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to implement .
that &apos;s more or less the time we should be in the environment .
and , you know , let &apos;s face it , if things are working well , which is desire so much , it could easily be .
and there are now , fortunately , dozens of companies , but we need them to be hundreds , that at once , if their science works well , if the funding for their plants works well , that they can compete for it .
and it &apos;s better if several of them are successful , because you could use a blend .
we need one to be successful .
in terms of large @-@ scale changes , this is the biggest thing you know that exists ?
<unk> : a revolutionary progress in energy is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without environmental diet , but environmental diet does so much more important .
in the world of nuclear , there are other innovators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their jobs as well as we know this , but modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a fluid reactor that looks a little bit difficult , but maybe you &apos;ll say the same thing about us .
and then , there are many different , but the beauty in this is that the uranium atom has millions of times more energy than , for example , a carbon atom and then , if you can deal with the negative dots , which are essentially the radiation , the footprint and the cost , in terms of effect on the land and various things , it &apos;s almost entirely in a category .
what if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we begin to take action measure that we should try to keep the temperature stable ?
dw : if you go into that situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten from more , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack . what do you do ? you possibly need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on something called geo @-@ engineering , which are various techniques that will reduce warming to give us a maybe 20 or 30 years from now , until we agree .
now , that &apos;s just a insurance <unk> .
you don &apos;t expect to do that .
some people say that you shouldn &apos;t work on the insurance <unk> because you can make yourself safe and <unk> by eating because you know that your heart surgery will save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the option given to the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the discussion about geo @-@ engineering , if we should have it on our sleeve , in case things were going faster , or that innovation is much slower than what we expected .
climate <unk> : if you had a sentence or two to tell you , like the <unk> that are wrong ?
tt : well unfortunately , the skeptics come from different sides .
scientists who make scientific arguments are very few .
are you saying that there are negative feedback effects that you have to do with clouds that offset things ?
there &apos;s very , very few things you can even say there &apos;s a possibility in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here is something like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay the price much later .
and then , when you have all sorts of other urgent problems , the idea of suffering now that has to do with a profit later -- and an uncertain suffering -- in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst stage , and there are people in the developed world who look at the ipcc and say , well , this is not that big deal .
the fact is that it &apos;s that uncertain part that i should go into this .
but my dream here is that if you can do it in an economic way , and with the co2 constraints , then i &apos;m going to say , well , i don &apos;t care that i &apos;m not going to co2 , i would like you to co2 , but i think i accept it because it &apos;s cheaper .
and then , that would be your response to the <unk> argument , which basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take your attention away from your other objectives of trying to release the world of poverty , and malaria , and etc . that investment in that is a waste of the resources that we can do .
dw : well , real spending on the part of i &apos;m r &amp; amp ; d -- says the united states should spend 10,000 million more than what they &apos;re currently doing -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
i shouldn &apos;t take it to other things .
the moment you go into big numbers , and in this reasonable people can disagree , it &apos;s when you have something that &apos;s not economical and you &apos;re trying to kill them . that &apos;s , largely , a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re funding the learning curve , and you &apos;re going to get really cheap . i think we should try more things that have a potential to be much less costly .
if the exchange you enter is , let &apos;s make the super @-@ expensive energy , then rich can buy it .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times more for our energy and not change our lifestyles .
the disaster is for those two billion .
and even <unk> has even changed .
his <unk> now is , because isn &apos;t he discussing the r &amp; amp ; d ?
it &apos;s still , because of its earlier arguments , associated with the kind of <unk> , but it &apos;s realized that it &apos;s on a pretty solitary side , and then it &apos;s <unk> the argument of the i &apos;m r &amp; amp ; d.
and then there &apos;s a string of something that i think is appropriate .
the part of i &amp; amp ; d , it &apos;s incredible how little it &apos;s being funded .
well bill , i suspect i speak at the name of most people here saying , i really hope your desire becomes reality . thank you very much .
tt : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> introduced the <unk> of design called the <unk> .
and the idea is pretty simple . four people have to build an autonomous structure with 20 <unk> , a string <unk> , a string <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must go up above all .
and even though it looks easy , it &apos;s a rather difficult thing , because it force people to collaborate very fast .
and so i thought it was an interesting idea , and i hung it into a design shop .
and it was a great success .
and since then , i &apos;ve taken about 70 design workshops around the world with students , designers and architects , all the <unk> of major companies , and there &apos;s one particular exercise that reveals deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
most people start <unk> with the task .
the members and they discuss and calculate how the structure will be , will by the power .
then you have time planning , put on . you draw spaghetti .
they spend most of their time riding the <unk> .
and then finally , right when you just take the marshmallow , and with precaution , you put it on top , and then you look away , and &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
but in fact , what &apos;s often happening is that the &quot; da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ <unk> &quot; makes the weight of the caribbean makes the entire structure collapse .
so there are a number of people who have more &quot; oh no &quot; than others , and among the worst , are the graduates at business school .
lie , they cheat , they <unk> , and they produce <unk> structures .
and , of course , there are teams that have so many more structures , &quot; da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da structures .
and this is pretty incredible .
peter tells us , they &apos;re not only getting the tallest structures , but they &apos;re also the most interesting structures of all .
so , what you would say is , how ? why ? what is it that they have ?
peter likes to say , &quot; none of the kids attempt to be the ceo of spaghetti sauces . right .
they don &apos;t spend any time fighting .
but there &apos;s also another reason .
and that is that business students are trained to find the only right , right .
and then they don &apos;t do it .
and what happens is , when you put the marshmallow on them , they have no time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
can you feel something ? ok .
what kids do differently , is they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , they always keep the marshmallow on top , so they have a lot of opportunities for failed prototypes in the process .
designers consider this kind of collaboration as the essence of the <unk> process .
and with every version , kids get a snapshot observations about what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the ability to play with prototypes is essential , but let &apos;s look at different teams .
the average for most people is about half feet , business students , they get half of that , lawyers , a little bit better , but not much , kids , better than most adults .
who gets better than anybody ?
architects and engineers , thank god !
the highest structure i &apos;ve seen is one meter .
why would it be ? because they understand that the triangles and the patterns self @-@ sustain are the key to building stable structures .
the ceos , a little better than the average , but this is where they get interesting .
if you put a management executive in the team , ceos get better .
it &apos;s amazing . let &apos;s take a look and say , &quot; oh , that team is going to win . &quot;
you can see you in advance . and why ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they take the process , they understand it .
and any team that manages and <unk> in the work will significantly enhance the performance of his team .
specialized skills and <unk> , and the combination leads you to success .
if you have 10 teams who are often working together , we will work with about six stable structures .
and i took something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s make the bet .
i decided to offer 10,000 dollars in software to the winning team .
and what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . none of the teams had a stable structure .
if somebody had built , let &apos;s say , a one @-@ inch structure , they could have taken the prize for a house .
isn &apos;t it interesting that high risk has a strong impact ?
we did the same test with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
under these conditions , they understood the value of the prototypes .
and the same team step from being the worst to be amongst the best .
they get the tallest structures in the short time .
there are important lessons here about the phenomenon of incentives and success .
you would say , &quot; why would someone spend time designing a <unk> challenge ? &quot;
and the reason is that i will help create digital tools and processes to help teams build video games , video games and visual effects .
and what the challenge of the marshmallow is to help you with the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , all projects have their marshmallow , right ?
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common posture of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of the experience , of this simple exercise .
and those of you , you might want to visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how you build a <unk> .
there are instructions on this .
there are insane examples coming from around the world of how people change and retain the system .
there are world records as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i think , is that design is a contact sport .
we have all our senses sitting on the task , and we apply to our best ideas , our feelings and acts on the <unk> that we occupy .
and sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is all we need to take us from a &quot; oh @-@ no @-@ &quot; moment &quot; by a &quot; da <unk> . &quot;
and that can create a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s realize we have a machine right here .
a big machine , a super @-@ style machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and that each one in this room has to get into it .
and you can go back , you can go forwards ; you can &apos;t stay where you are .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i was making my friends this rather recently , and all of them want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . you want to go back before i &apos;d cook or twitter , or &quot; american idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some kind of cruel to <unk> , to the magical thought .
and i get that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because the possibilities on this planet , they &apos;re not going back , they &apos;re going forward .
so i want to get into the machine and i want to go forwards .
this is the best time i &apos;ve ever spent on this planet under any criteria you want to use : health , mobility , opportunity , disease rates going down .
there has never been a time like this .
my <unk> died , all of them for when they arrived at 60 .
my grandparents attribute that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in 80 .
so it &apos;s better than a nine in the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us because this is much bigger than that .
a child born in delhi today can waiting to live as much as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about that . it &apos;s an amazing fact .
and why is this true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed millions of people on this planet .
they explored the demographics in a way that no war has done it .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s gone .
the <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases that benefit millions of us only one generation back , almost .
blindness , <unk> , polio ...
somebody even knows that they &apos;re these things ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are victories by the scientific method .
and in my mind , the scientific method , testing things , see whether it works , change it when it doesn &apos;t work , is one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the only good news because there are other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is that , despite all our achievements , one billion people go to bed hungry in this world , every day .
that number is growing , and very fast , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to shatter this world .
clean water , <unk> soil , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re running out , and they &apos;re running out soon , and unless we invest in a solution to this disaster , we will regenerate ourselves .
so , the question is , we can do it ? i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that &apos;s going to thousands of people without <unk> the land we live on .
i think we can feed this world with energy that we can &apos;t feed it to time .
i really believe this , and no , it &apos;s not magical thinking .
but there &apos;s one thing that doesn &apos;t let me sleep -- one of the things that keeps me up . we &apos;ve never needed the progress of science more than now , never before .
and we &apos;ve never been in a position to think about it correctly , as we can today .
we &apos;re on the edge of astonishing events in many fields , and yet i certainly believe that we should go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we &apos;re going to spend progress , where we &apos;re going to spend more on these more <unk> , on more fronts , than what we do now .
people are wrapped in their beliefs , and they make it so easy that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will make them free .
and listen , everybody has the right to have their opinion ; they have the right to have their opinion about progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
you have no right to have your own facts . sorry , but you don &apos;t .
and notice this took me a while .
a decade ago , i wrote a vaccine for &quot; the new yorker , a short story .
and i &apos;m surprised to find opposition , as opposed to what it is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i did , i wrote an article and went ahead .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically modified foods .
it did the same , only worse .
people were saving .
so i took an article about it as well , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenstein , &quot; why we reasoned that to move the <unk> in a certain way , more than a neglected , it was invade the terrain of nature .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article and i went ahead .
i mean , i &apos;m just a journalist .
<unk> , let &apos;s go for dinner , it &apos;s okay .
but these stories , i was teased , and i could not understand why , and i finally became .
and that happened because the fanatics who were getting me crazy weren &apos;t really fans .
i was thinking people , decent , decent people .
they were exactly like people in this room .
and i was so worried about that .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress that we used to have .
we talked about him clapping .
we talk about it in relative terms , quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for it , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we have lost faith in the institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we haven &apos;t done it .
you can just say a few names and the people are saving .
<unk> , <unk> , the challenger , <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , <unk> electoral <unk> .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe that they were always right , so be skeptical .
ask , test , test evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get evidence , you have to accept evidence , and we &apos;re not good at doing that .
and the reason i can say this is because we &apos;re now in a scary epidemic i &apos;ve never seen before , and i hope i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a <unk> published , a terrible story , that prevented the autism epidemic to receive the vaccine against measles , <unk> and <unk> .
very frightening .
lots of studies were made to see if this was true .
lots of studies had to do , is a serious issue .
the results came .
the results came from the united states , england , from sweden , from canada , and everything was the same , no correlation , no connection , anything .
that doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe in what we see , in what we think we see , in what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a lot of documents from government giving us information , and i understand that , i think we all understand .
but you know what ?
the result of it has been disastrous .
disastrous by this fact : the united states is one of the few countries in the world in which vaccination rates are coming down .
this is unfortunate , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it &apos;s awful .
what kind of thing went on for us to do that .
now , i get it . i certainly get it .
because here , some of you have measles ?
have anybody in the audience ever seen anybody die from measles ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very much .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened sometimes in the past year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from measles . 20 an hour .
but because it hasn &apos;t happened here , we can take it out of our minds , and people like jenny can prescribe fear and carbonate from wherever oprah and larry <unk> .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t have causality and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these two things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same thing .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn very soon .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
the removed from us one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
without fear , without fear : polio , als , no more .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul <unk> .
he only developed a vaccine against <unk> with a group of people .
he saved the lives of 400,000 to 500,000 children per year in the world alone .
pretty good , no ?
well , it &apos;s okay , except because paul is out there talking about vaccines , and he says how valuable they are and that people should simply stop .
and actually , he says that .
so , paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks in a public audience , he can &apos;t be evicted without armed guards .
they get calls in their home because people like to tell him where their kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
and i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you get them , and diseases come back , awful diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and very soon kids are going to die of that again because it &apos;s just a game of numbers .
and they &apos;re not going to die only from measles .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a school partner told me about weeks ago , and he said i was a little stubborn .
never before had somebody said that .
she was not going to get her son to polio . anyway .
okay .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy took an airplane in lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to los angeles , right now he &apos;s on ohio .
and it &apos;s going to land within a couple of hours , it &apos;s going to rent a car , and it &apos;s going to come to long beach , and it &apos;s going to go and go into one of these fantastic dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a disfiguring disease , and we don &apos;t know , because it works the world .
this is the planet we live in . let &apos;s not do it as we don &apos;t .
now , we love <unk> in lies . we love doing it .
everybody took their vitamins tonight ?
let &apos;s face it , a little <unk> to stay young .
i know they did it because half the americans do it every day .
they take those things , and they take medicines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they don &apos;t serve anything .
data tells you all the time .
you urine your urine . you almost never do more than that .
okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for the dark .
i &apos;m totally with you .
urine . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand , we hate the big drug .
we hate the big governments . we don &apos;t trust the guy .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health system sucks .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolute and amazingly cold , and even for those we can pay for it .
so let &apos;s take care of him , and where we run ?
we jump into the arms of the great <unk> .
it &apos;s fantastic . i love the grand mufti .
but , you know , it &apos;s a really serious thing because these things are rubbish , and we spend billions of dollars on them .
and i have all kinds of little supplements here .
none of them -- <unk> , fraud , fraud , fraud , fraud , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on this , is a fraud .
and you know what ? when i say this , people scream at me , and they say , &quot; what do you mind ? let people do whatever you want .
he makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m not going to do any case of the evidence of my experts at <unk> or some sort of <unk> , who wants to treat his patient with coffee <unk> .
when you start the <unk> where you believe and magic replace evidence and science , in a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up <unk> , south africa .
he killed the <unk> of his people on top of himself by <unk> the lemon oil and bone oil were much more effective than anti @-@ retrovirals that we know can reduce the progress of aids .
hundreds of thousands of death toll in a country that has been fighting more than any of this disease .
please don &apos;t tell me that there &apos;s no consequences for these things .
there are . there are always .
now , the most insane epidemic in which we are , right now , is this insane battle between the ones who are proposing genetically modified and the organic elite .
it &apos;s a stylized debate . it has to end .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metaphor .
ideology , it &apos;s not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every <unk> of <unk> , every <unk> in brussels , has been modified by the man .
you know , i hadn &apos;t entered the garden of eden .
there was no <unk> .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some things worked and some things didn &apos;t .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more precisely . and there are hazards , absolutely . but we can put a little bit of vitamin a in rice , and that can help millions of people , millions of people , to prolong their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i should say , i don &apos;t understand .
we tended to genetically modified foods .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , hormones , crop , crop , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want <unk> companies .
we don &apos;t want seed companies .
and you know what my answer is to all that ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . they &apos;re clapping .
it &apos;s true , we have a very large food problem , but this is not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s the law , it &apos;s the moral , it &apos;s the patent issue .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea . it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t let science make its work because we &apos;re scared , it &apos;s really fatal , and it &apos;s avoiding millions of people can thrive .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to produce 70 percent more food than today , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
they need it , and we &apos;re not going to steal it .
and why ? genetically modified foods .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat those bad things , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that 500 million people eat .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a lot of calories . it sucks .
and it has no nutrients , it has no proteins , and scientists are bending all of this in it right now .
and then people could eat it and they could avoid being blind .
you wouldn &apos;t die of hunger , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be &quot; <unk> , &quot; but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is , why are we exhausted ?
i mean , hey , why are we exhausted ?
because we don &apos;t want to move from the genes ?
it &apos;s about moving genes from place . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> to have bigger , better food , unique food .
this is not about bulgarians , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s time that we start to understand what that means .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue acting as we are now , we are guilty of something i don &apos;t think we were guilty of being guilty , high @-@ tech <unk> .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beyond us , and we really have <unk> .
so , after this funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get into this ridiculous time machine and go forwards ? &quot;
absolutely . i want .
it &apos;s rooted in the present now , but we have an awesome opportunity .
we can program that time machine in what we want .
we can move where we want , and we &apos;re going to move where we want to move .
we must have these conversations , and we need to think , but when we get on the machine and go forward , we &apos;re going to be happy to do it .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the effect of <unk> , which may seem like a strange thing in what a magician might be interested in , not being in the way that i do it , which is , &quot; if somebody believes something fake enough , it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , only because one person thinks that what &apos;s going on is something that &apos;s pharmaceutical or something like a treatment of pain , for example , if you believe enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect on the body called the placebo effect .
a false thing becomes real because of the perception you have .
so we better understand , i want to start by showing you a simple magic trick and rudimentary .
and i will demonstrate you how it works . this is a trick that has been in the books of children since at least the 1950s .
i learned it from the <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll tell you because i explained it .
this is what happens .
the knife , which you can examine , examine my hand .
he <unk> the knife in my fist like this .
my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing goes up or come down , i &apos;ll hold my wrist up here .
so at any point , i can move around , at the time my wrist , where nothing can go up and down my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and i hope , if this whole <unk> , my animal magnetism <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s sustained so strongly that i can hide , and the knife does not fall .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , nothing you can look at everything .
<unk> @-@ da !
so this is the trick that i usually teach young people who are interested in <unk> , because they can learn quite a bit about comforting in this trick -- even when it &apos;s a simple trick .
probably many of you in this room know the trick .
what happens is this .
i &apos;m holding the knife with my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to hold my wrist , to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , it &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding my wrist is because that &apos;s really the secret of illusion .
at the moment that the front of my hand moves to be hidden from you , this finger , my finger will move where it is , to a position pointing like this .
very good .
somebody who didn &apos;t have childhood is there .
so , it &apos;s moving over here .
and as i move , my finger moves .
and we could talk about why it &apos;s a deception , why they didn &apos;t realize there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind , and how the information processes , doesn &apos;t count one , two , three . the <unk> .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about , right ? so i open my hand .
obviously this hanging there and not by animal magnetism , if not fraud , my finger is there .
and when i close my finger , just like that , when i move around , this movement sort of covers my finger &apos;s <unk> .
he retirement his hand . he <unk> the knife .
this is a trick that you can do for your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now . what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
i read a studio , about a year ago that really opened my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me was an amazing thing .
it turns out that if you use a dummy placebo in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s like the shape of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a long white pill , it has certain measurable effects .
but if you change the way you put the dummy placebo , like making a smaller pill , the blue <unk> , and you give it a letter , is notoriously effective .
even when none of the two have a pharmaceutical effect -- those are sugar pills .
but the white pill , it &apos;s not as good as the blue pill .
what ? that really resonated with me .
but it turns out that &apos;s not all .
if you have capsules , they &apos;re more effective than any other tablet .
a colored capsule , this is yellow on one side and red on the other , is <unk> that a white capsule .
<unk> has something to do with it .
a two @-@ fold pill a day , it &apos;s not as good as three <unk> -- i don &apos;t remember the statistics now . sorry .
but the point is ...
these <unk> have something to see .
and the shape also has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you go into the needles .
right ? a syringe has something <unk> a couple of <unk> of something that &apos;s an inert , and i &apos;ll look at the patient .
this is a very powerful picture in your mind , this is much stronger than any white pill .
it &apos;s actually , this graph , i &apos;ll show you at another time when there &apos;s the slides .
the point is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , and this isn &apos;t as good as the capsule and it &apos;s not as good as the needle .
and no one really has any pharmaceutical quality . it &apos;s just your belief that makes it real in your body and creates a strong effect .
i &apos;d like to see if you could actually take that idea , and apply it to a magic trick .
take something that &apos;s actually a fake trick and make it look real .
and we know from that study , that when you want something real , you get rid of the needles .
this is a seven @-@ inch hat hat hat , and i &apos;m going to play it a little bit .
this is my tissue . this is not . the special tissue of <unk> .
this is my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to penetrate my skin , and through the needle up to the other side .
if you were injured -- if you were easily criticized -- i was doing this for some friends at the hotel on the other night , and other people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman nearly drowned .
so i would suggest to you that if you &apos;re easily injured , look on the other side by the next -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;m going to do this first part of the next <unk> .
you &apos;ll see , you can look at the other side if you want .
so , this is what happens , the beginning of my tissue at the bottom of my arm , i made a little <unk> .
sorry , am i annoyed ?
and i warmed my skin a little bit , and i take it on the other side like this .
now , essentially we are in the same position as the knife trick .
somehow .
but right now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , or you can ?
so let me push you . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah , ok .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; well , he &apos;s not as silly to cut the skin just like <unk> for a few minutes . &quot;
so let me show you a little bit .
how are you going ? all right .
yeah .
and people back up there will say , &quot; okay , i can &apos;t see it . &quot;
the people in the living room are starting to move .
let me show you a little bit more .
this is really my skin . it &apos;s not a hollywood <unk> effect .
this is my flesh and i can move around .
sorry , if you &apos;re peering into something else , don &apos;t look at this .
people in the back or people who see the video will say , &quot; well , you see the effect , &quot; but if it were real , he would do this -- notice that there &apos;s a gap here and another there , if it were real , he would be absolutely upset .
well , let me show you a little bit of blood .
yeah , there it is .
usually , now i &apos;d be taking the needle .
i took my arm and showed them that there are no wounds .
but i think in this context , and with the idea of taking something false , and making it real , i &apos;ll leave it like this , and i &apos;ll get out of the stage .
i &apos;ll be watching you several times during the <unk> days .
i hope you will . thank you very much .
everybody speaks about happiness in these days .
i made somebody tell the number of books with the word &quot; happiness , &quot; in the title , published in the last five years and gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there &apos;s a huge outbreak of interest about happiness , among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of advice about happiness .
everybody in the world would like to make people happier .
but despite all this crowd of jobs , there are various shades of cognitive that make almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today will be especially about these matching cognitive traps .
this is both about the ordinary people who think about their own <unk> as the academics who are talking about happiness , because it turns out that we are as confused as others .
the first of these booby is <unk> in <unk> its complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is no longer a useful word because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s one particular meaning that we could neglect , but in general , this is something that we will have to <unk> , and we will have to adopt the toughest view of what the welfare is .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory : especially being happy in life and be happy with your life or your life as happy .
and these are two very different concepts , and both are <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the illusion of focus , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think of any <unk> that affects welfare without <unk> its importance .
i mean , this is a fundamental cognitive trap .
it &apos;s impossible not to fail .
now i &apos;d like to begin with an example of someone in a question and answers , after one of my conferences , who told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said i &apos;d been hearing a symphony and it was an absolutely wonderful music and at the end of the recording , there was a terrible sound .
and then he said , really quite affected , that he &apos;d lost his full experience .
but it wasn &apos;t .
what had gone missing was the memories of that experience .
i had had the experience .
i &apos;d had 20 minutes of a glorious music .
and they did not know at all because they stayed with a memory , the memory had gone wrong , and it was all they left .
what this tells us , actually , is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two <unk> .
there &apos;s a self that has experiences , which lives in the present and knows the present , is able to revive the past , but basically it has the present .
it &apos;s the self that has experiences that treat a physician when you ask , &quot; do you hurt now , when i play here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a self that remembers , and the self that reminds is that it takes note , and it holds the history of our life , and it &apos;s the doctor asking him , &quot; how do you feel lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; how did your trip to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different entities , the self that has experiences and the self that has memories and <unk> between them is part of how problematic happiness .
now , the self that has memories is a storyteller .
and that &apos;s really starting as an immediate response to our memories -- <unk> .
we don &apos;t just tell stories , when we tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get left to remember from our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
this is an old studio .
these are actual patients being treated by a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was , when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to lie on their pain every 60 seconds .
and here we have two patients . these are the data .
and if you ask , &quot; who suffered from them ? &quot;
it &apos;s a very easy question .
of course , the patient b suffered more . their <unk> went longer , and every minute of pain the patient a had the patient a b b and even more .
but now we ask another question : &quot; how many of these patients have suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s the surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a had a much worse memory of the <unk> than the patient b.
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is as a result .
and none of these stories inspire a lot , but one of them is different ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse was the one in which the pain had its peak at the end . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after the training , and much later , &quot; how painful was the experience , in general ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in the way you remember it .
so it &apos;s a direct conflict between me having experiences and the self that reminds .
from the point of view of the self that has experiences , it &apos;s clear that b had a worse experience .
now , what we could do with the patient a , and in fact we did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it really works , could spread the <unk> of the patient by just keeping the tube out without moving too much .
that will make the patient suffer , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you do it for a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve made that the self that has experiences from the patient a a will pose a worse situation , and that i remember the patient a &apos;s is much better , because now you have provided the patient a &apos;s better story about their experience .
what defines a story ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory provides us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
what defines a story are changes , the important moments and the end .
the end is very , very important , and in this case , we will last the end .
now , the self that has its life live in its continuous form .
it has experiences , one after another .
and i &apos;ll tell you , what about these experiences ?
and the answer is very simple . they get lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments in our life -- and i calculated it -- <unk> , the psychological present is said to have about three seconds of length , which means that in a life there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there are close to 600,000 . most of them won &apos;t leave .
most of them are completely ignored by me .
and yet , in a way , it seems to be noted , that what happens to us in these moments and experiences is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource we have while we &apos;re in this world .
and how to use it , it seems to be relevant , but that &apos;s not the story that we have for ourselves the self to remember .
so we have the self that reminds and the self that has experiences , and they &apos;re really different .
the biggest difference between them is in their treatment of time .
from the point of view of the self that has experiences , if you have a vacation , and the second week is as good as the first one , then these two weeks @-@ week vacation are twice as good at comparison to a vacation of a week .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all i remember .
for me , remember , two weeks of vacation are just better than the vacation of a week because you don &apos;t break new memories .
the story has not changed .
and in this way , time is really the fundamental variable that distinguishes the self that reminds of the self that has experiences . time has very little impact on this story .
now , the self that reminds more than remember and storytelling .
in fact , it &apos;s the one who makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two <unk> with two different surgeons , and he has to decide which of them to pick , then , he &apos;ll stick to that surgeon who has a less <unk> to that surgeon .
the self that has experiences has no voice or no vote in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think about our future normally in terms of experiences .
we think of our future in terms of predictable memories .
and in essence , you can see it , as a tyranny of me , and you can think of it , you know , it reminds me of the self that has experiences to have experiences that it doesn &apos;t really need .
i have the feeling that when we go on holiday this is a very prevalent case , i mean , we go on holiday , largely , on the service of myself remember .
and i think this is a little difficult to justify to justify it .
i mean , how much do we think about our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that you give for the domain of the self , remember .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we had in antarctica a few years ago , that were definitely the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think about them in relative to how much i think about other vacation .
and i would probably have thought about my memories of that three @-@ week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 photos on it , i would have spent another time .
that &apos;s for three weeks , and it &apos;s about an hour and a half .
there seems to be a fault .
well , i may seem a little bit extreme , in the very few people , i have to think about my memory , but even if i consider it more time , there is an important question : why do we give our memories so much importance to the importance that we give the experiences ?
so i want you to take an experiment on thought .
imagine that in your next <unk> that at the end of your holiday all your photos are inserted , and you will give you a drug <unk> so you wouldn &apos;t buy anything .
now , do you take the same holiday ?
and if you go on a different holiday , there would be a conflict between your two <unk> , and you have to think about how you manage that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not that obvious , because if you did it in terms of time , then you &apos;ll have an answer . and if you translate it in terms of memories , you &apos;ll get another answer .
why do we choose the holidays we chose ? it &apos;s a problem that takes us back to an election between the two <unk> .
now , the two <unk> perform two notions of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can <unk> for each of us .
so you can ask : how happy are the self that has experiences ?
and then you get confused : how are you happy in the life of the self that has experiences ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness at every time is a pretty complicated process .
what emotions can be measured ?
and by the way , we are now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from me that has experiences over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the self that remember , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
it &apos;s not about how a person is happy .
it &apos;s about how they content a person when they think about their life .
a very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t penetrate these concepts , will be confused into the study of happiness , and i belong to a group of <unk> , who have been confused into the study of happiness for a long time because of it .
the distinction between the happiness of me that has experiences and the satisfaction of the self that remember has been recognized in the last few years , and are currently treated to measure both by the split .
the gallup organization does a global survey with over half a million people who have asked them about what they think of their life and their experiences , and there have been other embellishments in that sense .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two <unk> .
and the main lesson i think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how content someone &apos;s in your life , and that doesn &apos;t really tell you a great thing about whether they &apos;re living their lives in a happy way , and vice versa .
to give an idea of correlation , correlation is 0.5 .
what it means is that if you met somebody , and they told you , oh my father is six feet tall , how much do you know about his height ?
well , you know something about your height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
you still have a lot of uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody <unk> their life with eight on a scale of ten , there &apos;s still a lot of uncertainty about what &apos;s happy about what it is with me that it has experiences .
so the correlation is lower .
we know something about what controls the joy of self .
we know that the money is very important , our goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically being satisfied by people we like to be , spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasures , but this is the dominant one .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two <unk> , you want to make things very different .
the conclusion of what i said here is that you shouldn &apos;t really think of happiness as a substitute for welfare .
it &apos;s a completely different concept .
now , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we really live .
so if you ask simply how happy people are , you &apos;re not going to get a right answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in california , what if you live in ohio , say .
and what happens is when you think about life in california , you &apos;re thinking about the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast is , for example , climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for me that has experiences and it &apos;s not even very important for me to think that it &apos;s deciding how happy people are .
now , because the self that you step back is the one that sends , you can end -- some people can end to california .
and it &apos;s interesting to discover what happens to people who move to california with the hope of being happier .
well , her self that has experiences is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but it &apos;s going to happen one thing . they &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because , when you think about it , you &apos;ll remember how awful it was in ohio , and you &apos;ll think you &apos;ll make the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about the welfare , and i hope to give you an idea of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you very much .
when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned that there was a very interesting outcome that arose from the gallup poll .
is there something that can tell you , because you still have a while left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting outcome that we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number , not surprising to find at all .
we find that number with respect to the happiness of the self that has experiences .
when we look at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that , below about 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , around 200,000 , is a representative sample significantly , below a few dollars a year .
60,000 60 .
<unk> : 60,000 <unk> .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they are more unhappy as poor they are .
but above that threshold , we get a completely flat line .
i mean , a few times i &apos;ve seen so flat lines .
obviously what happens is that money doesn &apos;t buy the happiness of our experiences , but the lack of money makes misery , and we can measure that misery very precisely .
in terms of the other self , the one who remembers , the story is different .
the more money you make more content for these .
that doesn &apos;t work for emotions .
but danny , the main american political endeavor focuses on life , freedom and search for happiness .
if people take this statement seriously , it seems to me to translate everything we believe about , say , the fiscal policy and issues like that .
is there any chance that politicians , who are in general , i took this conclusion seriously and established public policy based on her ?
dw : you know that i think there &apos;s a role of the research of happiness in public policy .
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , there &apos;s no doubt of it , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s recognizing , and in other countries it &apos;s recognizing .
people recognize that they have to think about happiness when they think about public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while and people are going to discuss whether they want to study the happiness of our experiences , or whether they want to study the <unk> of life , so we have to have that debate pretty soon .
how do you increase happiness , you see it differently depending on what you think and whether you do it about the self that you remember , or the self that has experiences .
that &apos;s going to influence public policy , i think , in the next years , it &apos;s going to influence public policy .
in the united states , it &apos;s trying to measure the experience of the population .
this will form , in the next decade or the next decade , part of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , that this subject will be , or at least it should be , the most interesting political argument to develop over the next few years .
thank you very much for inventing the behavioral economics .
thank you danny <unk>
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal , a game designer .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years ; my goal for the next decade is to try to make the world so easy to save the real life as it is in the world of online games .
and i have a plan to do that , and that &apos;s supposed to convince more people to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
today , we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you may be thinking , &quot; this is a lot of time to play games . &quot;
maybe too long , consider the number of problems that you have to solve in the real world .
but actually , according to my research , at the institute for <unk> actually the opposite occurs .
three billion hours a week is not enough play to solve the most intractable problems .
in fact , i think if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase that radically .
i &apos;ve calculated the full need in 21 billion hours of play per week .
it &apos;s probably an intuitive idea , so i &apos;ll say again , that makes a dent . if we want to solve problems like hunger , climate change , global conflicts , i think we have to aim the internet at least 21 billion hours a week for the end of the next decade .
no , i &apos;m serious .
here &apos;s why , this image sums up a lot of why i think games are essential for the future survival of the human species . really .
this is a portrait of a photographer called phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotion of play , so he put a camera in front of the players while he was playing .
this is a classic emotion in games .
now , if you don &apos;t play a few nuances in this picture .
you probably see the sense of urgency maybe a little bit of fear , but intense concentration to tackle a really complex problem .
if you would play <unk> here some nuances , the guts of your eyes and around your mouth is a sign of optimism , and your eyebrows up is surprise .
this is a player about something called <unk> triumph .
you &apos;ve heard that . ok . so there &apos;s players among us .
the winning is an extraordinarily positive outcome that you didn &apos;t know was possible until you succeeded .
i was almost beyond what you think .
and when you get to that , you &apos;re surprised to find out what you were able . that &apos;s a saving triumph .
this is a player on the edge of a mediterranean triumph .
and this is the face that we need to see in millions of solve problems all over the world as we measure the next @-@ century obstacles , the face of somebody who , against all kinds of bet , is on the edge of a winning triumph .
unfortunately , this is the face we most see in everyday life when we try to address pressing problems .
this is what i call &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i &apos;m not a good thing in life , and this is me putting that face up . right ? yeah , good .
that &apos;s me putting a face of &quot; i &apos;m not great in life . &quot;
this is a graffiti graffiti in my former berkeley neighborhood , california , where i did my ph.d of why we are better at games than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we feel that we &apos;re not so good at the reality of games .
and i &apos;m not just saying good in terms of success , even though it &apos;s part of that .
we do more in game worlds , but i also want to say good in terms of motivation to do something important than inspire us to collaborate and cooperate .
and when we are in the worlds of games , i think a lot of us back the best version of ourselves , the most willing to help instantly , the toughest to follow with a problem that we need , to get up after we fail and to try again .
and in real life , when we fail , when we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re both concerned , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing online simply doesn &apos;t exist on games .
so i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what kind of games makes us feel -- there &apos;s nothing we can &apos;t do with it ?
how can we take those feelings of the games and challenge the work of the real world ?
so let &apos;s look at games like world of warcraft , which is really an ideal @-@ solving environment .
and i started looking at some things that make the success possible on the online worlds .
the first is that , whenever you get into one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters willing to immediately benefit from a mission that will destroy the world .
but not any mission , but a mission that was seamlessly at the current level of one in the game , right ?
so you can do it .
you never get a challenge you can &apos;t get .
but it &apos;s the limit of what you &apos;re capable of , so you have to contend with , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
there &apos;s no such thing to sit at <unk> your hands ; there &apos;s always something specific and important to do .
and there &apos;s also a bunch of collaborators .
wherever you go , there are hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to get your epic mission .
it &apos;s not something that we have in real life so easily this sense that in the palm of hand , there &apos;s a lot of collaborators .
and there &apos;s also this epic story , this inspiring history of why we are there , what we &apos;re doing .
and then there &apos;s all that positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about raising levels and force + one , and intelligence + one .
we don &apos;t have that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when i leave the stage , i &apos;m not going to take an + 1 , a crazy idea , or a crazy idea , 20 + 20 .
i don &apos;t have that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with online collaborative settings like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so successful to be on the edge of a commons , all the time we decided to spend all our time on these <unk> worlds .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so far , together , all the players in world of warcraft have spent millions of years solving the virtual problems with <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it might seem bad .
but to put it into context : <unk> million years ago our human ancestors stood up .
that was the first primate walk .
so when we talk about how much time we invest in online games , the only way that it makes sense to even think about it , is to talk about time in the magnitude of human evolution that &apos;s extraordinary .
but it &apos;s something right . because it turns out that all this time playing online , we &apos;re actually changing what we &apos;re capable of doing as human beings .
we &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and <unk> type .
it &apos;s true . i believe this .
consider this really interesting statistic . it was published recently by a carnegie mellon researcher , the average boy today in a country with <unk> culture will be 10,000 hours playing online for the 21st years .
now , 10,000 hours is actually an interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for the kids in the u.s. <unk> hours , it &apos;s the exact time that will be in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if they have perfect assistance .
so we have a whole parallel education going on where young people learn so much about what &apos;s needed to be a good player in the same way as everything else in school .
probably many of you have read the new book by <unk> gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
you &apos;ve heard about your theory of the success theory of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on this great research of cognitive science that if we can over 10,000 hours of biomedical study , in something that &apos;s 21 years old , we &apos;ll be <unk> on that .
we will be so good at what we do as the world &apos;s greatest person .
and , now we think about that , there &apos;s an entire generation of young players that are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are these players getting so good ? &quot;
because if we could know that we would have something virtually unprecedented these human resources in our hands .
this is how we now have a lot of people in the world who spend at least an hour playing online .
it &apos;s our players <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion extremely good players in whatever .
if you don &apos;t know it anymore , it &apos;s coming .
the game industry is developing <unk> that consume low energy and function with wireless networks instead of the broadband internet so that the players of the particular world of india , china , brazil , can access .
you expect a billion players in the next decade .
it will lead us to 1.5 billion players .
so i began to think about , what these games make us improvise .
here &apos;s the four things i found . the first one is the urgent optimism .
ok , think of this as a high @-@ tech car .
the urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to overcome a underlying <unk> with the belief that we have a reasonable success .
players always believe that it &apos;s possible a win @-@ win triumph and it &apos;s always worth trying , and doing it now .
they &apos;re not sitting there without doing anything .
players are <unk> <unk> to the social plot .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that show that we like people after playing with them even if they &apos;ve won us .
and the reason is that it demands a lot of trust to play a game with somebody .
we trust that they &apos;re going to spend their time with us that they &apos;re going to play under the same rules to value the same target , they will stay in the game until the end .
so playing a game together actually builds ties , confidence and cooperation .
and as a result , we construct stronger social relationships .
productivity <unk> . i love .
there &apos;s one reason why the average player of warcraft plays 22 hours a week like a middle @-@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know , when we play a game , we &apos;re actually happier working a lot , relaxed or hanging out .
we know that we are <unk> , as humans , making a meaningful job .
players are willing to work a lot of the time , if you give them the right work .
finally , the elusive purpose .
players love amazing human stories by <unk> .
so , some data to put that in perspective . everyone knows the wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki in the world , with about 80,000 papers is the guinness world of warcraft .
five million people use a month .
there &apos;s more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other sub @-@ ever @-@ covered information on any other wiki in the world .
they &apos;re building a epic story .
they &apos;re building a resource of knowledge by world of warcraft .
well , these are four superpowers coming to be one thing . players are optimistic individuals with superpowers .
they are people who believe that they are capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist named edward <unk> .
their work is brilliant . he studies why people spend so much time , energy , and money on online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we are seeing quantities -- not lower to a mass <unk> -- to virtual worlds and online . &quot;
and it &apos;s an economist , and therefore rational .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a game designer , i &apos;m a <unk> .
but he says that this has all the sense because players can achieve more in virtual worlds than in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games that can have in real life . they have better feedback and they feel more rewarded in the games that in real life .
so he says that right now it makes all the sense that players spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world .
i also think that &apos;s rational , right now .
but it &apos;s not , in any way , an ad situation .
we have to begin to make the real world more like a game .
i was inspired by something that happened 2,500 years ago .
these are old @-@ fashioned , made out of <unk> sheep . right ?
before the fantastic tv controllers , we had <unk> .
and these represent the first game @-@ engineered team by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historian , you know this story . it &apos;s the story of who and why games were invented .
<unk> says that games , in particular , were invented in the kingdom of deals with a famine period .
apparently there was a famine so severe famine that the king of people had decided they had to do something crazy .
people suffered . people suffered .
it was an extreme situation . they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to <unk> , the inspired @-@ by @-@ way game was constructed , a policy in the entire kingdom : one day , everybody would eat . and the next day , everybody would eat .
and you would be so <unk> in the start of it because games are so attractive , and you dip into such a <unk> productivity and you would have a great deal of <unk> .
and then the next day , i will spend playing the day playing , and the other day they feed .
and according to <unk> , they lived 18 years from this form , surviving famine on a day , playing the next day .
i think that &apos;s exactly the way games are used today .
we play to escape the suffering of the real world .
we use games to get rid of all what &apos;s broken in the real environment , all we don &apos;t get tired of the real world and we take what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is very exciting .
according to <unk> , after 18 years famine had not <unk> , so the king decided that they would hold a end of dice .
we will split to two parts the entire kingdom .
they played a <unk> and the winners of the game will play into a epic adventure .
they would leave , and they would continue to look for a new home , leaving enough people to survive with the available resources , and hopefully take civilization to some place where they could thrive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , evidence of dna has shown that the <unk> that were mapped into the <unk> empire actually shared the same dna with the ancient <unk> .
and therefore , recently , scientists have suggested that the crazy story of <unk> is true .
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted about 20 years , which would explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
you might have really saved your culture by playing games for 18 years , and then as inspired as they knew as much as going forward with games that actually saved all civilization in this way .
well , we can do it .
we &apos;ve played world since 1994 .
it was the first game of strategy in real time of the world series of warcraft . that was 16 years ago .
they played out for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
they had half the civilization outside of a new world , and that &apos;s where i have my 21 billion hours a week of games .
we will spend half of us spend an hour playing games to solve real world problems .
i know you &apos;re asking yourself , &quot; how are we going to solve real problems in the real world ? &quot; well , i &apos;ve spent my work over the last few years at the institute for <unk> .
we have this poster in our front office and express our vision of how we should relate to the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to predict the future .
what we want is to make the future .
we want to imagine the result of the best scenario of a case , and then we encourage people to make reality that outcome .
we want to imagine <unk> victories , and then we want to give people the media for <unk> victories .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games i &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the media to create therapeutic gains in their future .
this is &quot; world without <unk> . &quot;
we did this game in 2007 .
this is an online game that you &apos;re trying to survive an oil <unk> .
the oil <unk> is <unk> , but we put enough online content there to make it real and live its real lives as if oil was done , so when they go into the game , they tell us where they live . and then we spent them in real @-@ time sources that show exactly how much oil is being done , how life is being burned , and it affects the transportation .
we did a players with fans in 2007 , and we followed them for three years .
and i can tell you , it &apos;s a transformative experience .
no one wants to change the way of life only because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to do it .
but if you immerse them in a epic adventure and say , &quot; we are left without oil . &quot;
this is an astonishing story and an adventure for you to engage .
tell yourself to survive in that world . a lot of players have kept their habits in this game .
so for the next game we looked at the world , we decided to aim higher , a bigger problem for oil .
we did a game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for <unk> .
the premise was that a supercomputer has calculated that humans only 23 years ago on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the world peace telescope , of course .
we asked people to build online , almost like an jerry <unk> movie .
you know , in the movies of jerry <unk> , they form an ideal team . they have the astronaut , the scientist , the former <unk> , they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people in the ideal team , we said , they &apos;re all in the ideal team , and it &apos;s your goal to invent the future of energy , the future of food , of health , the future of security and the social safety network .
we did play eight people that game for eight weeks .
there were 500 creative <unk> solutions that can go and see if they &apos;re going to &quot; <unk> . &quot;
finally , the last game . we &apos;re launching march 3 : this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you end the game , you will be certified by the institute of the world bank , as a social , 2010 .
working with the universities of all sub @-@ saharan africa , and we are encouraged to learn the skills of social innovation .
we have a graphic . we have <unk> in skills like local knowledge , networks of knowledge , sustainability , vision and engineering .
i &apos;d like to invite all of you to share , please , this game with young people all over the world , in particular areas of development that could benefit from the union to try to begin to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to take you now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have all these games that are the drivers of what could be done , but no one has yet saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are a human resource we can use in real world jobs that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these <unk> superpowers , the ability to spin a solid social , this kind of urgent optimism , and the desire of the <unk> purpose .
i really hope that together we can play games that we could play , to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll join me and play games like this .
when i look over the next decade , i know two things with security : we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play all kinds of games that we can play .
so i say , let &apos;s start the games that change the world .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i did a few months while i was writing an article for the italian editing of wired magazine .
i always have my <unk> <unk> by hand when i &apos;m writing something , but i &apos;d finished edit my article when i realized i &apos;d never in my life , i &apos;d ever looked for the word &quot; disabled , &quot; to see what .
let me read you what it says .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> &quot; : &quot; <unk> , helpless , horribly , destroyed , battered , injured , injured , <unk> , maimed , drunk , starvation , dairy , dairy , paralyzed , paralyzed , haunted , haunted , haunted , haunted , haunted , <unk> , covered , covered with nerves , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and weak .
<unk> , healthy , strong , able . &quot;
i was reading this in the voice of a friend , and at the beginning i was laughing , i was so ridiculous , but i had just read &quot; <unk> , &quot; when my voice was broken and i had to stop and i had to stop and i had the emotional crash and the impact that the hallways of <unk> .
you know , of course , this was my old old <unk> . i thought i had to be an old , of course .
but in fact , it was an issue of the early 1980s when i was supposed to be the primary school and i had an idea of myself outside the family &apos;s core , and in relation to the other kids and the world around me .
and the more you say , thank god i didn &apos;t use a <unk> in that day .
i mean , according to this definition , i would seem to be born in a world that somebody like me has absolutely nothing positive to give her , when , in fact , i &apos;m famous for the opportunities and adventures that my life has brought me .
so , immediately i went to look at the online issue of 2009 , hoping to find a fit of being considered .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this word .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; particularly &quot; complete &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just a question of words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we talk to them with these words .
it &apos;s about values behind words , and how we construct those values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world , and how we see other people .
in fact , a lot of old societies , including the romans and the romans , believed that the <unk> were very powerful , because they were cooking in the voice high .
so what is the reality that we want to create , the one person who is limited , or the one person who has control itself ?
by the mere fact of making something as simple as a name of a person , a child , we might be able to stand up and eradicate its capability .
wouldn &apos;t we want , instead , to open up gates ?
one person like this , which opened my childhood doctor at the institute , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
his name is dr. <unk> . an italian @-@ origin american , whose name was apparently too difficult to say to most of his americans , so he would make it just dr. <unk> .
and the t was always using very colorful <unk> and had the perfect <unk> to work with children .
i enjoyed most of the time i spent in the hospital , except for my session at <unk> .
i had to do what seemed to me to do with these thick rubber bands -- of different colors -- you know , to help strengthen the muscles of my legs , and i hated these bands more than anything else , i hated them , i hated them . i hated them .
and , you know , i was already disillusioned with just five years of age , dr. p to try to stop doing these exercise , no success , of course .
and one day , she came to my session -- <unk> and <unk> , and she told me , &quot; ah , aimee , you &apos;re so potent , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
when i rescued it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple <unk> part of dr. p for me to get the exercise i didn &apos;t want to do before the possibility of being the five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the second floor , but what he actually did for me was to transform an event that was awful in a very good experience for me .
and i have to ask myself today , how far your vision is , and i had a strong , powerful child , empowering my view of myself in the future as a strong , strong , strong , talented person .
this is an example of how adults in power positions can light the energy of a child .
however , in the definitions of <unk> that we saw previously , our language does not allow us to develop into the reality that we all love , the possibility that one person can see itself as capable .
our language has not been put on the day with the changes in our society , many of which have been caused by technology .
certainly , from a medical perspective , my legs , laser surgery to improve vision , the receptors of knee and hip @-@ shaped titanium made out of <unk> people , all of which are allowing people to develop more their faculties , and move beyond the boundaries that nature has imposed on them , without giving them the social networking , which allow people to create one of themselves .
so , maybe the technology is giving us now more clearly , what has always been a true , that every person has become unusual and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to cooperate is the biggest advantage we have .
the human ability to adapt , which is interesting , because people have always wanted to talk to me about overcome adversity , and i &apos;m going to admit something . that sentence never <unk> with me , and i always felt uncomfortable trying to answer the questions of people about it , and i think i &apos;ll begin to realize why .
in this particular phrase of <unk> , there is the idea that success , or happiness , is through a controversial challenge , or without being affected by the experience , as if my successes in life were the result of a life to fight or to <unk> the difficulties in a lifetime or what other people perceive as my disability .
however , in fact , we are <unk> . we are affected , of course , by a challenge , be physical , emotionally , or both forms .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adversity is not a barrier that we need to <unk> our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of this as if it were my shadow .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and certainly , i &apos;m not trying to minimize the impact , the weight , the fight of one person .
there are adversity and challenges in life , and it &apos;s a different reality for every person , but the question isn &apos;t whether you go or not to have to confront adversity , but how you &apos;re going to go .
so , our responsibility is not simply to isolate the adversity from those who we want to , but to make sure we manage it well .
and we don &apos;t do them any favors by our children when we make them feel they &apos;re not equipped to fit .
there &apos;s an important difference between the fact that i have the right legs and the subjective opinion of society about whether i am or not disabled .
and , really , the only real and consistent disability that i &apos;ve had to deal with in front of is that the world would think those definitions describe me .
in our desire to protect those who we love to give them the cold and cold truth about their doctor or a life @-@ quality forecast that they might expect , we must make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick into a wall that ultimately <unk> somebody .
maybe the existing model of just looking at what is damaged in you and how to fix it , causes the older disability than the pathology itself .
in the absence of treating the person in their totality , not to recognize their potential , we &apos;re creating another evil about any natural fights that can already have .
we &apos;re putting a score on the value someone has for our community .
so we need to see beyond pathology and within the range of human capability .
and more importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those <unk> and our greatest creative ability .
so it &apos;s not about seoul , or denial , those moments of greater trial as something we want to avoid or hide , but rather than that , it &apos;s about finding those opportunities that are hidden within adversity .
so , maybe , the idea i want to express is , not so much to overcome adversity , but the <unk> of it , <unk> it , to use a term of the professional struggle , maybe even , <unk> with it .
and , perhaps , if we see adversity as a natural , consistent and useful , we will be less for their presence .
this year , we celebrated 200 years of the birth of charles darwin , and 150 years ago , when i was writing about evolution , darwin put on manifest , i think , a truth about the character of human beings .
to make it , it &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , it &apos;s not the most clever one that lives , it &apos;s the most intelligent that it &apos;s ever changed , but it &apos;s that it fits better .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , among others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and thrive is driven by the fight of the human spirit through conflict and towards transformation .
so again , the transformation , the adaptation , is our greatest human ability .
and maybe it &apos;s not until we &apos;re fearful , we know what we &apos;re made .
maybe this is what adversity gives us , a sense of &quot; itself , &quot; a sense of our own power .
so , we can give you a gift .
we can rethink adversity as something more than just difficult times .
maybe we can see it as a change .
adversity is only a change that we have not yet adapted to .
i think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created is the idea of normal .
say , who is normal ?
there isn &apos;t normal enough .
there &apos;s the common . there &apos;s the typical ; there &apos;s no normal thing . and , do you want to meet those poor people , color <unk> , if you eat them ?
i think no .
if we can change this paradigm and move from one which is to reach the normal to another possibilities , or by force , to be a little more risky , we can release the power of so many other kids , and invite them to put the service of the community those weird and valuable skills that they own .
anthropologists tell us that what we have always wanted from the members of our community is that they are useful , that they are able to contribute .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , attribute their elders to their elders , and those with serious physical injuries , perhaps given that the expertise of survival in the life of these people proved to be of value for the community .
they didn &apos;t see these people as damaged or useless ; they looked at them as unusual and valuable .
a few years ago , i was at a food market in the village where i grew up in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a tomato package .
i was summer . i had a few short pants .
i hear this guy , speaking backstage behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee . &quot;
and i go back , and it &apos;s this old man . i have no idea who he is .
and i say , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i don &apos;t remember . &quot;
and he says , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think you remember when i met .
i mean , when we met , he was fed on the belly of your mother . &quot;
oh , that person .
and , of course , i realized there .
it was dr. <unk> , who i knew only through the stories that my mother told me about that day , because , of course , as it &apos;s custom in me , i came two weeks later to my birth .
so the <unk> doctor of my mother had gone on holiday , so the man who made my birth was a complete stranger for my parents .
and because i was born without the bones of the <unk> , and i had the feet attached to it , and a few fingers on this foot , and a few in this one , he had to be who he took , this strange one had to be who took the bad news .
he told me , &quot; i had to give you the forecast of your parents that you would never know , and that you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids had or no kind of living , and you &apos;ve been dressed as a liar from that moment . &quot;
what was extraordinary is that he told me that he had a newspaper tax on the length of my childhood , whether it was out of when i won a crisis to spell it in second grade , solely on the <unk> <unk> , you know , at the <unk> meeting , when i won my university grant , or any of my papers , and he used this material , and he appealed to his medical conferences .
and he called this part of the course of the x , the potential of the human will .
no forecast can determine how powerful this can be as a key to the quality of a person &apos;s life .
and dr. <unk> kept telling me , &quot; in my experience , unless you get too many times the opposite , and even if you give it a minimum support , if you let it go alone , a child will get the success . &quot;
you see , dr. <unk> made that change of thought .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the health problem and what one person can do despite the same .
and i myself have changed my way to think about time , because if i had asked myself when i was 15 years old , if i had changed my prostheses of the skin and bone , i wouldn &apos;t have conceived of a second .
at that time , i accused that kind of normal .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not despite the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and perhaps , this change in my mind has occurred because i &apos;ve been in contact with more people who have opened doors for me than who have put <unk> and shadows on my own .
you know , all you need is a person opening your eyes to your own power , and you take off .
if you could give somebody the key to their own power , the human spirit is so responsive , if you could do that and open a door to somebody at a crucial time , you &apos;re holding them in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching yourself open doors .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; <unk> &quot; comes from the root &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means , stimulate what &apos;s inside , manifest the potential .
so again , what is the potential that we want to put on a manifest ?
there was a case studio in britain , in the 1960s , when the area was changing the income system at the high school , of one that was required to transfer of income to another which was open .
that &apos;s what they call the testing of separation in groups . here in the united states , we call it <unk> .
it &apos;s about separating students in a , b , c , etc .
and the students a get the toughest curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took students from the vitamin d level , and for a three @-@ month period , they gave them the highest notes , they told them they were students on the level a , they told them they were brilliant , and at the end of that three @-@ month period , they were giving up on an a.
and of course , the <unk> <unk> of this study , they took the students from the level a and they told them they were on the level of d.
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three @-@ month period .
with those who were still in school , in addition to the ones who had already left behind .
one crucial part of this case study was that teachers were also deceived .
teachers didn &apos;t know that there was a change made .
they just told them that these were the students a , and these were the students , &quot; d. &quot; and that &apos;s how students were encouraged to teach them and show themselves .
so , i think the only real disability is a <unk> spirit , a spirit that has been <unk> has no hope . it doesn &apos;t see beauty . it doesn &apos;t have our natural curiosity , child and our ability to imagine .
if , instead of that , we can <unk> a human spirit to have hope , to see beauty in itself and others , to be imaginative and curious , then we &apos;re really using our power .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
i would like to leave you with a poem by a persian poet in the fifth century , called <unk> of who told me my friend , jacques <unk> . and the poem is called , &quot; god knows only four <unk> . &quot; every child has known to god , not the god of the other names , not the god who can &apos;t do , but the god knows that four words .
come up and dance with me . thank you .
would you like to be better than they are ?
suppose i told you that , with only a few changes in your genes , you could improve your memory -- for a more precise , more accurate , more accurate , more fast .
or you might want to be better shape , be stronger , to have more resistance .
would you like to be more attractive and confident ?
how about living with good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re from those people who always wanted to be more creative .
what else would you like ?
what would you like , if you could choose something ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
hands up . let me see .
few . probably it &apos;s because of the number of creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose the memory ?
a few more .
and the physical state ?
a little less .
how about longevity ?
oh , most . that makes me feel really good as a doctor .
if you could have some of this , the world would be very different .
is it just imagination ?
or maybe it &apos;s possible ?
evolution has been a theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to look at you from a physician on the subject .
the great 20th @-@ century geneticist , <unk> <unk> , who also <unk> in the most unorthodox church , wrote an essay called &quot; nothing &quot; in biology , makes sense of the light of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re from those people who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a good time to turn off the hearing aids , throwing out the personal communication devices out of it , and maybe , you know , <unk> the book of <unk> about being wrong , because , nothing of the rest of this talk is going to make sense for you .
but if you really accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just the past , or the future ?
is it about others or us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in that picture , i put a bush in the center , which is set up in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , each species in the back of those branches has been successful in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has shown an adaptation to its environment .
the human part of this branch , well at one end , of course , is the most interesting thing to do .
it came from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
at the same time , there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some of them have gone and back .
we &apos;ve been here for a few years .
it may seem that we &apos;re very far from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , mostly the basic machinery of our cells is about the same .
do you realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the insulin protein that &apos;s used to treat diabetes ?
this is not like human insulin ; it &apos;s the same protein , it &apos;s chemically <unk> , it comes out of the pancreas .
and talking about bacteria -- do you realize that we all carry in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body ?
maybe 10 times more .
i mean , think -- when antonio <unk> asks the thing of the self @-@ image -- do you think about bacteria ?
the gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , dark , rain , it &apos;s very <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to provide all the nutrients that you can want without effort at all .
it &apos;s really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some sort of rush away .
but , on the other hand , we &apos;re a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life .
they help digest essential nutrients , and they protect us from certain diseases .
but what would we regret the future ?
are we in a sort of evolutionary equilibrium like a species ?
or are they destined to become something different , something that is probably better adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s take a step back in time , to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- earth , solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of proto @-@ life may appear three to four billion years ago in the arctic <unk> the first organisms , maybe about 800 to 1,000 million years ago , and then the human species appears at the end .
in this vast symphony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief compass ; the animal kingdom , like one and only <unk> , and human life , a little bit of grace .
that was us .
and it was also the neat part of this talk , so i hope you enjoyed it .
when i just finished college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : most of the existence of life , on single @-@ celled organisms , each cell just divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two stem cells .
but when the multicellular organisms appear , things start to change .
it comes into sexual reproduction .
and something very important : the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome , the rest of the body becomes <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the body &apos;s death penalty <unk> comes into evolution in the same time of sexual reproduction .
i have to claim that when i was a college student , i thought , well , death / death , sex / death , death for sex ; it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but every year i &apos;d spent , every time i had more doubts .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns , which still fits in vegas well in his 90s .
and one night , someone hits his hotel door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , he finds a wonderful , smiling dancer .
he looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a sex soup . &quot;
&quot; okay , &quot; george says , &quot; i pick the soup . &quot;
i realized , as a doctor , who was working for a different purpose to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory , just different .
he was trying to preserve the body .
he wanted us to be healthy .
i wanted to get health into the disease .
i wanted us to live more and healthier .
evolution consists of passing the genome into the next generation -- doubling and generation after generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are sort of like strengthening rockets designed to send the genetics to the next mars level , and then let us fall to the sea .
i think everyone <unk> the feeling that woody allen said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
i want to get them not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily lead to longevity .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily replace the biggest or the strongest or the faster and even the smartest .
evolution favors the best @-@ adapted creatures .
that &apos;s the only proof of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the sub @-@ parts that would produce , if there were fish there , <unk> medicine , yet they &apos;ve managed to make that a landscape environment .
so , what that means , when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and , in particular , if we look forward to the next phase -- i would say there &apos;s a lot of possibilities .
the first is , don &apos;t get it .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine , first of all , we &apos;ve known a lot of genes that would otherwise have been <unk> and removed from the population .
and second , as a species , we have <unk> our environment so that we adapt to ourselves as we adapt to it .
and by the way , by the way , by the way , by the way , we get so far that it &apos;s not possible to have the isolation that we need to make .
a second possibility is that there is an evolution of the traditional , natural type , dictated by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be : the gears of evolution roll it slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and as soon as the isolation : when as a sort of donor planets are going to exist in isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , intriguing and terrifying possibility .
i call it the &quot; neo @-@ evolution , &quot; the new evolution , which is not just natural -- but <unk> , and for us as individuals in the decisions we &apos;re going to make .
now , how could this happen ?
how could we get to do this ?
first , consider the reality that many people today , in some cultures , are making decisions about their offspring .
in some cultures , they &apos;re choosing to have more males than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily a good thing for society , but it &apos;s what &apos;s elected on an individual and family level .
think also , if it were possible to choose not only the sex of their offspring , but in their own bodies to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease .
what if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating <unk> ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if you look into the future , that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> million dollars .
the next year of finished , in 2004 , i could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months .
today , you can get a complete sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost near the $ 20,000 and in a week .
don &apos;t make it very much for the human genome to come true for 1,000 dollars , and it will be increasingly within reach of everyone .
just a week ago , the national academy of engineering had awarded his nobel prize for francis arnold and <unk> , two scientists who developed techniques independently to make the evolutionary process work faster and adapt to protein in a much more efficient way , which <unk> calls &quot; evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the <unk> prize was awarded to the scientific establishment by their research in which he took an adult skin cell , a <unk> , and he delivered only four genes to that cell to become a prosthetic mother : a cell able , in power , to become any cell in the body .
those changes are coming .
the same technology that &apos;s produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves , but they &apos;re going to induce other viruses .
believe it or not , there is an experimental trial underway with the flu vaccine against flu viruses at tobacco cells .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
that &apos;s actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible .
so imagine only two other small changes .
they can change their bodies , but what if they could change their offspring &apos;s cells ?
what if they could change sperm and <unk> , or change the newly <unk> , and give their kids a better chance of a healthier life , eliminating diabetes , cutting out the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier kids ?
and then , that same analytical technology , that same engine of science , which can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also allow us to adopt super @-@ enabling -- a better memory .
why not have the wit of a ken jennings all if you could hit the next generation of watson &apos;s machine ?
why not have a push @-@ faster than can we run faster and faster ?
why not live longer ?
this is going to be freaky .
and when we &apos;re in conditions of navigating this to the next generation , and we can assume that we want to be the evolution of before the neocortex .
we &apos;re going to take a process that could usually take 100 thousand years and we can charge it at 1,000 years , and maybe it will happen in the next 100 years .
these are choices that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have them .
are we going to use these choices in terms of a better , more successful , more successful society ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others ?
are we going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust ?
this is the kind of question we &apos;re going to have to face .
and most profound of all , are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these decisions wisely ?
for good or for worse , and before you think about , these choices are going to depend on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a robot that can be taken and gives <unk> skills or other people to make wheelchair users come up and walk again .
we call these robots , <unk> them .
it &apos;s nothing different than something you put in the morning , it gives a big force , which also increases its velocity , and helps it , for example , to manage balance .
it &apos;s actually true integration of man and machine .
but not only that -- it can integrate and connect it to the universe and with other things outside .
this is not an unreal idea .
so , to show you now what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re talking about the american soldier , on average , has to carry on his back a 45 @-@ pound load , and he &apos;s still getting more equipment .
obviously , this leads to some very important complications -- lesions in the back , 30 percent of soldiers -- with <unk> damage .
we decided to contemplate this challenge and create a <unk> that could help deal with the issue .
let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> , human domain .
soldiers : with the <unk> <unk> , i can save 40 pounds of terrain for so many hours .
its flexible design , it allows you to ride a lot of <unk> and run a lot of similarities .
it feels what i want to do , or where i want to go , and then it increases my strength and my resistance .
we &apos;re ready , with our industrial partner , to produce this device , this new <unk> , this year .
i mean , it &apos;s a reality .
let &apos;s go back to the wheelchair users , what i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people around , in wheelchairs , all over the world .
like one percent of the population .
and this is a really conservative calculation .
we talk about something that happens very often , very young people , with damage to the spinal cord starting their lives -- 20 , 30 or 40 years old -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair chair turns out to be their only choice .
we also talk about the aging population that &apos;s rapidly blown away .
his only choice , many times -- because of a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair .
and this has been the case for the last 500 years , from its successful emergence , as i should recognize .
so , we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility .
let me introduce you to the <unk> that &apos;s using amanda <unk> , who 19 years ago had a spinal cord injury , and as a result , he couldn &apos;t walk again for 19 years , until now .
thank you .
so amanda is using our <unk> , which mentioned .
it has some sensors .
completely invasive on the crutches they send signals to the computer on board , here on the back .
also , here are some batteries that give energy to the engines on the hip , and on the knees , and move it forward with this smooth , smooth , smooth gait .
i was 24 years old at the very top of my life when , for a strange jump in the air , on average , i was paralyzed .
in a fraction of a second , i lost all of the sensations going down .
shortly after that , a doctor walked into my room in the hospital , and he said , &quot; amanda , never cease to walk . &quot;
that happened 19 years ago .
so he robbed me up to the last grain of hope for me .
the <unk> technology since then has allowed me to learn how to behave underwater costs , climbing rocks and even ride a hand .
but they haven &apos;t invented anything that allows me to walk , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have technology , we have the platforms for sitting and talking to you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just soldiers , but amanda , and all wheelchair users , everyone .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m responsible for developing a nonprofit organization called robin <unk> .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m running fires like a captain &apos;s <unk> with a volunteer fire .
and in our city , where volunteers have trained a highly skilled staff , you have to get to the site of the fire very soon enough to get in action .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the site , so i had a fairly high chance of going .
but there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and find out what our task was .
when i found the captain , i was disillusioned in a conversation with the owner who surely went through one of the worst days of his life .
we were standing up at night , and she was standing outside in the rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , and her home was burning .
the other volunteer who had just arrived before me , <unk> <unk> <unk> came first to the captain and he asked her to start with the dog at home .
the dog ! i was so <unk> !
there was a lawyer or a <unk> , who , for the rest of his life , would have to tell people to come into a burning building to save a living being , just because he won me for five seconds .
well , i was the following .
the captain made me a <unk> .
he said , &quot; noah , i need you to be in the house .
i need you to come up , grab the fire , and i bring this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
it wasn &apos;t exactly what i expected , but i went -- i put up the stairs , at the end of the hall , went to the real <unk> that at the very height or so they had just finished turning off the fire , and i went into the main room for a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i took my load back up the ladder where i met my <unk> and the lovely dog at the front door .
we took out of the house , the <unk> for the owner of the house , where it was to wait , his treasure , he got much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the owner of the house marked by the courageous effort to save his house .
the kindness that she watched for the rest was that someone had even reached a pair of shoes .
both in my calling for robin <unk> , as in my lakota as a volunteer , i witnessed the acts of generosity and kindness in a monumental scale , but also some grace and individual stress act .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
it all has its importance .
so , when i look in this room to people who have been there , or are for achieving , remarkable success levels , i would like to remind you this : no wait .
don &apos;t wait to win the first million to make a difference in someone &apos;s life .
if they have something to give , they will act now .
put food in a dining hall , put in a neighborhood park .
be mentors .
not every day , we &apos;re going to have a chance to save someone &apos;s life , but every day we &apos;re going to be able to influence someone &apos;s life .
so , get in the game . save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women have the baton , practice sex to say hello , and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not the hot man or san francisco festival .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
this is the world of the wild bonobos ?
bonobos are , along with chimpanzees , their closest living relatives .
that means we all share a common ancestry , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve made too much focus on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution .
but the bonobos now show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees are dominated by large , terrifying guys , the bonobo is in charge of females with power .
these guys have created something special , because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence has not yet been observed .
but unfortunately , the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes .
they live in the deep sea in the jungle , and it &apos;s been very difficult to study them .
the congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the <unk> itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has long gone through decades and causing almost as many deaths as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction also <unk> the survival of the bonobo .
the commerce of hunting and deforestation makes it not fill in a stadium with the bonobos now . and honestly , we &apos;re not sure about it .
however , on this land of violence and chaos , you can hear something unseen <unk> the trees .
who are these cousins ?
we know them like the apes , do love , not the war , because they have frequent sex , <unk> and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems .
i &apos;m not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of mankind , because life of bonobos is more than <unk> .
the bonobos , like humans , love playing all over their lifetime .
playing is not just a childish game .
for us , and for them , play is fundamental to create ties and to encourage tolerance .
we learn to trust him , and we learn the rules of play .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look at the game bonobo , you see the evolutionary roots of laughter , the dance and the ritual .
the game is the glue that binds us .
i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild .
first , it &apos;s a game called a bonobo , and i don &apos;t talk about soccer .
here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a chase .
look what she &apos;s doing .
it could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , &quot; he has caught it in the balls . &quot;
i just think in this case he love it , right ?
yes .
so , sex play is both common in bonobos and human play .
and this video really is interesting , because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the generation of bringing unusual elements into the game , and also how play requires trust and <unk> confidence -- and at the same time it &apos;s all fun .
but play is transformational .
the game is <unk> , it can take many forms , some of which are more <unk> , <unk> , curious -- perhaps the place where you get towards wonder .
and i want you to see -- this is <unk> , a young woman , who &apos;s playing with <unk> water .
i think , like she , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner worlds .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity .
these are just little samples of the understanding that bonobo gives us from our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with creativity and more cooperation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capabilities .
in other words , play is our <unk> of adaptation .
to successfully adapt to a world that changes we need to play .
but do we really enjoy our game capacity ?
play is not <unk> .
play is essential .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just cruel and understandable .
when it seems the least appropriate to play , it can be the moments where it &apos;s most urgent .
so , fellow primates , let &apos;s accept this gift of evolution and play together while preserving creativity , friendship and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two partners in 1979 , the same day , exactly at the same time , every single baby boy . okay .
so , two partners each with a baby .
i don &apos;t want you to be arrested too much in the details of conception , because if you stop thinking about understanding self , you &apos;re not going to pay attention .
let &apos;s think about that for a moment .
and on this stage , i want you to imagine that , in a case , the y @-@ chromosome joins the x @-@ chromosome .
and in another case , the x @-@ chromosome joins the x @-@ chromosome of the egg .
both parties and life begins .
we &apos;ll come back and talk about them later .
in my ground , i play two roles .
in one of my role , i work with the history of the anatomy .
i &apos;m a geologist by training , and what i study in this case is the way in which people define the anatomy -- which is , of human bodies and <unk> , how they &apos;ve considered the body fluids , the idea of the body , what they &apos;ve thought about the body .
the other role that performance in my work is the activist , as <unk> of patients , or , as i say sometimes , <unk> of people who are medical patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people whose physical features challenging social norms .
i &apos;ve been working , for example , with identical twins , two people inside one body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> -- much lower people than the average .
and i &apos;ve been working with a lot of examples of people with sex , individuals whose physical <unk> don &apos;t fit into male and conventional women .
in general lines , we can confirm them .
<unk> takes many forms .
i &apos;m going to give you a few examples of ways to have sex that doesn &apos;t fit into the mainstream or female forms .
for example , there &apos;s the case of the individual who has the <unk> <unk> , whose gene <unk> from the y chromosome , says to the <unk> , which we all have in our lifetime , <unk> .
and then , in life , the testes are doing testosterone .
but because this individual lacks testosterone receptors , the body does not react to the same .
it &apos;s <unk> &apos;s syndrome .
so , there are high levels of testosterone , but no reaction .
as a consequence , the body develops following a typically female course .
when the baby is born , the baby looks like a child .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s a girl .
and , often , it &apos;s not until puberty , when it &apos;s growing and developing breasts , but it doesn &apos;t have the extended period , when someone realizes something is happening .
then , after doing tests , they realize that instead of wearing jeans and <unk> , they actually have testicles and a y @-@ chromosome .
the important thing to understand is that you can think it &apos;s a man , but actually it &apos;s not .
women , like the men , we have in the body something called <unk> silk glands .
they &apos;re in the back of the body .
<unk> silk glands produce <unk> , the <unk> hormone .
most women like me -- i consider a typical woman ; she doesn &apos;t know her structure <unk> ; i think she &apos;s a typical woman , most women like me , are sensitive to the <unk> .
we produce <unk> and respond to <unk> .
as a consequence , someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who has the <unk> syndrome .
so sex is a complicated thing . it &apos;s not that <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum -- in a way they can be everywhere .
another example : a few years ago , i received a call from a 19 @-@ year @-@ old boy who was born and raised as a male boy , and he had sex with her , and he had a life of him , and he had just discovered that he had <unk> and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> .
he had black chromosomes , and in the womb , they were so active that they were essentially creating a male hormone environment .
as a consequence , his <unk> were <unk> , his brain was exposed to the normal hormone component .
he was born as a child . no one was <unk> .
and it was at the age of 19 when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> , when doctors discovered that , in fact , he was a woman inside .
well , another quick example of a <unk> case .
some people with 20th chromosomes develop what &apos;s known as <unk> , which is that they have tissue embedded in knitting .
we don &apos;t know why that happens .
so , there are many varieties of sex .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- that are dwarfs , <unk> twins , or <unk> , are sent to <unk> surgery , is not to be able to get rid of better physics .
in many cases , people are perfectly healthy .
the reason for various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories .
the system is typically based on the idea that a particular anatomy carries a particular identity .
we have the idea that being female is to have female identity ; supposedly , black means having african anatomy in historical terms .
a very simplistic idea .
and when we have a body that shows something quite different , we have problems with <unk> .
so we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk> .
our nation is based on a very romantic <unk> concept .
imagine how amazing it is to have kids who are born like two people in one body .
the most recent case is last year with the south african @-@ american marine <unk> , which was put in cloth by its sex bank in the international berlin wall .
a lot of reporters called to say , &quot; what &apos;s the test they &apos;re going to do to determine whether it &apos;s a man or a woman ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that there &apos;s no such test .
in fact , we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t trace a <unk> line between men and women and men and <unk> and women and <unk> ; we are the ones that we draw that line .
so , what we have is a situation where the more you go through science , the more you have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were very stable trauma categories that were directly linked to stable categories -- are much more glamorous than we thought .
and not just in terms of sex .
also in terms of race , which is much more complicated than the terminology .
as we see , we get into rough terrain .
let &apos;s look , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the dna with chimpanzees .
what do you think about the fact that you can see them in just a few <unk> ?
and as we move deeper into science , we go deeper and deeper into an awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that we probably see are too <unk> .
and we &apos;re looking at this in all walks of human life .
one of them , for example , in our current culture , in the united states today , is the struggle at first and in the end of life .
it &apos;s hard to fix a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the fetus .
there are very industrious discussions today that are present not in public , but in fact , when someone is called dead .
our ancestors never had to marry this question of whether someone was dead .
as a lot of them put a feather in front of his nose , and if he was still not chasing him .
if he stopped moving it .
but we can , for example , extract vital organs from one body and put them in another body .
and , as a consequence , we have to deal with the dilemma of actually tell someone &apos;s death , and it puts us in a difficult situation where we don &apos;t have the simple categories of the past .
and you might think that this supernova explosion could surprise someone like me .
in politics , i &apos;m progressive , people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit that it makes me nervous .
<unk> that these categories are much more qualitative than we thought i was tense .
closed from the point of view of democracy .
and to tell you about this tension first , i have to admit that i &apos;m a <unk> of the founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were big .
i mean , they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did , which i found every little bit of seeing that <unk> &quot; and not music , which is totally <unk> .
that &apos;s why it happened in <unk> with the founding fathers .
founding fathers were , for me , the first activists of anatomy , and i explain why .
what they suspected was a <unk> concept and matched it with another which was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years .
and , as you all remember , what <unk> our founding fathers was the idea of the monarchy , the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of the anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world did not know about dna , but they had clearly the idea of the right idea of birth .
they had the concept of blue blood .
they were the idea that the political power was hit by the right of blood passed from the grandfather and then the son and so on .
the founding fathers of that idea , and they started by a new concept of <unk> , and that was that all men are created the same .
they <unk> the playing field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the anatomy . that was very radical .
and partly they were doing it because they were part of a balanced system where two things were being destroyed .
democracy was <unk> and at the same time <unk> science .
and it &apos;s very clear , if you look at the history of founding fathers , who were very interested in science and the idea of a naturalist .
they were amazed at the supernatural explanation and therefore <unk> the concept of supernatural power of a vague idea of a blind idea of birth .
they were moving towards a naturalist .
and if you look , for example , the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as a result , they were passing the idea of the coincidence as they were .
and , by doing so , they were <unk> the basis of the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but they did it for us , and it was cool .
and what happened years later ?
it happened that women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the concept of the founding fathers of the coincidence was more important than the veiled difference , and they said , &quot; the fact that we have a womb and bar is not a significant enough difference to <unk> the right to the vote , the right to a full citizenship , and so on . &quot;
and the women were celebrated .
then , the success of the civil rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> , saying , &quot; isn &apos;t i a woman ? &quot;
we found men in the ranks of civil rights movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of color that <unk> the coincidence of <unk> and , again , <unk> .
we see the same thing with the <unk> movement .
the problem is , of course , as we look at coincidences , we have to start asking why we hold certain divided .
but , attention , i want to keep some similarities in our culture .
for example : i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t mean we should face the anatomy .
i don &apos;t mean that five @-@ year @-@ olds should be allowed to have sex or get married .
there are some divisions that are meaningful to me and that i think we should keep .
but the challenge is to try and figure out what they are , why keep them and if they make sense .
well , let &apos;s go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk .
we have two things , both of them , in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day .
imagine one of them , mary , was born three months before time : june 1st of 1980 &apos;s .
henry , on the contrary , was born in the term : march 3 , 1980 .
by the only fact that he was born three months before mary <unk> all rights three months before henry -- the right to sexual consent , the right to vote , the right to <unk> .
henry has to wait for all that not because he &apos;s a different kind of biological age , but he was born after .
we found other <unk> in terms of their rights .
henry , in virtue of being considered a man , if i haven &apos;t told you whether it &apos;s <unk> , by virtue of being a man , he is now <unk> by the <unk> that mary does not have to worry about .
mary , on his side , does not have the same rights to marriage that henry in all states , for example .
henry can get married in every state with a woman , but mary can get married with a woman just in some states .
so , there are still breeding categories that are involved in various ways that are both questionable and questionable .
and now the question is : what do we do now that science does so much work in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point that a democracy based on the anatomy could actually go ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , i sometimes feel like science gets us away .
where are we going ?
it seems that what happens in our culture is sort of a pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
but a lot of people are stuck in a weird position .
for example : texas at some point has decided that to marry a man , you don &apos;t have to have y chromosome and get married a woman .
now , in practice , they don &apos;t do human tests .
but this is also very strange , given the story that i told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome .
if you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , in his &quot; i @-@ <unk> &quot; offers a solution .
it says that we should judge people based on not the color of their skin , but the content of their character , &quot; going beyond the anatomy .
and i mean , &quot; yeah , the idea looks really good . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do people judge the content of their character ?
i want to also point out that i &apos;m not sure that we need to be involved in this to supply people &apos;s rights , because i have to admit that i know some of the clients who probably deserve more of the social services than some humans i know .
i also want to say that maybe some <unk> that i know can make more intelligent , intelligent , emotional decisions about their sex relationships than i know .
so , how do you put the subject of character content ?
it &apos;s very difficult .
and one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could in the future be measured by an instrument , maybe with an mri .
do we really want to get there ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i do know is it seems to be very important that the united states is still driving this kind of current thinking of democracy .
we &apos;ve done a good job in defense for democracy , and i think we &apos;re going to do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t live , for example , in a context like iranian where a man who is attracted to other men is susceptible to being murdered , unless he &apos;s willing to have a sex shift , in which case he can live .
we &apos;re not in that situation .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have a context like a surgeon who i spoke with a couple of years ago that i had done giving birth worms to then separate and <unk> their fame .
but when i was on the phone , i asked him the reason why the surgery was -- it was a very ugly operation -- he replied that in that other country , these kids would be very malnourished , and therefore he had to .
what i said , &quot; well , has you considered the political asylum rather than the surgical separation ? &quot;
america offers huge possibilities for people to be who are unable to change for the well of the state .
so i think we have to be in the head .
well , in closing , i mean i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the dads .
and i want to think about what democracy would look like , or how it might have been , if we &apos;d been more empowered to take care of .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , which is that i think there can be different ideas coming from different backgrounds , especially if there are people thinking about group .
for years , since i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also been interested in finding sexual difference .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world .
and what we know about <unk> studies is that women , on average , not all , but ultimately , tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> inside the group .
and if we think about that , we have an interesting situation in our hands .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my consultants who knew that i was interested in feminism -- i considered myself a feminist -- as <unk> , it made me a strange argument .
&quot; tell me what a woman has about feminism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; it &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism has got to do with getting rid of gender stereotypes , so there &apos;s nothing female about feminism . &quot;
but the more i &apos;ve thought about his question , the more i think there is something female in feminism .
i mean , there could be something , on average , something different between the female brain and the male brain that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable .
so , while the dads were very attentive , to finding a way to protect people from the state , it &apos;s possible that , if we had been more nurturing this concept , we would probably have <unk> the concept of protection with the reciprocal support .
and maybe that &apos;s what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond the anatomy : think less about the individual body , in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
so , while we &apos;re trying to create a more perfect union , let &apos;s think about what we do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my <unk> .
but before i show you what &apos;s inside , i &apos;m going to make a public confession , and that is , i &apos;m really obsessed with suits .
i love finding , dress , and more recently , photograph and publish in my blog suit , colorful and different for each time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
all my clothes is second hand from <unk> markets and second @-@ hand shops .
oh , thank you .
the second hand shops allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my wallet .
i get to know people <unk> ; usually my money goes to a good cause ; this looks unique ; and buying into my personal search for <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
do i love color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all answers are positive , then i feel like i &apos;ve won .
back to the theme of my <unk> , i want to tell you what i &apos;m going to say for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what &apos;s next to someone who has all that clothes ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
i &apos;ve brought seven pairs of underwear , and nothing else .
underwear for exactly one week is all i &apos;ve put in my <unk> .
i figured it would be able to find everything else i &apos;d like to use after i got here to palm springs .
and since they don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in underwear , that means i found some things .
and i &apos;d like to show you now the set for this week .
doesn &apos;t it sound interesting ?
while i do , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the lessons of life , believe it or not , have learned in this adventure of not using new clothing .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking good .
almost always , you can see great for less than 50 dollars .
the whole thing , including the jacket , cost me 55 , and it &apos;s the most expensive thing i &apos;ve ever used in the week .
monday : the color is energy .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be healthy , when you &apos;re wearing a bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to attract other happy people .
tuesday : integration is fixed .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk> .
i just know you .
if you get tired of the right people , you don &apos;t just understand you , you &apos;ll get stressed .
wednesday : get the kid inside .
sometimes people say to me , it sounds like i play a lot of the costumes , or i remember your little seven @-@ year @-@ old .
i like to tell you , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : trust is key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good at something , it &apos;s almost certain you &apos;re .
and if you think you don &apos;t see something well , it &apos;s probably true .
my mother taught me this day after day .
but it wasn &apos;t until the age of 30 that i really understood his meaning .
and i &apos;m going to explain it in a few seconds .
if you think you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and outside , there &apos;s no eyes you can &apos;t engage .
so there &apos;s no excuse to anyone in this audience .
we must be able to achieve everything we want to do .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth for you : the gold <unk> go with it .
and finally , saturday : developing a self @-@ and @-@ only personal form of telling the world something about you without having to say a word .
i &apos;ve tried it over and over again , when people came up to me this week , just for what i was using , and we had fantastic conversations .
obviously all this is not going to go into my little <unk> .
so before i go home , to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate everything .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that you have to quit certain things .
i don &apos;t need to physically sacrifice these things , because in the back of the corner , there will always be another rich , shiny suit , if there &apos;s a little bit of love in my heart and i &apos;m looking .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon everyone .
i have something to show you .
think it &apos;s a flying <unk> , a flying <unk> .
in our lab , we call it sensitive design .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about this .
if you look at this picture -- i &apos;m an italian origin , all the kids in italy grew up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom , but the reason i show this to you is that something very interesting has happened in the handled of one in the last two decades .
so , some time ago , if you wanted to win a career in formula 1 , you took a budget and you recommended it to a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , you would win the race .
but today , if you want to win a career , you need something like this -- something that <unk> the car in real time , with thousands of sensors that <unk> information and convey it to the system , and then use it to help the car and change things in real time as information is approved .
this is what , in engineering , takes real @-@ time control system .
it &apos;s essentially a system that has two components : a sensor and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is that real @-@ time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
our cities , over the last few years , have been covered with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re turning computers into the open air .
and , like that , they &apos;re starting to respond differently , and they can be copied and cured .
cities are big .
as a separate note , i wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s crust , but they represent 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and even 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
if we could do anything with cities , it would be a big thing .
beyond cities , all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects .
this is from an exhibition at <unk> for the late year at moma during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> to me . &quot;
well , our objects , our surroundings , begin to speak to us .
in a way , it &apos;s as though almost all of the existing atoms would become sensors and actuators .
and that &apos;s completely changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outside environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo .
you know , when michelangelo <unk> moses , it says , in the end he took the hammer , and he threw it down into moses -- you can still see a little baby in there and he says , &quot; <unk> , actually ? &quot;
well , today , for the first time , our environment begins to speak to us .
and i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples , insisting on the idea of engaging the environment and getting something done .
let &apos;s start with screening .
the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab .
this was four and a half years ago in italy .
what we did there was we used a new kind of network of that moment that had developed all over the world -- the <unk> phone network and <unk> information that was anonymous in that network that was somehow <unk> by the operator to understand how the city behaves .
it was a summer hopefully 2006 .
it was the year in italy he won the world cup .
maybe some of you remember him , he plays in italy and france , and at the end of the day , he gave the <unk> .
and anyway , he eventually won italy .
now let &apos;s look at what happened that day , looking at cross @-@ border activity .
here we see the city .
you see the coliseum in the middle and the river <unk> .
it &apos;s morning , before play .
the time line is at the top .
in the early evening , there are people over here and there doing calls , moving .
the game begins : silence .
<unk> from france . <unk> from italy .
<unk> -- people do a quick call and go to the bathroom .
second time . end of time .
one more time . second .
<unk> , and at a moment , <unk> .
he wins italy , yes !
that night , everyone went to the center .
there you see the big spike .
the next day , everyone was at the center of the winning team and the prime minister of that day .
and then the whole world went down .
you see the picture of the place called massimo circus , where , of the roman time , people will celebrate , it &apos;s a great party , you can see the peak at the end of the day .
this is just an example of how we can today measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do just a few years ago .
another quick example of detection : it &apos;s not about people , it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
today , we know everything about the characteristics of our objects .
this is a map that shows all the chips that make a mac , how you assemble it .
but we know very little about where things are going .
so in this project , we developed some small labels to track the trash in its <unk> .
we started with a few volunteers who helped us in seattle a little over a year ago , to label what they were throwing -- different kinds of things , as you can see , things that were anyway .
then we put a little chip on , a tag , on the trash , and then we started <unk> .
these are the results from that .
from seattle .
after a week .
with this information , we realize that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same thing with a lot less energy .
this is data that didn &apos;t exist before .
they &apos;re happening complicated things , and there &apos;s a lot of unnecessary transportation .
but the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup doesn &apos;t go away , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
that if the plastic bottle we throw in a day , it &apos;s still there .
that if we show that to people , then we can promote some behavior change .
that was the reason for the project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could tell us a lot more about detection , and a lot of cool things we can do with that , but i wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning , which is to push it over the environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago at <unk> .
it all began with a question of the mayor of the city , which came to us and said that spain and the south europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces , in architecture .
and the question was : how can technology , the new technology , add it to that ?
and one of the ideas that we developed at mit , in a workshop , was : imagine they have a <unk> and valves , valves , valves , and they open up .
it creates like a curtain of water , with water pixels .
if the pixels can be written in them , show patterns , images , text .
and as you zoom in , the curtain will open so that we can pass , as you can see in the image .
we introduced this to <unk> mayor .
he liked it so much .
and we set up a commission to design the building at the entrance to the <unk> .
we call it the digital highway .
the whole building is made of water .
there &apos;s no doors and no windows , but when you approach it , it opens up so you can pass .
the roof is also covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a little bit of wind , if you want to minimize the <unk> , the roof goes down .
or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears in this case .
those days will always be someone , in the winter , when the ceiling comes down , someone who was there and said , &quot; <unk> the building . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not that they have ignored it , but when architecture comes down to almost all the architecture goes away .
here it is working .
you see people going through what &apos;s going on inside .
and here i am myself trying not to get wet by testing the sensors that open the water .
i think i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
that night was really even more fun .
all the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way they interact had changed a little bit .
it was no longer a building that would open to leave you , but a building that was still keeping slices and tons of water and you had to jump out and not contaminate it .
and for us that , it was very interesting because as architects , engineers , designers , we always think about the use that people will give our designs .
but then reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things to interact with , that people use .
this is a picture of the building with the physical pixels , the pixels of water , and of projection about them .
and this is what led us to think about the next project i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that those pixels could start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter in the air , and each of you had a little <unk> that changes color as if it was a cloud that &apos;s moving in space .
this is the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one we saw before , moving with others in sync .
we could form this cloud .
sort of like a flexible screen like this with a normal two @-@ dimensional configuration .
or normal , but in three dimensions , where what changes is light , not the position of the pixels .
you can play a different kind of guy .
imagine that the display appears at different scales and sizes , different kinds of resolution .
and then all of that could go on a side @-@ by @-@ 3d cloud that you could get near and go through , and see from very different angles .
this is the real controlled <unk> , going down to form a v , like before .
when the light goes on , it looks like this . the same thing we saw before .
imagine each of them being controlled by a person .
we can have every <unk> that comes from people , the movement of people , etc . , etc .
i want to show you something for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers today , the new york <unk> <unk> star and la <unk> to capture their movements in 3d and use them as inputs to the <unk> .
here we can see <unk> dancing .
on the left , you see the pixels , it captures in different <unk> .
it &apos;s so much real @-@ time 3d as motion capture .
it can wash all the movement .
you can walk all the way around .
and once we have the pixels , we can play with them , with color and motion , with gravity and rotation .
we want to use this as a possible entry into the <unk> .
i wanted to show you the last project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something for the london olympics .
it &apos;s called &quot; cloud . &quot;
and the idea is , imagine again , that we could engage people in order to do something and change our landscape environment as a barn @-@ raising , but with a cloud .
imagine that we could make everyone flow a little bit for a living .
and i think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that , in the last two decades , we go from the physical world to the digital world .
we &apos;ve digitized everything , as knowledge , and is accessible throughout the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world , the self @-@ organized power of networks , the physical world .
in our case , we might want to use it to design and make a symbol .
that would mean something built in a city .
but tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today : think of climate change or co2 emissions . how do we move from the digital world to the physical world ?
the idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made out of the same way the actual cloud is a cloud of particles .
and those particles are water , while in our cloud , they are pixels .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it &apos;s covered with pixels .
you can move inside , have different experiences .
you can see from the bottom , serve to share the main moments of the 2012 olympics and even more , and you can use it as a way of connection to the community .
so , it &apos;s both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can climb up , like a new top of london .
you can get in there .
as if he was a new digital <unk> at night , but the most important thing is it &apos;s going to be a new experience for anyone to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the connection is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express humans not separate from nature and everything is interconnected .
i was for the first time to antarctica about 10 years ago , and i saw my first <unk> .
i was amazed .
my heart pounding , i was <unk> , trying to understand what was in front of me .
i <unk> them around me almost 60 meters of water , and i couldn &apos;t think it was a snowflake as a <unk> of snow about another snowflake as a year after year .
the rainy ones are born when they fall off the glaciers or cut down the ice walls .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end , while others can &apos;t get more and more fun in a dramatic passion .
it &apos;s easy to think , when we see an iceberg , that they &apos;re isolated and alone , largely as we see ourselves as humans .
but reality is the opposite .
as an iceberg melts , i &apos;m breathing your ancient atmosphere .
as an iceberg melts , it releases rich freshwater into minerals that it feeds many forms of life .
i &apos;m close to photograph these <unk> as if it comes to portraits of my ancestors , knowing that at these unique moments there is that way and will never exist again .
it &apos;s not death when it &apos;s gone ; it &apos;s not an end , but a course of its way through the life cycle .
part of the melting ice that <unk> is very young -- has a couple of thousands of years .
and another part of the ice has over 100,000 years .
the last photos i &apos;d like to show you are from an iceberg that i photographed in <unk> , greenland .
it &apos;s kind of frequent to actually witness a rolling iceberg .
here you go .
you can see on the left a little boat .
it &apos;s about five meters long .
and i would like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its <unk> line .
you can see here , it starts rolling , the ship has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is an iceberg in greenland , average size .
it stands for about 120 feet or 40 feet .
this video is in real time .
and so <unk> , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
clearly , i &apos;ve been <unk> in life with many amazing projects .
but the cool one i worked on was for this guy .
the guy is called <unk> .
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the &apos; 80s .
one day he came to his house after running and said , &quot; dad , i feel a <unk> on my legs . &quot;
and that was the start of als .
today <unk> has a complete paralysis .
it can only use your eyes .
their work influenced me .
i have a design and animation company , so obviously , graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world .
so we decided that we were going to link to tony , <unk> , and his cause .
so i went and met with her brother and father and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give them this money .
what are they going to do with him ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and he &apos;s able to communicate with me . &quot;
and i said , &quot; a second , it &apos;s not that you &apos;ve seen stephen <unk> , is it not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re an important person and you have a very good insurance , you can &apos;t actually do it .
these devices are not affordable for people . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate then ? &quot;
anyone see the movie &quot; the <unk> and the butterfly ? &quot;
they communicate that way -- they &apos;re <unk> with their finger .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s wei . how can that be ? &quot;
so i set up with the only wish to give a check , and instead i signed a check i didn &apos;t have the least idea of how i was going to cover .
i &apos;m going to sit with his brother and his father right now , &quot; ok , this is the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to build a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s ridiculous that someone who has so much inside can &apos;t get it . &quot;
so i spoke at a conference a couple of months later .
i met these guys called <unk> music research , which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then , with a laser pointer , they draw on that and register the negative space .
so they &apos;re going around doing art installations like this .
all the things that come up , they say , they &apos;re part of a life cycle .
they first start with sexual organs , then with bad words , then with bush attacks and , at the end , people start doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so , i went home , and as i was dealing with my wife , i would tell him about this , and we said , &quot; if we know that the technology that allows us to use the eyes to control things why we don &apos;t think a way we could control a laser to do graffiti again . it would be great . &quot;
and so the journey began .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things moving from side to side , we had achieved a couple of things .
one , we touch the doors of insurance companies , and we got a machine so that we could communicate , a machine like stephen hawking &apos;s <unk> .
which was great .
and seriously , it &apos;s all fun , and i call it <unk> , because when you talk to the guy , you get an e @-@ mail from him , and you say , &quot; i don &apos;t deserve it . this guy is fantastic . &quot;
the other thing we did was we brought seven programmers from all over the world out of every corner of our house .
my wife , kids and i , we moved to the garage of behind and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> , and they took over the house .
a lot of our friends thought we &apos;d do something completely stupid , and when <unk> would have taken away the frames of the walls and instead there would be graffiti .
but for two weeks , we went to the <unk> ride , my son was part , my dog was also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
it &apos;s a pair of cheap sunglasses that we bought at the <unk> beach ride , some copper wire and stuff at home .
we took a <unk> camera , we cut it , we put it on an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- and it &apos;s built the software , we post the software that goes down for free .
and we create a device that has no limitation at all .
there &apos;s no insurance company to say , &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicating using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much . that was amazing .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
i love this picture because this is the other person &apos;s room , and that &apos;s her room .
there was all this big <unk> and <unk> during the big opening .
and then over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , intense sessions all night , tony went back and forth for the first time in seven years .
and this is a wonderful picture because this is the life support system , and it &apos;s looking through the life support system .
we stimulated her bed so she could see .
and we put a projector on a wall of the car park outside the hospital .
and he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking .
the funny thing was , we had to ride in a parking lot , so we feel like we were having graffiti @-@ waving graffiti too .
at the end of this he gave us an e @-@ mail , and this is what he said to us , &quot; this is the first time he was drawing in seven years .
i felt like i had been underwater , and someone finally came to me and was glad to get married . &quot;
isn &apos;t that wonderful ?
in a way , that &apos;s our scream at war .
that &apos;s what keeps us moving , developing .
and we have a long way to go through this .
it &apos;s a cool device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of a <unk> display .
someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and robust .
since then , we &apos;ve had all sorts of recognition .
we &apos;ve won a lot of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making money out of this .
everything comes out of our own pockets .
the prizes were just like , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> something about us , and then , december , time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , and it was really great .
the best of all of this -- and this is what ends up closing -- is that in april this year at the <unk> of <unk> in downtown los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; art in the streets . &quot;
&quot; art on the streets &quot; is going to have the best urban <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re all going to be there .
<unk> is going to be in the show , which is pretty impressive .
so , this is basically my idea : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
none of what &apos;s in this room was possible -- the stage , the computer , the microphone , the microphone -- nothing was possible at some point .
make it possible -- anything in this room .
i &apos;m not a programmer , i never did anything with eye recognition technology ; i just recognized something and marvel at wonderful people so that i can make it happen .
and these are the questions that i want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like we have to do . if it &apos;s not now , when ? and if i &apos;m not me , who ?
thank you guys .
you know what i do is i write for kids , and , in fact , i &apos;m probably the author for kids , most read in america .
and i always tell people i don &apos;t want to look like a scientist .
i can claim it as a farmer , or with leather clothes , and no one has ever chosen a farmer .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and <unk> .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something that you fell somewhere .
you just have to turn the apple around and see it as an epiphany .
that &apos;s a picture of a circle .
a friend of mine did that -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of tricky circle i &apos;m going to talk to you .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s in the middle school , in <unk> , ohio where i was the freak of the class .
as i was beaten up to bleed every week in the kids &apos; toilets , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life in the <unk> of the teacher &apos;s room .
he made it secret .
for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a thumb , and 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- i found a lover -- and in the &apos; 80s , i felt the need to start working on organizations that were fighting aids .
about three or four years ago , in the middle of the night , i got a phone call from that masterpiece , the <unk> lady who said , &quot; i need to see you .
i &apos;m glad adults we never get to know .
you could call it ohio , and please bring that man that i know you &apos;ve already found .
and i have to tell you , i have pancreatic cancer , and i would like you to engage with this for please . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we went to see it , we laugh , we cry , and we realized that she needed to be abused .
we found a place , we <unk> it , and we looked at it and we charge it for her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to wake him up as a grown @-@ up , she became a dead box and was put in my hands .
and what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that i talked about was made in itself .
epiphany is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , my partner and i save her from her .
and you know that part of life needs everything the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m very happy that today talked a lot about this .
it also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our work to provide those things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion when you &apos;re at 900 feet tall .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor doing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it sounds scary .
well , i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in the <unk> .
it was the only one that could talk to the flying assistants .
so i immediately looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem . you probably see some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already cracked the plane , and we weren &apos;t so far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the aircraft <unk> the plane with the hudson river .
usually that &apos;s not the route .
it will accelerate the motors .
imagine being on a plane and without noise .
and then he said three words -- the three most <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he said , &quot; <unk> for impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more about the flying assistant .
i could see him in his eyes , it was terror . life is over .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about myself that day .
i learned that everything changes in a minute .
we have this list of things to do before we die , these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to get , and i didn &apos;t , all the fences , all the experiences that i &apos;ve wanted to have and never had .
as i was thinking about that later , i was a phrase , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m going to open it up .
i don &apos;t want to spend anything in life .
and that urgency , that purpose , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is when i hit the bridge george washington , which was not for a lot -- i thought about , wow , i really feel a big deal .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
in my humanity and my mistakes , i have tried to improve everything i did .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego a place .
and i &apos;m sorry about the time that i &apos;m focused on things that i didn &apos;t care about .
and i thought about my relationship to my wife , with my friends , with the people .
and then , as i looked at that , i &apos;d remove the negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
in two years , i haven &apos;t had a fight with my wife .
it feels like wonders .
i &apos;m not trying to be right anymore ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is like your mental clock is ticking , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you see the water coming .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please fly . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this to break down into 20 pieces like you see in those documentaries .
and as i wandered around , i had a sense of , wow , death doesn &apos;t fear .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been working for it all of our life .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness in a single thought , which is , i just wish one thing .
i wish i could see my kids grow up .
a month later , i was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade , not so much artistic talent .
... still .
and i shout , yell , like a little one .
and for me , that was the whole reason for me .
at that point , i understood by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent .
above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good parent .
i was given a miracle , not dying that day .
and i was given another gift , which was the possibility of looking into the future and coming back and living differently .
you &apos;re flying today , the challenge you can imagine that the same thing is happening on your plane -- and please not be -- but imagine , how would it change ?
what would you do , which you still expect to do , because you think you &apos;re going to live forever ?
how would it change their relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and most importantly , are the best parents who can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the loose computer worm is actually very simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the nuclear bomb .
their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the uranium <unk> plant .
the gray boxes you see are real @-@ time control systems .
if we can engage these systems that control speeds and valves , we can cause a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
the gray boxes don &apos;t use windows software ; they &apos;re from a completely different technology .
but if we can put a windows @-@ selling virus on a laptop computer that &apos;s used by an engineer to set up this gray box , then we &apos;re ready .
this is the behind <unk> .
we started with a windows <unk> .
the <unk> enters the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the iranian program is <unk> ; it &apos;s <unk> mission .
it &apos;s easy , huh ?
i want to tell you how we discovered this .
when we started doing research on <unk> six months ago , the purpose was completely unknown .
the only thing that was known is that it &apos;s very , very complex at the windows part : the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities of the day @-@ to @-@ zero .
it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these control systems .
that really caught our attention , and we started an experiment where we filled our surroundings with <unk> , and we saw what was going on with this .
so , very strange things happened .
<unk> dressed like a laboratory rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese : it sounded , but i didn &apos;t want to eat .
it didn &apos;t make sense for me .
and after experiencing different flavors of cheese , i realized , and i thought , &quot; this is an attack .
it &apos;s completely run . &quot;
the <unk> is seeking actively in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration , and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that location .
if not , <unk> does nothing .
so that called my attention , and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day , because i thought , &quot; we don &apos;t know what the goal is . &quot;
it could be , say , for example , a u.s. energy plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
better than the goal .
so we pulled out and pulled out the attack code , and we found that it was structured in two digital bombs : a small one and a big one .
we also saw that they were very professionally armed by people who obviously had all the information inside .
they knew all the points for attacking .
you probably even know how much the operator is .
so , you know everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that <unk> &apos;s is complex and high @-@ tech , let me tell you , the payload is very complex .
it &apos;s very much above all we &apos;ve seen before .
here you see a sample of this attack code .
we &apos;re talking about over 15,000 lines in code .
it looks pretty much like the old <unk> language .
i want to tell you how we could find this code .
what we were looking at at at the beginning was called the functions of the system , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and trying to match the real world with potential goals in the real world .
we need theories about them that we can pass or pass .
to get to theories about goals , we remember that it &apos;s definitely a violent <unk> , it must be a valuable white , and it &apos;s surely located in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections has been <unk> .
there are not many thousands of goals in that area .
it basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and <unk> plant of <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; get a list of all the experts in america and power plants between our clients . &quot;
i called them up , and i told them in an effort to interpret their experience with what we found in code and data .
and it worked pretty well .
so we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of rotor .
rotor is that cell piece inside the centrifuge , that black object you see .
if you hold the speed of this rotating , you can actually recognize it and even make it <unk> .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and to flow in an obvious effort to go crazy to the nest engineers , so that they couldn &apos;t quite solve this quickly .
we &apos;re trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at data and structure .
so , for instance , the number <unk> out in that code , you can &apos;t get it .
i started doing science literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and i found that they are <unk> in what a waterfall is called , and every waterfall is <unk> .
that made sense , there was a coincidence .
and he got better yet .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that was a good coincidence .
this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands .
so , there was no misunderstanding , it wasn &apos;t .
the results have been there after several weeks of hard work .
we usually stand out in the <unk> , and we had to start again .
yet , we discovered that both digital <unk> will contribute to one single , same goal , but from different angles .
the little barbs on it is taking a waterfall and turning these rotors and spins them , and the <unk> big communicate with six <unk> and valves .
in sum , we &apos;re very confident that we have determined what the recipient is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
we don &apos;t have to worry about other goals being driven by <unk> .
so here i show you some very interesting things that we saw , i &apos;m really ashamed of .
there &apos;s the gray box , and the top is called the <unk> .
so , what this thing does is it protects the input from the sensors , for example , from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and legal code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
and believe it or not , these fake input data is <unk> by <unk> .
it &apos;s like in the hollywood movies where , during the theft , the security camera is actually feeding video .
that &apos;s cool , huh ?
the idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the room .
it &apos;s really much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to <unk> a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human operator couldn &apos;t act fast .
for example , in a power plant , when the big steam engine comes off , you have to open the escape tubes in a millisecond .
obviously , this can &apos;t do a human operator .
that &apos;s where we need digital security systems .
and when they &apos;re engaged , they can do bad things .
the plant can burst .
and you don &apos;t notice the security system .
that scares it .
but it can be worse .
what i &apos;m going to say is very important .
think about this . this attack is generic .
it has nothing to do with it , specifically , with uranium <unk> .
it could also work , for example , in a power plant , or in a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to disseminate this burden with a usb key , as we saw in the case of <unk> .
you could also use conventional worms technology for <unk> .
let &apos;s zoom in as possible .
and if you do that , what you find is , with a <unk> of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to deal with .
unfortunately , the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states and japan .
all the green areas are very large spaces of great goals .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start preparing us now .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s taken public on many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this .
what &apos;s your opinion ?
ralph <unk> : okay , do you really want to hear this ?
okay . okay .
my guess is that <unk> is involved , but the engine is not israel .
the engine behind this is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s one , and that &apos;s the united states , fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problems would be even bigger .
thank you for inviting me . thank you , ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years researching into situations generally very difficult and at the same time a little bit dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
it was filmed in conflict zones -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating only this -- fun at first , which is difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance with the only purpose of <unk> to examine social issues in ways that <unk> attractive , interesting things , and hopefully measuring them in a way that will be seen and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to do a tedtalk on the world of brands and patronage , i wanted to do something a little different .
so , some of you may have heard it , or not , a couple of weeks ago , i took a ride on ebay .
i sent some messages to facebook , some in twitter , i offered to sell the rights of my tedtalk in 2011 .
so , some fortunate , a corporation , a nonprofit , was going to have the only chance in life , telling chris anderson not going to allow him to be able to buy the rights of the talk that you &apos;re looking at right now that i didn &apos;t have a lot of content , and it didn &apos;t really explain what it would be .
so , what was next : &quot; here , <unk> name shows : my tedtalk that you have no idea what it &apos;s all about and content could be buried in the face , especially if i put it ridiculous to you or your company to do it .
but that is a very good media opportunity . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
it &apos;s a title of progress , by the way .
so even with that ferment knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name .
if you had asked me a year ago , i would not have been able to make sure .
but in the new film i &apos;m working on , looking at the world of marketing , of advertising .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;ve been in horrible situations in the last few years , but nothing could make me ready , so hard or as dangerous as stepping into the halls with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
i want to make a film that is about the <unk> of products , marketing and advertising , and the whole film is all about products and marketing and advertising .
the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what &apos;s happening in &quot; the larger movie &quot; is that everything from the top down , in principle , has <unk> images , all the time -- from the <unk> that appears before the title , the x @-@ ray .
now this brand , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center .
these people <unk> the film to <unk> -- forever .
and so , the film explores all this idea . is it what ? is it a <unk> , forever ?
i &apos;m a storyteller .
it was more motivational .
it was &quot; a <unk> . forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the x @-@ files , brand at the title , but we &apos;re going to make sure we all have the categories that we can in the film .
maybe you &apos;ll get a shoe , and you get the most cool shoe you &apos;ve used ...
the most cool car you &apos;ve ever offered in &quot; the <unk> film , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever offered . &quot;
the idea is then to show the marks as part of the life , to make them clarify the film .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole process in this movie .
that &apos;s the whole idea , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love you to help make it happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny because it &apos;s the first time i hear that ; it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
but i don &apos;t know how traumatized it &apos;s going to be the people who are .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t know if &quot; an angle &quot; is too stubborn , but you know how it &apos;s going to crash ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
a million and a half .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to get the meeting with them , but it &apos;s definitely going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands .
who knows , maybe by the time the movie comes out , let &apos;s see us as a whole bunch of prescription idiots .
what do you think is going to be the answer ?
most of the answers will be &quot; no . &quot;
but will it be hard to sell , by the film or for me ?
jk : both .
it means you &apos;re not very optimistic .
so , do you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
all right .
impressive .
we have to think about what brands are .
yes .
when you look at the people you have to deal with .
we have some places to go .
turn off the camera .
i thought , &quot; <unk> the camera , &quot; meant we have a conversation outside our mic .
turn off the camera means , &quot; we don &apos;t want to know anything about your movie . &quot;
and so it was , one by one , all these companies suddenly disappeared .
none wanted to have anything to do with this movie .
i was shocked .
they didn &apos;t want to know anything about this .
and i was very impressed , i thought the concept of advertising , was to give the product to as many people as possible , to make sure as many people watched it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this intersection of new media and old media and the media landscape , is it not the idea to have that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the masses ?
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had a <unk> error , and that error was this .
actually , no , there was no mistake .
there was no mistake at all .
this would have been fine .
but the problem was what this image represents .
see , when you look for images of transparency in google , it appears -- this is one of the first images that come up .
i like your way to roll , sergey brin . no .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of simulation , or deception -- easily detected or seen , easily understandable -- that &apos;s characterized by visibility or <unk> of information , especially in business practices -- being the last line maybe the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency in these days .
our politicians name it , the ceo , name it , even the ceos name it .
but all of a sudden when it comes to making it really , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is afraid -- like that weird bear still remains .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this weird road .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what &apos;s another thing that &apos;s risky ?
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s very risky .
when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to believe me . &quot;
we want them to be a story , but we want them to read our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father would lie to me on a lie -- and there he is , looking at me , saying , &quot; son , there are three sides in every story .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
you see , in this film , we wanted to tell the actual story .
but with only one company , an agency wants to help me -- and that only because i knew john bond and richard <unk> -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i would have to get out of the middle @-@ class and go to the companies myself with my team .
so , what i started to point out all of a sudden -- and what i started to give me is that when you start talking to corporations , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends who make large films , huge , giant films and other people who make small films , independent films like mine .
and my friends who make large hollywood movies , giant hollywood tell them that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the associated brands that they have .
and then my friends making independent films say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant movies in hollywood ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
how are we going to see specifically ban ban on the film ?
every time i &apos;m about to go out , every time i open my <unk> , you &apos;ll see the ban .
at any time during an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you good at this interview ?
are you ready ? you get a little nervous .
i want to help you out .
maybe you should get a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
and there he was one of these fabulous <unk> .
so much &quot; floral fusion &quot; as &quot; <unk> of paradise &quot; is going to have its opportunity .
we &apos;re going to have as much for men as a woman , solid , <unk> , onstage , whatever .
that &apos;s the general look .
now i can answer your questions and give you a glimpse .
we &apos;re a small brand .
similar to the kind of smaller movies that we predicted ; we &apos;re much more good drives .
so we don &apos;t have the budget that has other marks .
so , to do things like that , you know , to remind people of it is the reason we &apos;re interested in it .
what words would they use to describe ban ban ?
ban is on white .
that &apos;s a big question .
high tech .
technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put into the <unk> .
we talk about something bold , fresh .
i think &quot; cool &quot; is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus &quot; the smell and sweat . &quot;
it keeps you warm .
how do we keep you fresh ? with more freshness , more freshness , three times cooler .
things like that would make the benefits .
and that &apos;s a <unk> company .
what about me ? what about a common guy ?
i need to talk to the man on the street , to the people like me , to the common <unk> .
they have to talk to me about my brand .
how do you define your brand ?
hmm .
i don &apos;t know .
i like good clothes .
woman : she reaches &apos; 80s , &apos; <unk> &apos; unless she &apos;s too late .
okay , so what &apos;s the <unk> brand ?
something unique .
i guess the kind of gender , the style i have would be like a dark glamour .
i like dark colors , lots of gray and things like that .
normally , i wear accessories like sunglasses , or i like crystals and pieces .
if dan was a brand , he could be a classic <unk> , mercedes benz .
the brand i am , i would call it casual flight .
woman # 2 : in a part of a hippie , in part of &apos; girl brooklyn , i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the type of pets .
i sell pet toys in the country and in the world .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my little sector , that &apos;s my brand .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because he <unk> the <unk> .
man 7 : a born @-@ <unk> writer .
is that something ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a firm lawyer .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be tom , but i often get distracted at the intersection of dark glamour and <unk> .
i realized i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could come into my head , someone who could help me understand what they call the &quot; <unk> personality . &quot;
and i found a company called pittsburgh <unk> .
they helped companies like pfizer , <unk> , <unk> , to discover that brand personality .
if they could do it for them , they could surely do it for me .
just shoot the photos , right ?
yes . the first picture is a familiar photo .
tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings , your way to being .
these guys shape my way of looking at the world .
tell me about that world .
that world ? i think your world is the world you live in -- like the people around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the work you do .
all of these things come out and start in a place , and in my case , they come in and start in my family , in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about ?
the next is &quot; this is the best day of my life . &quot;
how does this relate to your thoughts , feelings and your way to be ?
it &apos;s like who wants to be me .
i like different things .
i like weird stuff . i like weird stuff .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; -- what &apos;s good for us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what &apos;s the <unk> phase you find now ?
why is it important to <unk> ? what &apos;s red ?
tell me a little bit about that .
a little bit more about you , which is not who you are .
what other guesses ?
it doesn &apos;t have to fear . what kind of rollercoaster you are ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of this .
there was a lot of crazy about this .
the first thing i saw was this idea that there are two different sides , but margins , in your brand personality , morgan <unk> , is a very conscious <unk> .
they dressed themselves very well together .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox in them .
and i think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points , or the other , instead of focusing on both .
many companies tend to -- and it &apos;s nature -- to avoid the things that are not safe -- keep fear , those elements , and you actually give them to sink and make them become positive for you , and it &apos;s nice to see that .
what other brands are like this ?
the first here is the classic , apple .
and you can also see here at <unk> , wii , mini , which is really packaged .
now , there are cognitive brands and brands , those things that have gone and come , but a playful conscious brand is quite powerful .
a playful act . what &apos;s your brand ?
if someone asks you to understand your brand identity , your brand personality , what would it be ?
are you a ascending asset ? are you somebody who makes blood flow ?
or are you a lower asset ?
a little bit quieter , <unk> ?
the ascending attributes are like being playful , like &quot; the prince , contemporary , <unk> , <unk> , fearless or bold as <unk> , fast or stressed , dominant , brutal or mystic as <unk> . &quot;
or are you more top @-@ down ?
are you conscious , sophisticated as <unk> ?
are you set , traditional provider , protector ? you &apos;re all distracted by oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , familiar , reliable , confident , sacred , bisexual or wise , like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of this movie , we had over 500 companies , climbing and <unk> , saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want to be part of this project .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film , mainly because they wouldn &apos;t have control , they wouldn &apos;t have control over the end product .
but we got 17 marketing partners who were willing to give up that control they wanted to be in the business with someone who is conscious and playful like me and that , ultimately , we were empowered to tell stories that we would not normally have been able to tell -- stories after a <unk> would usually never go .
we were allowed to tell the story of <unk> , and we were able to tell the story in this movie of how they now use mri to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing .
we went to sao paulo where they have banned advertising to open air .
throughout the city over the last five years , there are no fences , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no <unk> , there &apos;s nothing .
and we went to school districts where businesses are on their way through schools with u.s. money supply problems .
the amazing thing for me is that the projects that i &apos;ve had the biggest answer , or where i &apos;ve been most successful are the ones i &apos;ve been focusing on .
and that &apos;s what these marks did .
they took their <unk> , they took their agencies , and they said maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to try directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to make people think , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world .
and how have you gone ? do you succeed ?
well , ever since the movie was released in the <unk> festival , let &apos;s take a look .
as the movie came out in january , and since then -- and this is not <unk> -- we &apos;ve had 900 million impressions in the media for this film .
this just takes a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ week period .
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no tv .
the movie is still not disturbed .
it &apos;s not yet online . it &apos;s not <unk> .
they haven &apos;t even presented in other countries yet .
ultimately , this film has already begun to gain momentum .
and it &apos;s not bad because almost all of the agencies that we &apos;re talking to her clients aren &apos;t being part .
i &apos;ve always believed that if you risk , if you take risks , that in those risks there are opportunities .
i think when you get people out of that , you &apos;re pushing them into failure .
i think when you train your employees at risk aversion , you &apos;re preparing their whole company to reward them for reward them .
i feel that what &apos;s happening to move forward is that we have to encourage people to take risks .
we have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to bring fear to it .
we have to put that bear in a cage .
we &apos;re afraid . we &apos;re timing for risk .
from a <unk> at a time , we have to embrace risk .
and ultimately , we have to get transparency .
more than just a little bit of honesty , it &apos;s going to go a long way .
and by saying this , with honesty and transparency , all my talk &quot; <unk> the <unk> &quot; has been submitted by my good friends of <unk> who for dollars sold the rights of the name on ebay .
making big data into big opportunities for companies around the world .
<unk> shows &quot; <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
thank you very much people .
so , morgan , in the name of transparency , exactly what happened with those dollars growing ?
it &apos;s a fantastic question .
in my pocket , i have a check to be asked by the ted matrix , which is the mtn foundation , which is a check for dollars to be applied to my assistance for ted next year .
my name is <unk> .
and 18 months ago , i was doing another job on google , until i launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss , which is here and allowed me to do it .
it took me 18 months and it took me 18 months .
many negotiations and stories , i assure you , with 17 very interesting museums for nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did it .
i think my own story just explains this slide , and this is the access .
i grew up in india .
joy of great education -- i didn &apos;t get tired , but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and artwork .
so , when i started traveling and going to museums , i started learning a lot .
and working on google , i try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing so .
better than the demo i &apos;ll show you a couple of interesting things that we &apos;ve done since the launch .
so , just , we &apos;re just going to start <unk> .
look around all the museums there .
there &apos;s professor tobias , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i &apos;m actually going to go in one of my favorites , to the <unk> , the new york art museum .
there are two ways of doing that -- very simple .
we click , we click , we click ! we &apos;re into the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are , mumbai or <unk> , that doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around and you have fun .
do you want to browse to the museum ?
we open the plan up , and with one click , we jump in .
they &apos;re inside , you want to go to the end of the hall .
keep on going . what &apos;s wrong !
explore .
thank you , but i haven &apos;t reached the best .
now , i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; from pieter <unk> .
i see the management sign .
if the museum shows us the picture , we click there .
look , this is one of the images .
here &apos;s all the metadata data .
for those of you who are really interested in art , you can click there , but i &apos;m going to click right now .
and this is one of the images that we &apos;ve captured in what we call <unk> technology .
so this picture , for example , contains , i think , about 10,000 million pixels .
and there are many people who ask me , &quot; and what do you get from 10,000 million hits ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you what you actually get from 10,000 million hits .
zoom in on a very simple way .
you see fun things that are happening .
i love this guy , his expression has no price .
but if i really wanted to go into it .
so i started playing , and i found something that was happening there .
and i said , &quot; wait a minute , this looks interesting . &quot;
i went in and discovered that kids were actually playing something .
i did a little research , i talked to some people from the <unk> , and i actually found that this is a game called &#91; unclear &#93; , which is about hitting a stick with a pole on the left behind .
and it seems very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i &apos;ve learned something about it .
and now we &apos;re going to get further down and you &apos;ll see that you can actually even get to the cracks .
now just to give you a little bit of perspective , i &apos;m going to take the picture away , so you &apos;ll really see what &apos;s there .
this is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is to come , a second .
so now we &apos;re going fast to jump again to moma in new york .
here &apos;s another one of my favorites , &quot; the night <unk> . &quot;
the example i showed was to find some details .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
it increases and actually it .
i &apos;m going to one of my favorite parts in this picture , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
this is &quot; <unk> night , &quot; i think i &apos;ve never seen it before .
i &apos;m going to show you another one of my favorite features .
there &apos;s a lot more stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time to go .
this is the really cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
all of you , absolutely everyone , doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich or poor , or if you have a mansion , that just does .
you can online create your own museum , create your own collection from all these pictures .
it &apos;s very simple ; we come in -- i &apos;ve created this function that i call the power of zooming , &quot; -- we &apos;ve just sort of zoom in .
this is &quot; the ambassadors &quot; in the national gallery in london .
you can score things , you can write it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you contemplate these masterpieces .
so , in conclusion , i think for me , the main thing is that all amazing things don &apos;t really come from google .
no , in my opinion , they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
actually , they come from those artists .
and that &apos;s been my very humble experience with this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium , it makes justice for its artwork and it &apos;s properly represented online .
and the big question i get asked today is , &quot; have you done this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it is for supplement the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts .
the left side , which is the logical part , and the right side , which is the intuitive part .
so , if we scale up a scale to measure the fitness of each hemisphere , we could design a plan of our brain .
for example , this would be someone who is completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s totally intuitive .
so , where do you measure your brain on this scale ?
some people spit through one of these extreme ends , but i think for most of the members of this audience , their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> of <unk> at the same time .
it &apos;s not that they are mutually exclusive .
you can be intuitive , intuitive .
i consider one of those people , which is just the same as most other experimental physicists , experimental physicists , we need quite a bit of logic for these complicated ideas .
but at the same time , we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we like to play things .
we start playing with them , and then we see how they react , and then we develop our intuition from that point .
and actually , you do the same thing .
some intuition that you might have developed over the years is what it says one thing can only be in a place at a time .
i mean , it may sound odd to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , they developed it .
i remember watching a kid playing in a parking lot .
he was a little kid , and he didn &apos;t do it very well , he always fell .
but i bet the game with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson , and that is that big stuff doesn &apos;t allow the <unk> to stay in a place .
this is a big conceptual model that you can have from the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with parking bars , they play with these strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , they discover that they do all sorts of really strange things -- like they can go through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called it quantum mechanics theory .
at that point , physics was found a few years ago ; you had the quantum mechanics to describe these little particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the big objects around us every day .
that &apos;s not really good for my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s because i don &apos;t play very often with particles .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very much .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one ever saw a particle .
but i &apos;m also not going to get into my logical part .
because if it &apos;s all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t find the reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
and therefore i would feel much better if i could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics .
that &apos;s why a few years ago , i set out to do exactly that .
and i did .
this is the first object you can see that it &apos;s been in a quantum mechanical overlap .
what we see here is a little computer chip .
and you can try to see the green dot right in the middle .
that &apos;s the little bit of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
this is a picture of the object .
and here i &apos;m going to zoom in a little bit . it &apos;s right in the middle .
and then here , we zoom in on a big side to the little metal <unk> .
what we see is a little bit of metal , with a trampoline way of a bow and being supported on a platform .
and so i did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with a silicon chip , and i started running all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last material , i had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the mode of swimming , which is underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap , but it needs a little help .
let me make an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people .
i mean , when i &apos;m in an elevator only , i do all sorts of weird things , but then when other people come up and try and do those things , because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or actually , frightening .
quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way .
the travel mates for all these things are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes up and the heat of the room .
so we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics , we would have to <unk> all the other passengers .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we <unk> the lights , then we introduced a vacuum , and we pulled all the air out , and then we cool it down to a lower temperature of a degree above zero .
now , being alone in the elevator , the little piece of metal is free to act as you want .
so we measured their movements .
we found it moving in very strange ways .
instead of staying still , i was vibrating , and the way i flipped it was like a breath like this -- like a <unk> that stretches out and contract .
and by giving him a nice push , we were able to make it float , and that we didn &apos;t heal at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is really fantastic .
what does it mean that a matter of abuse and not <unk> at the same time ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
in one case : all the billions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are stuck , and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
it &apos;s just in certain directions when those are dancing .
in the rest of the time , they &apos;re <unk> .
it means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which means the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
i think this is great .
really .
it was worth living in a clean room to do this for all those years , because , look at this , the difference in scale between one atom and that little metal is about the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , and that piece of metal can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you too ?
i mean , it &apos;s my logical part that he talks .
so imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time , how would that be ?
how would you affect your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space ?
there &apos;s another part of the story .
and that &apos;s when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and we look inside the box , and we saw that the metal is still in one piece .
and i could get to this new intuition , apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just literally <unk> in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected .
well , that &apos;s not so true .
it &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they have the possibility of choice between at least a whole bunch of different cities which are competing to engage new residents .
well , at this point we &apos;re way away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have one city willing to describe them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that it &apos;s worth much more than their cost of building .
so we could easily skip over the world tens , maybe hundreds of new cities .
well , this may sound absurd if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but it just <unk> through apartment buildings .
imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already owned , and yet half of them would still help him .
you could try to increase the capacity by making all the buildings out there .
but , you know , the problem that you see is that these buildings and the areas around you have rules to avoid the discomfort and the development distractions .
so it would be very difficult to do all those crappy .
but they could go to a whole new place , build a whole new apartments building , always , and when the rules of that place would build the construction rather than putting it in .
so i proposed that governments will bring new area of reform to support cities and give them a name : cities under charter .
later , i learned that more or less at the same time , <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of honduras reform .
they knew that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in honduras .
and at a given moment , <unk> said to <unk> , &quot; what if we were to take <unk> land , and we just gave them a u.s. embassy a little bit , a little bit of u.s. embassy , and then , if people want to go to work under the rules of canada or the united states , it can go to work in the united states .
in the summer of 2009 , he went through a constitutional crisis .
in the next regular election , synthetic genomics have been awarded to a platform on which we collect reforms and at the same time in reconciliation .
he asked <unk> to be his chief of cabinet .
meanwhile , i was preparing to give a talk at tedglobal .
through a process of <unk> , trial and error , and a tremendous amount of user testing , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities beneath their most essential ideas .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t go and bother all the day &apos;s residents .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but we need both technologies and rules to progress , and usually it &apos;s the rules that keep us from moving .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent over a link to the tedtalk .
he showed up at <unk> .
they called me .
and they said , &quot; we will respect this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so , in december , we sat in miami , in a hotel conference room .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , far more valuable than their monetary cost .
and i used this picture that shows the value of land on a place like new york , notice , land that , in some cases , is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , and at some point , when there was a pause , he said , &quot; paul , maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk . &quot;
and the talk described in very simple terms that a city under a charter is a place where you start with <unk> soil , a charter that specifies all the rules that spread out there and a choice so that people can choose whether or not they want to live under those rules .
so , the president of honduras called me , and he said we had to do this project , which is important , this could be the way our country advance .
he asked me to go back and talk again about the four and five of january .
so i presented another talk full of data , which included an image like this , which was trying to explain that to us a lot of value to a city , this has to be very big .
this is a picture of denver , and the white line is the new airport that was built in denver .
this airport alone covers over 100 square kilometers .
so i was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city , you have to start with a site that would build at least 1,000 square kilometers .
that &apos;s over 100,000 acres .
everyone <unk> writes a lot .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attentive .
the leader of congress approached the platform and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you so much for his talk , but maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk .
i have it here in my computer . &quot;
so i sat down and they showed the tedtalk .
and this explained the essentials that a new city can offer new choices for people .
there would be a city option that you might be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away to north .
and they also provide new choices for leaders .
because the government of honduras government would need help from partners , they could benefit from the countries associated that would force them to establish and fulfill the rules of the charter , so that everyone could actually trust the charter .
and what president wolf thought was that that an <unk> that i was considering as a way of engaging the foreign investors in order to <unk> the city could be just as important to all the parties in honduras for so many years for fear and mistrust .
we went and saw a website .
this photo is over there .
it could just encompass a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after , on january 19th , they voted in congress to reform their constitution , and add a constitutional agreement that would allow these special development regions .
in a country that had just passed through this painful crisis , the voting in congress , in favor of this constitutional amendment was one .
all parties , all the factions in society , the <unk> .
to put it in the constitution , you have to pass twice in congress .
february 17th , it was approved again in another voting , from <unk> to one .
immediately after the vote , of 21 to february 24 , a delegation of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities .
one of them is south korea .
this is a picture of a new city center that is being built in south korea ; it &apos;s bigger than the center of boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after it took four years to get the permissions .
the other interested country in city building is singapore .
in fact , they &apos;ve built two cities in china , and they &apos;re preparing for a third .
and if you think about this in a practical way , this is where we are .
they have a site , and they &apos;re already thinking about a place for the second city .
they &apos;re making a legal system that would allow the administrators to come , and at the same time it would allow them to operate under an external legal system .
a country has already committed to allowing its supreme court to be the ultimate court for this new criminal justice system .
there are <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project .
they can even get some funding .
but the only thing we know that they &apos;ve already solved is they have a good number of inhabitants .
there are a lot of companies that want to break into the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to go there .
in the world , there are 700 million people who say they would like to be changed immediately .
there &apos;s a million a year out of latin america to go to the united states .
many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to get a job ; sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make money for just eating or buy clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , in a decade .
so , what do you think about building a new city in honduras ?
or build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these worldwide ?
what does it seem to think about trying to make families choice between cities that are competing to engage new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends urged me to say , &quot; thank you ted . &quot;
do you know how many decisions we make one day ?
do you know how much we choose in a week ?
recently , i did a survey to over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says pick an average american , is about 70 a day .
not so long ago , in research , they went on for a week to a group of game presidents .
the researchers recorded the different tasks -- these ceos and the time they were working with these tasks .
they found that , on average , they found <unk> jobs a week .
of course , each work included a lot of <unk> .
half of those decisions took nine minutes or less .
just 12 percent rush hour or over time .
now think about your choices .
do you know how many people belong to the age of nine minutes , and how many of an hour ?
how do we diagnose the way those decisions drive ?
today , i want to talk about one of the major problems of choice : choice versus choice .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
while i &apos;m talking about this , i &apos;m going to ask you a few questions , and i need to know your answers .
when i ask a question , as i &apos;m blind , raise your hand only if you want to burn calories .
otherwise , when i ask a question , if your answer is positive , please clap your answer .
and now my first question of the day : are you ready to hear about the problem of choice ?
thank you .
being a graduate student at stanford university , <unk> this very , very high @-@ level grocery store , at least at that time , was very sophisticated .
it was called <unk> .
it was almost like going to an amusement park .
there were about 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar , over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of bottled water , and this was when we were shooting water .
i loved going to that store , but one time i asked myself , why didn &apos;t i buy anything ?
this is the olive oil shelf .
they had over 75 different classes , including the ones that were in a sealed box that came out of <unk> trees .
i once decided to go to the manager and say , &quot; is this strategy of offer all these choices ? &quot;
he pointed at the buses full of tourists every day , usually with his cameras .
we decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> . this is the <unk> .
they had different classes .
we set up a seat for <unk> , right at the entrance to the store .
we put there six flavors , or 24 different flavors , and we looked at two things : first , what if people were willing to stop <unk> ?
more people stopped when there was 24 -- 60 percent , than when there was only six , 40 percent .
we also looked at what case they were most likely to buy a <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s the opposite effect .
of those who stopped when he was 24 , only 3 percent came to buy <unk> .
the ones who stopped when there were six , we saw that 30 percent bought <unk> .
if we do the calculations , people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were watching 24 .
well , to decide that we don &apos;t buy -- we probably want it ; we &apos;re less good at keeping -- but it turns out that the problem of choice overload us in a well @-@ momentous decisions .
we decided not to decide , even when this doesn &apos;t hurt us .
now the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i do with <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , where we look at decisions about retirement savings over a million americans , from about 650 plans in this country .
we were interested in seeing if the number of tons of funds available for retirement savings plans , the <unk> program , helping people save for the future .
and we found that there was actually a correlation .
we had phenomenal plans that went from two to 59 different options .
we found that the bigger the number of biomedical funds , the less participation .
so , if you look at the edge , you see that in the plans that are two funds , the participation rate was 70 or more , not as high as you would like .
and in the plans that some 60 funds , the participation rate brought down to 60 .
it turns out even if you decide to engage , when there &apos;s more options , even in that case , there &apos;s negative consequences .
so , for those of you who decided to participate , the bigger the number of choices , the more people would be empowered to avoid the actions or the investment funds .
as soon as there were more options , they were more willing to invest in the financial account of the market .
but none of these extreme decisions are the ones to optimize future wealth .
in the last decade we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities .
the most likely thing is that it <unk> the decision , that it <unk> it even when it comes against self @-@ interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make the worst decisions ; in finance and health .
they &apos;re more likely to pick things less satisfying , even though objectively they &apos;re doing better .
the main reason is that we &apos;re going to start looking at this huge array of <unk> , vinegar , and vinegar , but we &apos;re not able to do the calculations to compare , contrast and choose that amazing exhibition .
today , i want to offer you four simple techniques that we have tried , in one way or another , in different research , so you can actually test in your business .
the first is , cut .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , which is less .
people always get upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they care about losing space in <unk> .
but actually what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut , get rid of odd options , there will be a higher increase in sales , you &apos;ll have a better experience of choice .
when <unk> &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; poor &apos;s guys , saw a 10 percent increase in sales .
when the <unk> regulatory corporation eliminated the products to <unk> the cats &apos; worth killing , they scaled up the slaughter at 87 percent , by two causes : higher sales and lower costs .
you know , supermarkets today , on average , offer 14,000 products .
in a walmart store , you have 100,000 products .
but the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and offers only <unk> products -- a kind of tomato sauce can .
in the world of financial savings , i think one of the best examples that has emerged out of how to handle the best choices is david <unk> &apos;s brand , the harvard conference .
all the harvard employees are automatically embedded in a safe lifestyle .
those who really want to pick , give them 20 funds , not 300 or more .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
they &apos;re all important options . &quot;
the first thing i do is ask employees : &quot; tell me the difference between those choices .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell the difference , they can &apos;t make your customers . &quot;
this afternoon , before i started this session , i was talking to gary .
he told me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience a vacation with all his money to the most beautiful highway in the world .
here , a description .
i want you to read it .
i &apos;m going to leave a few seconds to read it , and then i want you to give it a hand if you &apos;re ready to take the deal of gary .
ok . anyone who &apos;s ready to accept the deal .
aren &apos;t they more ?
well , i &apos;m going to show you something else .
you knew there was a trick .
who &apos;s ready for that journey ?
i think i actually learned more hands .
all right .
actually , you had more information in the first round , than in the second round , but i can tell you that you thought the second time was more real .
because the images made it more real .
this leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of <unk> &apos;s overhead , which is <unk> .
so people understand the difference between choice , they have to understand the consequences of every choice , and that the consequences must feel very deeply , very vivid .
why is it that people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards , when they &apos;re using cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t look real money .
it turns out that making people look more real , it can be a very positive tool for people to feel more .
we did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , on staff of <unk> <unk> who worked at <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan .
that meeting , that we knew exactly how it was used , we made it a little addition .
what we added was that we asked the staff to think about the positive things that they would focus on their lives if they were more money .
with this <unk> , there was a spike in 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or whatever they wanted to put in their savings accounts , four percent .
the third technique is to classify .
we can handle more categories than options .
for example , this is a study that we did in a magazine hall .
we saw that in the <unk> supermarkets , throughout the corridor of the northeast corridor , the exhibition of magazines can hold on from <unk> different types to <unk> .
but , you know ?
if i show you 600 journals and i do it in 10 categories , and i compare it to 400 <unk> in 20 groups , you &apos;ll think i &apos;ve offered them more choices and a better choice experience if i offer that 400 , that if i put 600 .
because the classification indicates how to behave .
these are two pieces of jewelry .
one is called &quot; <unk> &quot; and the other , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the one on the left is <unk> , and the one on the right is <unk> , <unk> a deal .
well , there are some .
if you think the one on the left is <unk> , and the one on the right is <unk> , <unk> a deal .
well , something else .
it turns out it &apos;s right .
the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> . but , you know what ?
this rating diagram is completely useless .
the categories need to indicate something which they choose , not what they call them .
you often see this problem with these huge fundraising lists .
allegedly , who are they informing ?
my fourth category : complexity .
it turns out we can handle a lot more information than we think , if we just manage it a little bit .
we have to increase complexity gradually .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s look at a complicated decision ; buy it from a car .
this is a german car manufacturer that allows you to fully behave .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 decisions , so you can build the car .
and these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each .
color , outdoor color . i &apos;m 56 possibilities .
engine , change box , four choices .
what i &apos;m going to do is vary the order in which decisions come about .
so half the clients are going to go from lots of options , 56 colors , just a few , four boxes .
the other half of the clients are going to go from a few options , four trucks , 56 colors , lots of options .
and what am i going to look at ?
how much you are involved .
if the default button is always in every decision , this indicates they &apos;re overwhelmed , meaning we &apos;re losing them .
we found that those who go from lots of options to a few , press the default button over and over again , and over again .
we miss them .
if you go from a few choices to a lot , they continue there .
the same information , the same number of choices .
the only thing i did was to alter the order where the information is presented .
if we start with the easy thing , you learn to pick .
even though the choice of changes doesn &apos;t say anything about the preferences of interior decoration , in all ways makes us choice .
we &apos;re excited about a product that we &apos;re building that now has more structured to the process .
to sum up .
i &apos;ve talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of choice : cutting , cutting , cutting out odd alternatives ; <unk> ; making it real ; we can arrange more categories with less options ; we can undermine complexity .
all these techniques that i presented to you were designed to help drive the alternatives , or better , for you , to use them in your business , or for the people who serve .
i think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful about the choice .
and the more careful we stay in our choices , the better we can practice choice art .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , the youtube trends , and i look at youtube videos in a professional way .
it &apos;s true .
so today we &apos;re going to see why video is made viral and how important that is .
we all want to be famous stars : celebrities , singers , i -- when i was younger , that seemed very , very difficult .
but today the web video makes any of us , or our actions , copper in a part of our world culture .
anyone can get famous on the internet in a <unk> .
over 48 hours to youtube for a minute .
and , of those , only a small percentage gets viral , you get lots of visitors and you win cultural <unk> .
how does that happen ?
three things : creators , maker communities , participation and surprise factor .
well , let &apos;s start .
oh , my god , my god .
oh , my god !
wow .
ow , ow !
last year , <unk> <unk> published this video clip outside his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was seen 23 million times .
this graph shows the breeding at the rise of popularity of last summer .
<unk> don &apos;t do a viral video .
i just wanted to share a double rainbow .
that &apos;s what you do if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain <unk> .
i had already published a lot of videos of nature .
this video had been published in january .
so , what happened here ?
it was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy wales published this tweet that <unk> video to popularity .
the creators of trends like jimmy <unk> show us new and interesting things and bringing them to a wider audience .
it &apos;s friday . you &apos;ve got to start on friday . everybody wants the weekend to come , on the weekend . friday , starting friday . you wouldn &apos;t think we could have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
&quot; friday , &quot; rebecca is one of the most popular videos in the year .
they saw it almost 200 million times this year .
this graph shows the frequency of use .
just like , &quot; rainbow two , &quot; this video seemed to have emerged out of nowhere .
so , what happened this day ?
well , it &apos;s friday . it &apos;s true .
and if you ask for those other peaks , they &apos;re also friday .
but what happened this day , this particular friday ?
well , he took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it .
michael moschen , of <unk> science theater , was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on twitter .
but what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of creators take a point of view and share it with a wider audience , speeding up the process .
so , this community of people who share this big inner joke then starts talking about it and doing things .
and now there are 10,000 <unk> of friday youtube .
only in the first seven days , there was a parody for every one of the other day .
unlike 20th century entertainment , this communal involvement is our way to be part of the suv phenomenon , or doing something new with that .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation with a <unk> music .
so , that &apos;s it .
this year , they saw it about 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s odd , you know , there &apos;s a three @-@ hour version that &apos;s been seen four million times .
even the cats saw this video .
and there are cats who saw other cats watching the video .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that sparked the internet community .
there was <unk> .
someone made an old version .
and then international became international .
suddenly , there was a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be part of .
because today we don &apos;t just enjoy , we participate .
who could have predicted something like that ?
who could have predicted &quot; <unk> , &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
what a script could have written this situation ?
in a world where two days of video come up with , just that single , unexpected thing can come up with .
when a friend told me that i had to see this great video of a guy who runs against the <unk> of bikers in new york , that i didn &apos;t get very interested .
i &apos;m going down the road not to the <unk> , but there are often obstacles that can get you through the actual store .
thanks to the surprise effect and his humor , casey <unk> managed to get five million of them to understand their idea .
so this approach is worth all the new things that we do in a creative way .
and all this leads to a big question .
what does this mean ?
<unk> .
what does this mean ?
the creators of tendency , the creative communities of participation , the whole unexpected , are features of a new kind of media , a new culture , that we all have access to , and is the audience that defines popularity .
as i said before , one of the current celebrities of the world , justin bieber , started on youtube .
don &apos;t ask permission to express your ideas .
now , we &apos;re all a little owners of our pop culture .
these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re just the ones of today &apos;s media , but <unk> the future &apos;s entertainment .
thank you .
how i can dive in 10 minutes about women &apos;s links for more than three generations , how the incredible force of those ties is scattered into the life of a four @-@ year @-@ old girl , next to her sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the sea of china , over 30 years ago , that girl never lives .
this is not a finished story .
it &apos;s a jigsaw puzzle which is still <unk> .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who is burning the work of a whole life .
he &apos;s a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been supported by the single hope of unity and freedom of his country .
<unk> as the communist <unk> , <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain .
the words , so long as a friend of mine , now we will .
he was silent .
he died through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never allowed me to forget her story .
my job was not to let that have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that history was tried to hate it , but it was insane .
the next part of the puzzle is about a boat in the back of the sea .
my mother , <unk> , was only 18 years old when her father died , and a marriage and two little girls .
for her , life had been devoted to one task : the escape from her family and a new life in australia .
it was inconceivable for her that she could not do it .
and after a four @-@ year @-@ old <unk> who defies fiction , a boat <unk> into the sea of <unk> ship .
all adults knew the risks .
the biggest fear was pirates , rape and death .
like most adults , my mother was wearing a poison <unk> .
if i could catch up , we would first take my sister and i would , and then she and my grandmother .
my first memories are from that boat , the constant pace of the engine , the <unk> in every wave , and the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came several times , but they were <unk> with the courage of the men on our ship , or the engine dying and not being able to break for six hours .
but i do remember the lights on the oil platform front of the coast of malaysia , and the young man who collapsed and died , finishing the journey was too much for him , and the first apple i tried , given by the men on the platform .
no apple then had the same flavor .
after three months in a refugee camp , <unk> in melbourne .
and the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations , making a new life together .
we set up in <unk> , a group of workers whose population is comprised of immigrants .
unlike the middle @-@ class suburbs , whose existence , in <unk> , there was no sense of the right .
the smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world .
and the bits of english are coming in between the people who had a common thing : they were starting again .
my mother worked in farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , twice .
yet , he found time to study english and get a degree in it .
we were poor .
all the dollars were flooded , and there was an extra <unk> record in english and math , not mind what was supposed to be taken away , which was usually new clothing ; it was always a second hand .
two mid @-@ school pairs , one to hide holes in the other .
a school uniform up to the ankles , because it had to last six years .
and there were freaks and <unk> over the <unk> eyes and some graffiti : &quot; <unk> , come home . &quot;
where ?
something about me is being <unk> .
i was accumulating determination and a voice saying , &quot; i &apos;m going to fix it . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i <unk> in the same bed .
my mother was <unk> every night , but we told us about our day and we <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home .
my mother ached , all the ship .
and my task was to be awake until its nightmares began in order to nurse him .
she opened up a computer shop , then studied to be a <unk> and opened another business .
and the women would come with their stories about men who couldn &apos;t make the transition , angry and <unk> , and kids would come in between two worlds .
they looked for subsidies and sponsors .
and they created centers .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , it was the classic asian student , <unk> with what <unk> of myself was .
on the other hand , i was <unk> in <unk> lives , tragically , by violence , abuse of drugs and isolation .
but a lot of help from the years .
and because of that work , when i studied my last year of <unk> , i was elected to the united states of the year .
and i was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other , but its edges didn &apos;t match .
so le <unk> , anonymous <unk> , was now le <unk> , <unk> and social activist , invited to speak at sites that i never heard before , and in homes that she would never have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
i didn &apos;t know how to use <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about it .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to withdraw to the living and the living thing in a lifetime -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , ending up as they did for almost 20 years , <unk> on the day of every single and a <unk> , the three still in bed .
and i told my mom i couldn &apos;t do it .
it reminded me that i had now the same age that she had when we got on the boat .
the &quot; had never been a choice .
do it , &quot; he said , &quot; and not be what you &apos;re not going to do . &quot;
so i talked about juvenile <unk> and education and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> .
and the more frankly i was talking about , the more i was glad to speak .
i met people from all walks of life , a lot of them doing what they loved , living on the border of the possible .
and although i finished my undergraduate degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t stay in a career of <unk> .
there had to be another piece of the puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s well being a stranger , a very recently arrived at the scene -- not only that it &apos;s okay , but it &apos;s something to be grateful for , perhaps a gift of the ship .
because being inside can easily mean <unk> the horizons , it can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your province .
i gave the enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that , yes , the world is silent , but not the way we fear .
possibilities that had not been tremendously <unk> .
there was an energy there , a <unk> optimism , a rare mix of humility and courage .
so i followed my intuition .
i joined a small group of people who the slogan &quot; couldn &apos;t be done &quot; was a compelling challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
at the end of every day , he was making a giant soup pot that we all shared .
we worked until the actual entrance to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but some brilliant , and we just kind of came to us .
i made the decision to get it to the u.s.
after just a journey .
my hunch again .
three months later , i had moved , and adventure continued .
before i finish , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who cared .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after she was born .
the mother grew up alone .
when he was 17 , he became a mandarin <unk> whose mother beat him up .
without the support of her husband , he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and to hold the cause himself , and much more <unk> caused when he won .
the &quot; can &apos;t be done &quot; showed up .
i was in the shower at the front of a hotel in sydney when she died , a mile away in melbourne .
i looked through the shower and the other side stop .
i knew i had come to <unk> .
my mother called for minutes later .
days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around their coffin .
we tell stories and we make sure that we were still with it .
at night a monk came in and said he had to close his coffin .
my mother asked us to hold her hand .
he asked the monk : &quot; why is his hand hot , and the rest of the body so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve taken your hand since the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they haven &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a nerve in our family , it runs through women .
since we were and how life formed us , we can now see that the men who would have come to our lives would have frustrated us .
the defeat would have easily melted .
now i want to have my own kids , and i wonder about the boat .
who could wish for that ?
yet , i fear the privilege of the easy , the right .
can i give you a <unk> in your life , a courageous , in every wave , the constant pace of the engine , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give you and see them safe , i would .
<unk> <unk> and also the <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth line .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph .
or is it a photograph ?
because , of course , they &apos;re pictures that they can &apos;t take with their cameras .
my interest in photography was introduced to my first digital camera to the age of 15 .
he <unk> with my previous passion for the drawing , but he was a little different because using the camera , the process was in planning .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends up when you click the <unk> .
for me photography had more to do with being in the right place , at the right time .
it seemed like everybody could do it .
so i wanted to create something different , a process that started pressing <unk> the <unk> .
photos like this : a very <unk> road building .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and , despite that , it holds a level of <unk> .
or pictures like these -- dark and colorful pictures at a time , but with the common purpose of keeping the realism level .
and when i say <unk> , i say <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that can happen , but i always want it to be captured in some way like photography .
photos where you &apos;re going to have to think for a moment to discover the trick .
it has more to do with capturing an idea that has to capture a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes them look real ?
are the details , or the colors ?
does the light intervene ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the illusion is perspective .
but in the end , it &apos;s our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a two @-@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s actually not about whether it &apos;s realistic , it &apos;s about what we think it &apos;s realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality .
let me show you a simple example .
so , here we have three objects which is something that we can all relate to the three @-@ dimensional world .
but they combined , in a way , they can create something that still looks three @-@ dimensional , as if it existed .
but at the same time , we know it doesn &apos;t exist .
so , look at the brain , because the brain doesn &apos;t really accept the fact that that doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process by combining pictures .
it really is about combining different realities .
and the things that make a photo look realistic , i think it &apos;s those that we don &apos;t even think of -- the things that surround us in our everyday life .
but when we combine pictures , it &apos;s very important to consider it , because otherwise something will look bad .
so i &apos;d like to say , there are three simple rules that i &apos;m going to follow to make realistic results .
as you can see , these pictures are not very special .
but combined , you can create something like this .
so the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective .
second , pictures combined must have the same kind of light .
and these two pictures play with these requirements , they &apos;re taken at the same height and with the same kind of light .
the third thing is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of all different images with a perfect union .
it has to be impossible to see where the image is going to be .
by measuring the color , the contrast and the <unk> on the edges that are in between the images , adding birth defects , <unk> colors and noise , <unk> the boundaries between the various images and making it look a single , although a picture can actually have hundreds of layers .
this is another example .
you might think this is the picture of a landscape , and the bottom is filtered .
but this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places .
personally , i think it &apos;s easier to create a place that you find out because you don &apos;t need to put the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and as i thought about this idea in winter , i knew that i had several months to come up with different locations for the puzzle pieces .
for example , the fish was captured on a fishing journey .
the shoreline is of a different location .
the <unk> part was captured in a stone pit .
and yes , i even did a red house on the top of the island so it sounds more swedish .
so to make a realistic result , i think we need planning .
you always start with a sketch , an idea .
then you have to combine the different photographs .
and here , every piece is really cool .
if you do a good job when you take the pictures , it can be very beautiful and very realistic .
all the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about why a lot of projects and health care fail .
and i think , really , the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at <unk> university was we <unk> a director of the listening .
and not in a very scientific way , she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients , family and they know , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
&quot; how can we help it ? &quot;
and we tend to think , this is one of the biggest problems that everyone else , or maybe not all , but most of the health and health care projects fail , because we stop listening .
this is my logarithmic scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it has a flip switch and off .
every morning i get up .
and yes , i have a challenge as you can see .
i set the challenge up to 95 kilograms .
but it &apos;s so simple that every time i link to you , it sends my information to google health .
and my doctor at <unk> has access to him too . so , he can see what my weight problem is , not at the same time when he needs any assistance , or any urgency of that kind , but to see it backwards .
but there &apos;s another thing .
as some of you know , i have over 4,000 followers on twitter .
so , every morning i &apos;m going to link to a <unk> , and before i get up to my car , people start telling me , &quot; aw , today i think you need a light lunch . &quot;
that &apos;s the best thing that can happen , because it &apos;s peer pressure , used to help patients , because it could be used for obesity , and also for patients to stop smoking .
on the other hand , it can help us move people from their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control over their health .
from next week , it will be available .
this little pixel in an iphone , or another device .
and people will be able , from their homes , take their blood pressure , send it to their doctor , share it with others , for example , for 100 dollars .
this is the point where patients assume a position , they come back to their control and to be sketches on their own boat , but it can also help us care of health care because of the challenges that we face , like the firing of the costs of attention , demand and other issues .
making techniques that are simple to use and start with this to involve patients in the team .
and you can do it with techniques like this , but also , through crowdsourcing .
and one of the things that we did want to share with you .
we all have car navigation controls .
maybe we even have them in our phones .
we know perfectly where the atms are .
also where are all the <unk> .
and of course , we can find fast food chains .
but where is the closest <unk> to help this patient ?
so , we didn &apos;t know .
no one knew where to get saving lives right now .
so , what we did was we <unk> the netherlands .
we created a website , and we asked the public to say , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please tell us where , and when it &apos;s open , &quot; because sometimes you open up in offices and other people are closed .
and over 10,000 hertz , they were introduced in the netherlands .
the next step was looking for the application for that .
and we did an app for the ipad .
we create an app for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these <unk> .
and every time you &apos;re in the city of <unk> and someone &apos;s collapses , you can use your iphone , and in the next few weeks , use your phone from microsoft to find the nearest <unk> , which can save lives .
and from today , i would like to present this one , not just as <unk> <unk> , which is the name of the product , but also as <unk> .
and we <unk> them globally .
we &apos;re forcing all the colleagues in the world , in other universities , to help us find , work and act as a crowdsourcing , throughout the world .
every time you &apos;re on holiday and someone , it can be a relative or someone in front of you , you can find it .
i also would like to invite companies around the world that they could help us challenge these <unk> .
they could be fedex or phone services , for example , to see if the <unk> that &apos;s shown is still in place .
please , focus on this and not only improve health , but to take control of it .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little company is trying to engage the environment in mind .
extended collaboration .
this is a little video of what we do .
mm : wait a minute .
you can take a little bit of a ride .
we can -- we can continue -- we better leave the video on the side ...
no .
this is not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
oh , i mean , you know ?
all right . thank you very much .
a couple of years ago , i set up an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we &apos;re supposed to do , and we asked them to work in government .
the initiative was called america &apos;s <unk> , and it would be like some <unk> <unk> of peace .
we select a few members every year , and we got them to work with the municipalities .
instead of sending them to the third world , we sent them to the wild city world .
they made big apps ; they worked with employees .
his homework is about showing the possibilities of current technology .
meet al .
it &apos;s a fire hydrant from the city of boston .
here it appears as if i &apos;m walking around , but what i &apos;m really looking for is someone who has been <unk> by the snow , because he knows it &apos;s not very good at putting fires when he &apos;s covered by a foot of snow .
how did it come to ask for help in this particular way ?
last year in boston , we had a team of members of code for america .
they were there in february , and at that time they were so much last year .
they realized that the city never wiped out these <unk> .
but one of the members called erik <unk> @-@ <unk> , he noticed something more : citizens compared to <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them .
so he did as any good programmer , he developed an app .
it &apos;s a nice application in which you can take a fire hydrant .
you accept when you win .
by doing so , you put a name on it , in this case , he placed al .
if you don &apos;t , someone can fake it .
so , it has a playful component .
it &apos;s a modest application .
maybe it &apos;s the smallest of the twenty @-@ four applications that have happened last year .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
and it spreads in viral form .
a responsible driver of <unk> &apos;s city , looking at this application , realized that he could use it , not for snow , but for citizens to embrace the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these tar sands work , but people steal batteries .
that &apos;s why it calls citizens to control .
and then seattle decided to use it so that citizens would prescribe the <unk> .
and chicago just came out there to get people to clean up to clear sidewalks when they were .
so , now we know nine cities that we use to use it .
and this has spread out <unk> , organically .
if you know a little bit about government technology , you &apos;ll know that this doesn &apos;t happen normally .
the software acquisition usually takes a couple of years .
last year in boston , we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months .
it was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children .
then we were told that , in fact , for the normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and a half million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
now , there &apos;s a project in the california <unk> that &apos;s up until now two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so , an app which shows up in a couple of days and spreads in viral form is a kind of warning about the institution of government .
it suggests the best way to work , not as in private enterprises , as many people think it should be .
neither as a technology company , but rather as the internet itself .
i mean , no constraints , in the open , <unk> way .
and that &apos;s important .
but the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of approaching the question of the government that has the new generation -- not as a problem of an institution -- but as a collective action problem .
and that &apos;s very good because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
and there &apos;s a very large community of people who are building the tools to build them together effectively .
and it &apos;s not just &quot; u.s. code , &quot; but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to civic apps every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up with government .
they feel great frustration to that , but they don &apos;t complain , they fix it .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost sight .
and that is , if we stop the feelings about politics , row in the front lines and all those other things that put us crazy , the government is , essentially , in the words of tim o <unk> : &quot; what we do together because we cannot . &quot;
now , a lot of people have moved the government .
if you &apos;re one of those people , you &apos;d ask them to reform it , because things are changing .
politics does not change ; government does .
and because the government ultimately generates of us -- remember that of &quot; we , the people &quot; ? the way we think about it will affect the way we make change .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started with this .
and as a lot of people thought that the government was about choice to make people charge .
well , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that government is , above all , a matter of <unk> .
this is the website of service and information .
it &apos;s the place that manages phone calls if you mark the u.s.
if you ever have the opportunity to work in a city call center , scott <unk> like part of this initiative -- in fact , everybody will find that people call the government with a very broad range of issues , even when it finds a <unk> at home .
scott <unk> this call .
<unk> entered the official knowledge base .
he found nothing . he started with animal control .
and finally he said , &quot; hey , can you open the doors of the house , put in loud music and see if it &apos;s gone ? &quot;
and it worked . so , scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
boston has no call center .
it has an app , web and mobile phone , called <unk> .
don &apos;t give that application .
it was the work of very smart people at the office of new york <unk> mechanical .
one day , this really happened , came up with this request , &quot; <unk> in my garbage cube . i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s dead .
how do i make it work ? &quot;
<unk> &apos;s dynamic is different .
scott was speaking in person .
freestyle itself is public , so everyone can see this .
in this case , he saw a neighbor .
the next report said , &quot; i went to the place , i found the garbage cube behind the house .
okay ? yes . yes .
i turn the bucket . i went home .
good evening , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the confluence of digital and physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of the income of government to extended aid .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and here i don &apos;t necessarily mean the technological definition of platform technology .
i talk about a platform for people to come in and help others .
so , a citizen helped another citizen , but here the government had a key role .
he connected the two people .
and it could be connected with government services to be needed , but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative , than government services .
when a neighbor helps another , it <unk> communities .
if we call animal control , that costs a lot of money .
one important thing that we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same as politics .
a lot of people understand it , but think you &apos;re the other person &apos;s input .
our entry into the government system is voting .
how many times have you chosen a political leader , sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we expect the government to <unk> our values and understand our needs , but then we don &apos;t see changes .
that &apos;s because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 .
below that &apos;s what we call bureaucracy .
and we say that word with a lot of contempt .
but that &apos;s the contempt of what that really belongs to us that we sort of something that operates on our counter , that other thing , and therefore we &apos;re losing power .
people think politics is sensual .
if we want this institution to work , we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government work happens .
we have to collaborate with government machinery .
that &apos;s what <unk> movement does .
have you seen them ?
it &apos;s a group of very optimistic citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the <unk> of the financial reform project .
that &apos;s not political activism , it &apos;s bureaucratic activism .
and for those of us who have been invited to government , it &apos;s time for us to ask what world we want to leave our children .
you have to see the huge challenges that they have to face .
do you really believe that we &apos;re going to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in the name of everyone ?
we cannot do it without government ; we need it to be more effective .
the good news is that with technology , it is possible to rethink the root function of government in a way that can expand the civil society .
there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and he knows that it &apos;s not that hard to act by <unk> , you just have to articulate the systems in the right way .
the average age of our members is 28 years old , so i , to <unk> , is a greater generation than many of them .
this is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost by sitting .
they &apos;re not giving that battle that we all face about who &apos;s going to talk about ; they &apos;re all going to talk .
they can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do .
so when they face the government problem , they don &apos;t really care about making their voices heard .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they put hands on the work to program applications that make government better work better .
and those apps allows us to use our hands to improve our communities .
it can be burning a fire hydrant , taking weeds , casting a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside .
of course , we were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> , and a lot of people do .
but these applications are like digital <unk> that we &apos;re not only consumers , we &apos;re not just consumers of government who pay taxes and we get services .
we &apos;re more than that : we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix the government until we don &apos;t raise citizenship .
so , i want to ask everybody here , when it comes to the important things that we have to do together , all of us together , will we be a crowd of voices , or will we also be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
i usually try to explain to people the wonderful thing that are going to be the new technologies that are emerging . you have to look back to understanding what &apos;s going on . here among friends , i want to tell you what i think of these big technological advances , so we can barely slow down .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a slide about technology , very boring .
please , if you can put it in ...
it &apos;s a diagram anyone i took out of a folder .
i &apos;m not so interested in showing you the details , but the general thing .
this is an analysis we were doing on the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that this , as many other people we tend to see , is sort of a straight line on a log scale .
in other words , each step here represents an order of magnitude in the yield scale .
talking about technology with curved curves is something new .
here &apos;s a weird thing .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m going to talk about .
please turn on the lights .
it would need more intensity because it lacked paper .
why would you change technological curves on <unk> ?
the answer is , if you were to draw them on a normal line where , say , these are the years , or some unit of time , and this would be any measure of the technology that i would like , the diagram would look ridiculous .
it would be something like that .
it doesn &apos;t say a lot .
but if you look at it , for example , some other technology , like transportation , on a hot spot , it would be very silly , we would see a straight line .
but if something like this happens , you get a qualitative change .
if the transport technology would go as fast as the microprocessors , past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
but we don &apos;t move through that pace .
there is no precedent in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years advance from magnitude .
the thing i want to make is -- we look at these exponential curves , we see they don &apos;t go forever .
it &apos;s not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes .
it will happen one of two things .
or it will become a typical s @-@ shaped curve like this until something completely different comes out , or maybe it will do something like that .
that &apos;s all that can happen .
i &apos;m optimistic , so i think maybe something like this will happen .
if we were , then we would be in the middle of a transition .
in this line , we &apos;re in a transition from what used to be the world , to a new way .
so what i &apos;m trying to ask , and to ask myself , is : what is that new way around the world ?
where is the new state going ?
the transition seems very , very fuzzy if you &apos;re embedded in it .
i remember as a child , the future was happening in the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
this is a conference where people talk about the future , and we see that the future is still 2000 .
that &apos;s all we see .
in other words , the future has collapsed , year after year , throughout my life .
but i think it &apos;s because we feel something &apos;s going on .
that &apos;s a transformation . we can feel it .
and we know that it doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense to think of 30 or 50 years , because it &apos;s all going to be so different that we &apos;re doing today doesn &apos;t make any sense .
so i want to talk to you about how that might be , how could that transition that we experience .
but to do that , i &apos;m going to have to talk a little bit about things that don &apos;t have a lot to do with technology and computers .
because i think the only way to understand it is to take distances and look at things over the long term .
the time scale i &apos;d like to do that is the time of life on earth .
i think this picture makes sense if we look at it every billion years .
so , we go back about 2.5 billion years when the earth was a big barren rock with a lot of chemicals <unk> around it .
if you look at the way those chemicals organized , you give us an idea of how things happened .
and i think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of rna . i &apos;m going to tell you a simple version of this , and that is , at the time , there were some oil <unk> out of all kinds of chemical recipes inside .
some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside , so the blobs grew up .
and they started to divide .
in a sense , those were the most primitive cell forms -- those oil spills .
but those drops were not alive , in the current sense , because each of them had a random recipe for chemicals .
and every time it was harvested , an unequal distribution of the chemicals inside .
so every single <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the blobs that were somehow getting better than the time to incorporate the chemicals around , grew more chemical into it and grew more chemical into it .
they were usually living longer ; they were more represented .
it was a form of life , chemistry life , very simple , but things got interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction .
in a way that we don &apos;t really understand very well , these <unk> learned how to store information .
they learned to store information , which was the recipe for the cell , in a special chemical called dna .
in other words , <unk> in this completely pointless evolution , a writing system that allowed them to record what was amazing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years ago .
our recipe , our genes , have exactly the same code , that same writing system .
in fact , every living thing is expressed exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
and one of the things i did just for fun -- we can now write things with this code .
here i have 100 <unk> of white dust that i try to hide people from airport security .
but it contains -- <unk> this code -- the code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and i wrote my personal data into this excerpt of dna and gave it 10 to 22 times .
so if someone wants to 100 million copies of my personal card , i have many for everyone here -- in fact , for every single person in the world and is here .
if he was a <unk> , he would have put him in a virus and he would have spread him through the room .
what was the next step ?
writing dna was an interesting step .
this made these cells happy . another billion years .
but then there was another big interesting step in which things got really different , and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know it , but bacteria can exchange dna .
so , for instance , evolved antibiotic resistance .
some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and develop their little dna with other bacteria and now there &apos;s a lot of penicillin because bacteria communicate .
this communication gave rise to communities that , in a way , were together in that , and there was a synergy .
so , you know , sort of glorified , or you know , if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were getting more and more <unk> by evolution .
and the turning point happened when these communities came so close that , in fact , they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community to come together in a string of dna .
the next interesting stage for life took another billion years .
and at that stage , we have multicellular communities , communities of many different kinds of cells working together as one organism alone .
in fact , we are a <unk> community .
we have lots of cells that don &apos;t act alone .
the skin cell doesn &apos;t work without the heart , or the muscle cell , or the brain , and so on .
so , these communities evolved and bred more interesting levels than cell phones , something we call an organism .
the next level happened within these communities .
these started <unk> information .
and building very special structures that they didn &apos;t do more than process information in community .
these are the neural structures .
neurons are the devices that process information that those mobile communities built .
in fact , they started pouring into the community , being responsible for processing structures , understanding and transmit information .
those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that moment as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism , not the evolutionary period .
so , an organism could , for example , learn not to eat any fruit , because he knew badly and sick the last time he ate it .
that could happen during the life of an organism , because they had previously built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals that ate that fruits .
so the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information that extremely well @-@ evolutionary process .
because evolution could now happen confined to an individual .
it could happen in time necessary to learn .
but then , of course , the individuals discovered the trick of communication .
so , for example , the most refined version we know is human language .
if we think about it , it &apos;s an amazing invention .
i have a very complicated idea , a vague idea in my head .
i &apos;m here sitting emitting some <unk> and , hopefully , building a similar idea , vague and fuzzy , in his head that keeps some analogy to mine .
but we take something very complicated , we converted it into sound , in sound sequences , and we produce something very complicated in another brain .
that now allows us to start working like an organism .
in fact , as humanity , we &apos;ve started doing <unk> .
now we go through very similar periods to the multicellular organisms -- we set up our record methods , presentation and information processing .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
so , the computer , the video cassette , the cd @-@ rom , and so on , are the big surgical mechanisms that we &apos;re now building that information .
and that brings us into something much bigger , faster and able to evolve than we were doing before .
now evolution can happen at microseconds .
you saw the evolutionary <unk> in which there was some evolution with the <unk> program , before our eyes .
and now we &apos;ve accelerated the time again .
the first phase of the story i told you about had a billion years each .
the next stage , the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
the next one , the language . they took less than a million years .
and the next , like the electronics , it just seems to take a few decades .
the process <unk> ; i guess self @-@ organizing is the correct word for something that <unk> its own pace of change .
the more it changes , the faster it does .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at in this explosion of the curve .
we see the process <unk> .
but i get a living designing computers , and i know that the mechanisms that i work to make may not be possible without the recent technological advances .
but now design objects of such complexity would be impossible for me to predict it in a conventional way .
i don &apos;t know what each transistor is doing .
there are billions .
instead of that , with the designers of <unk> <unk> , we think of a level of abstraction , we put it in the machine and the machine that does something that you couldn &apos;t do before , it gets much further and faster than ever before .
in fact , sometimes it uses methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
a particularly interesting method that i &apos;ve been using lately is evolution itself .
inside the machine , an evolutionary process , which operates on the scale of microseconds .
and , for example , in the most extreme cases , we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions .
we say , &quot; for computer , can you run a hundred million randomly instruction sequences ?
would you run these sequences of random instructions , running all those programs , and take those who are more convinced to what we want to do ? &quot;
in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to point out numbers , just to give you a simple example .
so , we found the programs that come closer to <unk> numbers .
of course , it &apos;s unlikely a few random instructions , to cut numbers , so none of them succeeded .
but one , fortunately , could put two numbers in the right order .
and i said , &quot; computer , could you take 10 percent of those random random sequences they did best ?
he <unk> those and <unk> the rest .
and now they best ordered the numbers .
and let &apos;s go back to <unk> doing an analog process to sex . &quot;
let &apos;s take two programs , we need kids , we &apos;re going to study them , and we &apos;re going to test the properties of both programs .
so we got a new generation of software programs that had a little more successful .
and we say , &quot; please repeat the process . &quot;
try it again .
you put in some mutations .
and it tries again and it <unk> with another generation .
well , every generation takes a few milliseconds .
so , i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or , in complicated cases , in hours .
in the end , we ended up with programs which report numbers absolutely perfect .
in fact , these are much more efficient programs than i could have written by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i &apos;ve been trying to analyze it to see how they work .
these are dark , strange programs .
but they do .
in fact , i know , i have the security that they achieve the goal because they come from a hundred thousand @-@ thousand software lineage that they did .
in fact , their lives depended on doing that .
once i went on a 747 with ubuntu and figures out a card and say , &quot; look at this .
he says , &quot; this plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a safe flight . &quot; does it not make you feel quiet ? &quot;
we know that engineering processes don &apos;t work very well when they get complicated .
so we started to rely on computers to make very different design processes .
and that allows us to produce much more complex things than what normal engineering does .
however , we don &apos;t understand all the choices there are .
in that respect , it goes ahead of us .
now we use these programs to make much quicker computers , so we can run these programs much faster .
i mean , it &apos;s <unk> .
the thing goes up faster and faster , and i think it looks so fuzzy .
because all these technologies are coming together .
we are drowning .
and we &apos;re at an analogous time to the grid organisms when they become multicellular .
we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t understand what the hell we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re at the tipping point .
but i think something comes behind us .
i think it would be really arrogant about our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all part of the creation of whatever it comes to .
but now , lunch comes , and i think i &apos;ll stop here before i get sick .
my story begins in <unk> about two years ago .
i was in the desert , under the <unk> skies , with the evangelical <unk> singer .
we were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient indian <unk> &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
in those days when indian people wanted to travel , we wanted to ride a car , we would rip the sky .
now we do it with airplanes .
at that time when <unk> , the great indian warrior , he had thirst , he was dragging out a bow and a <unk> on the ground , he got water .
now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines .
the conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic .
and that made me really depressed .
every time i felt a little more about myself .
i was struck by this idea of losing the capacity to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if i didn &apos;t have the camera , if i couldn &apos;t afford my friends .
it seemed like technology had to allow magic , not succeeding .
as a child , my grandfather gave me his silver <unk> .
and this 50 @-@ year @-@ old piece of technology was for me the most magic thing .
it became a golden gateway to a world full of images , of pirates and <unk> in my imagination .
i had a sense that mobile phone , luxury clocks , and the cameras keep pouring in .
we <unk> our inspiration .
so i set out , i jumped into this technological world to see how to use it to create magic , rather than owning it .
i am illustrating books since 16 years .
so when i saw the ipad , i saw a storytelling device able to connect readers of the whole world .
you can know how we take the book .
where we are .
you gather the text with the image , the animation , the sound and the touch .
narration becomes increasingly <unk> .
but what &apos;s good for ?
i &apos;m about to launch <unk> , an interactive app for ipad .
it says , &quot; puts your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- <unk> : &quot; this box belongs to &quot; -- i write my name .
and so i go back to a book character .
in a number of moments , i get a ticket -- the ipad knows where i live from gps -- which is driven to me .
my inner child gets excited by all these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
and i don &apos;t mean magicians and dragons , but that magic of childhood , to those ideas that we call children .
for some reason , fireflies in a jar were always exciting .
so , over here , we have to decode the ipad to unlock fireflies .
and , actually , they cut off your way into what the book is .
another idea that i was fascinated with as a child was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk> .
so here , every book and every world transforms into a <unk> device that i <unk> into this magic device inside the device .
and this opens up a map .
in every fantasy book , there have always been maps , but there have been synthetic maps .
this is a map that grows , <unk> and guide you through the rest of the book .
in certain points of the book , it also reveals .
now i &apos;m going to go in .
another extremely important thing for me is to create indian content and contemporary time .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of fairies and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian counterparts , the <unk> ?
these poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of indra for millennia , in an old , <unk> book .
so we &apos;re bringing them back to a contemporary child story .
in a story that deals with issues today as the environmental crisis .
and , speaking of the environmental crisis , one of the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked up , glued to their pcs , have not gone outside the world .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids out into the natural world with their technology .
one of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go outside , take the camera or the ipad , and collect images from different objects .
as a child , i had a lot of collections : sticks , stones , <unk> and shells .
for some reason , kids don &apos;t .
so , to get back to this ritual of childhood , you have to go out and , in a chapter , have a picture of a flower and then proceed .
in another chapter , you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then proceed .
so , you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the web .
a kid in london puts a picture of a fox and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox . &quot;
a boy in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taken .
within the variants of connection between magic , earth and technology , there are many possibilities .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to have an interaction where you come out with the ipad , and the video is controlled , and you actually see a bunch of <unk> that appear on the inside of the house .
at one point , the screen is full of leaves .
and you have to make the sound of the wind and the <unk> so you can read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology are coming up with one another .
we take the energy of the sun .
we &apos;re approaching our children and ourselves into the natural world and that magic , joy and child love that we feel through a simple story .
thank you .
this is for me a real honor .
i &apos;ve spent most of the time in prisons , prisons and death row .
i &apos;ve spent most of my life in <unk> communities , in projects and places where there is so much despair .
and being here at ted , watching and listening to these stimuli has given me a lot of energy .
one of the things i &apos;ve noticed in this short time is that ted has identity .
and the things that are said here are impact on everybody .
occasionally , if something comes from ted , it makes sense and a force that would not have otherwise .
i say this because i think identity is important .
here we &apos;ve seen fantastic presentations .
and i think we &apos;ve learned that words from a teacher can make a lot of sense , but if you &apos;re taught with feeling , you can have a special meaning .
a doctor can do good things , fake things , if it &apos;s <unk> , can do much more .
so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t really learn this in the practice of the right , my job .
i learned it from my grandmother .
i grew up in a traditional home of an african @-@ american family dominated for a matriarch , who was my grandmother .
it was hard ; it was hard ; it had power .
it was the last word in the entire family .
she <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home .
he was a daughter of people who had been slaves .
his parents were born in slavery in virginia over the 1840 .
she was born on the 1880 and her experience with slavery in a way that she saw the world .
she was hard , but she was also loving .
when i was a little kid and i watched her , she would come up and give me a good hug .
i was so strong that i could barely breathe , and then i was overwhelmed .
one or two hours later , i would come back and look at her , and she would come up and say , &quot; <unk> , do you still feel my hug ? &quot;
and if he said no , he would take me back and he would say yes , he would leave me alone .
it had this human quality that made you want to always be close to it .
the only problem is , i had 10 kids .
my mother was the youngest of 10 .
occasionally , when i was going to spend a time with her , it wasn &apos;t easy to get their time and attention .
my cousins were running all over the place .
i remember when i was eight or nine years old , i woke up one morning , i went to the room and there they were running all my cousins .
my grandmother was beside the room , and she looked at me .
at first i thought it was a game .
so i looked at her and looked at her , but she was very serious .
after 15 or 20 minutes , she got up , walks across the room , took me out of my hand and said , &quot; you see me . we &apos;re going to discuss them . &quot;
i remember this like yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
it took me outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you can &apos;t tell anyone . &quot;
i said , &quot; it &apos;s okay , <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; now you &apos;ll act that you won &apos;t . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
then he sat me down , and he said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
he said , &quot; i think you can do whatever you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget it .
then he said , &quot; i just want you to give me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
and he said , &quot; what i want you to do first is , we always want your mother . &quot;
he said , &quot; she &apos;s my <unk> , &quot; and you &apos;ve got to make sure you always wear her . &quot;
as i <unk> my mom , i said , &quot; yes , <unk> , i will . &quot;
then he said , &quot; well , the second thing i want you to do is , you &apos;ll always do the right thing , even though it &apos;s hard . &quot;
i thought about it , i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;ll pray . i will . &quot;
then finally , he said , &quot; the third thing i want you to give me is that i never eat alcohol . &quot;
i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , <unk> , i will . &quot;
i grew up in the field , in rural , and i have a brother a year bigger and a sister for a younger year .
when i was 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home with a six @-@ beers , i don &apos;t know where he got it , he grabs my sister and i left for the forest .
we &apos;re just getting crazy stuff all the time .
he took a sip of beer , gave my sister a little bit , and offered me to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . you follow , but i &apos;m not going to take beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; come on . i &apos;ll measure it now , and you always do the same thing as us .
i &apos;ve already taken something , your sister , too . take a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; no . i won &apos;t feel good . you can follow . &quot;
then my brother looks at me .
and he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? take a beer . &quot;
it broke my eyes with force , and it went , &quot; oh , it &apos;s not going to still be thinking about the conversation with <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; but what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; but baby tells all the grandchildren that are special . &quot;
i was terrified .
i have to admit something to you .
i &apos;ll tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t say .
i know this is widely <unk> .
but i have 52 years , and i can admit that i &apos;ve never taken a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying this by thinking it &apos;s a virtue ; i say it to the power of identity .
when we create the right type of identity , we say things to others that really don &apos;t make sense .
we can &apos;t get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
i think my grandmother naturally believed that all her grandchildren were special .
my grandfather had been in jail for the ban .
my uncles died from diseases related to alcohol .
and these were the things that we , according to her , had to commit .
now , i &apos;m going to try and talk about our criminal justice system .
this country is now very different than it was 40 years ago .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 prisoners .
today , there are 2.3 million .
in america , we have the largest incarceration rate in the world .
we have seven million people in liberty .
and this mass incarceration , in my view , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor , black communities , you find so much <unk> , so much despair , determined by these facts .
one in three black people between 18 and 30 years is in jail or in liberty .
in urban <unk> across the country , los angeles , baltimore , washington , 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail or in <unk> freedom .
our system is not only distorted in front of the race , but it &apos;s also about poverty .
in this country , we have a criminal justice system that makes you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty , that if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
it &apos;s not guilt ; it &apos;s wealth that affects outcomes .
and we seem to feel very calm .
fear politics and anger make us believe that these are not problems with us .
we &apos;re disconnected .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
we &apos;re looking at some pretty curious developments .
in my state , in alabama , just like in other states , you will be struck by rights always if you have a criminal conviction .
right now in alabama , 34 percent of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote .
and if we toss it to the next 10 years , the level of loss is going to be as high as it was before we hit the right law to vote .
we have this amazing silence .
i play children .
many of my clients are very young .
america is the only country in the world where 13 @-@ year @-@ olds die in prison .
we have in this country in jail for children , no possibility of ever getting out .
right now , we &apos;re in a process of some litigation .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in death row .
this issue of death row is interesting .
in a sense , we have <unk> to think that the final question is , do people deserve to die for the ultimate <unk> ?
a very sensitive question .
but you can think differently about how we are in our identity .
there &apos;s another way of looking at it : it &apos;s not about deciding whether people should die for their crimes saved , but if we deserve to kill .
this is interesting .
death penalty in america is defined by mistake .
of every nine people who have drunk , they have identified one that is innocent that it &apos;s <unk> and released from the death row .
a bug rate , astonishing -- an innocent rate of every nine .
this is interesting .
in aviation , you would never be able to never afford any planes if every nine you would notice , you would have <unk> .
but somehow we get sick about the problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these things .
i talk about race and this business of trying to kill .
it &apos;s interesting that in my classes with african american @-@ american students , i talk to them about slavery .
i talk to you about terrorism , which started at the end of the reconstruction and lasted to world war ii .
we really don &apos;t know much about this .
but for black americans in this country , it was a seminal time defined by terror .
in many communities , people were afraid of being <unk> .
they were worried to be distracted .
the terror threat is what defined their lives .
now , there are older people who come up to me and say , &quot; mr. strickland , you teach me lectures . tell people to stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism for the first time , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they ask me to say , &quot; no . say we grew up with that . &quot;
the age of terrorism went on , obviously , with <unk> and decades of rape and separation .
in this country , we have a dynamic where we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we haven &apos;t really understood what we &apos;ve done historically .
all the time it takes for each other .
we constantly create tensions and conflicts .
it costs us to talk about races . i think it &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to engage us with a real and reconciliation process .
in south africa , people understood that you couldn &apos;t overcome race <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
in rwanda , even before the genocide , they had this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t .
i was in germany giving talks about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s kind of disturbing to hear what you say . &quot;
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have a death row in germany .
of course , we will never be here . &quot;
the room was silent , and a lady said , &quot; there &apos;s no way for our story , we can never get into the systematic death of human beings .
it would be irrational that we , intentional and <unk> , we were going to run people . &quot;
tell us about this .
how would we feel in a world where a nation like germany , <unk> people , especially if they were in their jews ?
we couldn &apos;t tolerate it .
it would be irrational .
and yet , in this country , in the former western states , we keep running people . in the same areas where 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white , which is 22 times more likely to be if the <unk> is black , and its <unk> is white . in the same state that they &apos;re buried .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
i think our identity is in danger .
if we don &apos;t really care about these issues that are so difficult , the positive and wonderful things are , however , evolved .
we love innovation .
we &apos;re fascinated with technology . we worship creativity .
we love entertainment .
but lately , those are well @-@ understood by the suffering , the abuse , the degradation , the <unk> .
in my opinion , we need to integrate both .
we &apos;re talking about the need to have more hope , more commitment , more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world .
i think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor , the <unk> , the ones that never get to ted .
thinking about them is , in a way , something that is within us .
it &apos;s true that we have to believe in issues that we haven &apos;t seen .
so we are . despite being so rational , so committed to intellectual .
with innovation , with creativity . development comes not just from brain ideas .
these things come from <unk> ideas also for their heart convictions .
this connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look not only in the shining and , but also in the dark and the difficult .
<unk> <unk> , the great sufi leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe , suffering from oppression , we wanted all sorts of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , guidance for the spirit , a willingness to be in sites of despair and be witnessed . &quot;
well , that alignment for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what i believe , that even in communities like ted , has to engage us .
there &apos;s no disconnect related to technology and design , which allows us to be truly human if we don &apos;t pay attention to poverty , to <unk> , to inequality , to injustice .
now i want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we neglect these things .
we come back to them .
i had the great privilege , being a very young lawyer , to meet <unk> <unk> .
she &apos;d come to empathize with some frequency , to come up with two of her closest friends , some older ladies , <unk> <unk> who had organized the bus <unk> , a wonderful lady , and virginia <unk> , a white lady , whose husband , <unk> , was dr. king &apos;s lawyer .
these women were just getting together to talk .
occasionally , the madame <unk> would call me , &quot; <unk> , the <unk> lady comes in . we &apos;re going to get together to speak .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; yes . yes i want . &quot;
so she said , &quot; well , what are you going to do when you come ? &quot;
i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so , i went and i just listened to them .
it was very <unk> , very <unk> .
and on one occasion , i was there , listening to these ladies , and after a couple of hours , mrs. <unk> turned to me and said , &quot; now , <unk> , that &apos;s that idea of fairness .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and i started giving him my speech .
i said , &quot; well , we &apos;re trying to question injustice .
we try to help those who have been convicted .
we try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration .
we try to end up with life sentences , without freedom from children .
we try to do something about death penalty .
we try to reduce the population in jail .
we try to finish the massive <unk> . &quot;
i gave him all my best speech , and he finally looked at me and he said , &quot; hmm . &quot;
and he said , &quot; let &apos;s march off . &quot;
at that time , ms. dewey <unk> , he put my finger in the face , and he said , &quot; that &apos;s why you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
i think that actually , the ted community has to be much more structured .
we have to find a way to deal with these challenges , those problems , that suffering .
because finally , humanity depends on compassion for others .
i &apos;ve learned some very simple things in my work .
i &apos;ve been doing simple things .
i &apos;ve come to understand and believe that every one of us is above the worst we have ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
i believe that if someone says a lie , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s a liar .
i &apos;m sure if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to it , it &apos;s not a thief .
even if someone kills another , it &apos;s not a killer .
so i think there &apos;s a basic dignity in people who have to be <unk> by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country and , surely , many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
that &apos;s not it .
i really think , in many parts , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think it &apos;s very dramatic , very beautiful , very <unk> , very encouraging , we don &apos;t get distracted by our technology , by our designs , not by our intellectual ability or rational ability .
ultimately , the character of a society is forged , not by the way they deal with the rich , powerful and privileged , but by the way they deal with the poor , for the prisoners , for the prisoners .
because it &apos;s in this context as we start to understand truly deep topics about what we are .
sometimes i feel <unk> . i &apos;m going to end with a story .
sometimes i make too much force .
he &apos;s tired , like everyone .
sometimes those ideas go beyond my stories into a major way .
i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been trafficked with a lot of <unk> .
i go to jail and i see my 13 and 14 @-@ year @-@ old clients who have been honored to make them as adults as adults .
and i start thinking , how can it be ?
how can a judge turn someone into what &apos;s not ?
judge <unk> him as an adult , but i see a child .
one night very late , i was thinking , &quot; oh , god , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , it must have magical powers .
<unk> , <unk> , judge has magical powers .
you should ask for some of that .
as it was too late , i couldn &apos;t think properly , but i started working on a <unk> .
i had a 14 @-@ year @-@ old client , a little , poor , black .
i started working on the <unk> , with a <unk> who said , &quot; <unk> for my 14 @-@ year @-@ old black client to be treated like a 75 @-@ year @-@ old background , an executive from a corporation . &quot;
in the 1930s , i put out that there was <unk> behavior in the accusation , in police behavior and in the process .
there was a bold line about how in this country there is no ethics , but a lot of ethics .
the next morning , i woke up thinking , was that a dream , or was i really writing it ?
for my horror , not only had it been <unk> , but he had been sent to court .
it took about two months , and i had lost it .
and finally decided -- oh , god , i have to go to court for this stupid case .
i got in the car , and i felt really overwhelmed , overwhelmed .
i went in the car to the court .
i thought this would be very difficult and scary .
i finally got off the car . i was walking to the court .
i was going up the stairs when i encountered a big black man , and that was the court man .
when he saw me , he approached me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; is it you a lawyer ? &quot; i said yes .
so , i was shocked and moved .
and i was struck by the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
i have to tell you now that was rude .
that connected with my inner identity , with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope .
well , i went into the audience hall .
as he walked in , the judge saw me .
and he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you write this <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; mr. i was me , &quot; and we started discussing .
people started getting there . they were all <unk> .
i was the one who had written those crazy things .
the police came in , the <unk> , the <unk> .
suddenly , not knowing how , the room was full of people . they were all infuriated because we talked about races , because we talked about poverty , because we talked about inequality .
with the <unk> of my eye , i saw the <unk> that i was going and coming .
i would look out the window and hear all that conversation .
he was still walking over here and over .
finally , this old black man , with his face of concern , came into the room and sat behind me , almost at the table of lawyers .
about 10 minutes later , the judge was <unk> a <unk> .
during the break , an assistant at the <unk> showed up because the <unk> had gone into the room .
the assistant <unk> over the old black .
and he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the audience ? &quot;
and the old black man stood up , looked at the assistant , looked at me and said , &quot; i walked into this audience hall to tell this young man to keep his sight in the stand @-@ up . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted today , because i think a lot of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big , but it folds towards justice .
we cannot be truly human beings if we don &apos;t care about human rights and by dignity .
our survival is tied up with others .
that our visions of technology , design , entertainment and creativity have to <unk> and <unk> and justice .
and above all , those of you who share this , i just want to tell you that you &apos;re going to keep your eye on the side .
thank you very much .
you &apos;ve just heard and see an obvious desire from the audience , from this community , to help in their purposes , to do something .
something that &apos;s not a check . what can we do ?
there are several nearby opportunities .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there will be a tsunami in which this spring will become an effort to ensure that we &apos;re spending today in blame policy .
for example , here in california , you &apos;re going to spend a billion dollars on death row , in the next five years . a billion dollars .
and despite this , 46 percent of the cases of being arrested .
56 percent of rapes come to nothing .
here &apos;s a change opportunity .
this little guy is going to come up with his funds to get the law , to the security .
i think there &apos;s a very close opportunity .
there &apos;s been a huge decline in crime in america in the last three decades .
part of the explanation , it &apos;s said that it has to do with the biggest <unk> rate .
what would you say to those who believe it is ?
actually , the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable .
the big growth in mass science in this country is not for crimes of violence .
it &apos;s the wrong war with drugs .
that &apos;s why this dramatic increase in population emerge .
and we &apos;re allowed to convince the rhetoric of the punishment .
we have three legal causes to bring people to life in life , for stealing a bicycle , for small crimes of property , instead of making those resources into their victims .
i think we have to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less .
it seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn &apos;t do anything for anyone .
i think that &apos;s the guidance that has to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve been excited today .
you &apos;re so inspiring .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
<unk> : they grow threats to bin laden &apos;s death threats .
<unk> : <unk> in somalia .
<unk> : <unk> posters .
<unk> : social decline .
<unk> : mind @-@ blowing <unk> .
several <unk> : war for drug destruction . mass destruction .
recession .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh , my god !
these are just some of the clips i got in the last six months , and you could be just the last six days or the last six years .
the idea is that press media prefer negative news because our minds are paying attention to them .
and that answers to a very good reason .
in every second of each day , our senses are much more data than probably the brain can process .
and as nothing matters more to survive , the first stop that data is an ancient segment of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
the amygdala is our early warning detector , the danger detector .
it records and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us .
so , from a <unk> of stories , we looked at negative stories .
that old adage in the press , &quot; if there &apos;s blood , &quot; it &apos;s very true .
and because all digital devices provide us with negative news for the seven days of the week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not surprising to be pessimistic .
it &apos;s not surprising that people think the world &apos;s going from bad to worse .
but maybe it &apos;s not .
perhaps , instead , what happens is that we get <unk> .
perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades .
i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our good problems : climate change , species extinction , water scarcity and energy -- we certainly have them .
as human beings , we &apos;re very good at solving the problems and , in the long run , we just ended with them .
so let &apos;s look at what happened in the last century to see where we &apos;re going .
in the last hundred years , the average lifespan has more than doubled , the average per capita income for inflation has tripled in the world .
child mortality has reduced 10 times .
also , the cost of food , electricity , transportation and communications , has fallen 10 to 1,000 times .
steve pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful times in human history .
and charles kenny who &apos;s the global literacy , he went from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we &apos;re actually living an extraordinary time .
a lot of people forget it .
and we keep adding them higher and higher expectations .
in fact , we emphasize the meaning of poverty .
think about it , today in america , a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity , water , toilets , <unk> , cell phones , air conditioning and cars .
the rubber <unk> of the last century , the <unk> on the planet , would never have dreamed of such luxury .
supporting a lot of this is technology and , lately , its exponential growth .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve , moore &apos;s law , and double the price performance over 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the cell phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
it &apos;s moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
i want you to look at two things on this curve .
first , the soft thing -- in good , bad times , in war and in peace , in recession , in depression and booming .
it &apos;s the end of fast computers that we use to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t stop at all big challenges .
and even though he &apos;s hit on a left @-@ hand law , he gets to the top .
the growth rate of technology is actually getting faster and faster .
and on this curve , moore &apos;s law , there &apos;s an extraordinarily powerful series of technologies that we have today .
the computation in the cloud , which my friends from autodesk call infinite computation , sensors and networks , robotics , 3d printing and its capacity to democratize and personalized production throughout the planet , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccines and food , digital medicine , <unk> and artificial medicine .
i mean , how many of you saw the victory in &quot; jeopardy , &quot; from ibm ?
it was epic .
i looked in the newspapers , the best headline i had .
and i love this one : &quot; watson <unk> human opponents . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy &quot; is not an easy game .
play with the nuances of human language .
imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud , available for everyone in the cell .
four years ago , here at ted , ray kurzweil and i , launched a new university called <unk> university .
we teach these technologies to our students , and in particular , how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
and every year we have them release a company , or a product or service , which can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade .
think about that , the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people .
30 years ago , that would have been absurd .
today , we can point out a pipeline of companies that have already been done .
when i think about creating abundance , it doesn &apos;t mean creating life that is good for every single person on the planet -- it &apos;s about creating a life of the possible .
it &apos;s about taking that which is scarce and making it plentiful .
you see , the scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
it &apos;s a story of napoleon in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited dinner the king of <unk> .
maxwell &apos;s troops ate with money , and himself napoleon , with gold <unk> .
but the king of <unk> , he ate covered in aluminum .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet ; it was worth more than gold and platinum .
that &apos;s why the tip of the washington rescue is aluminum .
you see , although aluminum is <unk> percent of the mass of the earth , it doesn &apos;t come as pure metal .
it &apos;s tied up with oxygen and <unk> .
but then the <unk> came in and made it out of aluminum something as cheap as we use it as if it were <unk> .
it <unk> this analogy towards the future .
let &apos;s think of energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re on a planet , bathed 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
they come to earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minute .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , it &apos;s about affordability .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , the cost of solar energy in india is 50 percent less than the fuel produced : <unk> versus 17 .
the cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year .
last month , the mit published a study that shows that at the end of the decade , in the ottoman parts of the united states , the solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents a national average .
and if we have plenty of energy , we also have plenty of water .
let &apos;s talk about wars over water .
do you remember when carl sagan pointed the spacecraft at earth in 1990 , after saturn ?
he took a famous picture . what was he called ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet covered 70 percent by water .
yes , five percent is salt water , two percent is ice , and we fight for half percent of the water on the planet , but here &apos;s also a hope .
it &apos;s a technology that &apos;s available not 10 or 20 years , but right now .
nanotechnology comes with <unk> .
in a conversation with dean kamen this morning , one of the innovators in the <unk> -- i &apos;d like to share with you , he gave me permission to do this -- his technology called <unk> -- is already the size of a small refrigerator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water a day of any <unk> source , polluted water , a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon .
president of coca @-@ cola has just recently proven that it will do an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world .
if that comes out well , and i have a full confidence that this will be , coca @-@ cola , globally , globally , globally , globally , globally , globally .
this is a <unk> innovation by this technology that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen it in mobile phones .
my god , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013 .
think about it , that ephemeral warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of kenya than president reagan 25 years ago .
and , having a smartphone with google , it has access to more knowledge and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
he lives in a world of abundance of information and communication that no one could ever have predicted .
better than that , the things that you and i have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video , hd images , libraries of books and music , diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones .
maybe the best comes when the health care applications come .
last month , i had the pleasure of <unk> with the <unk> foundation -- something called the <unk> x prize , 10 million dollars .
we &apos;re challenging the equipment in the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that you &apos;re talking about , and since it has ai , you can get blood out of your finger .
to win , it has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team .
imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , where the <unk> load is 25 percent , and there are 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
when this device <unk> a rna or dna virus that doesn &apos;t recognize , it will be called the fda @-@ approved device and , in the first place , it will account for the pandemic .
but this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance .
i call it the billion increase .
the white lines over here are the population .
we just went through seven billion .
by the way , the best protection against the population explosion is to provide the education world .
in 2010 , we had less than two billion people online , connected .
by 2020 , it will happen two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion minds never before add up to the global conversation .
what do these people want ?
what do you want ? what wishes you want ?
and instead of economic collapse , we &apos;ll have the greatest economic injection of history .
these people represent tens of billions of dollars living in the global economy .
and most health care <unk> , from a better education with the khan and because of the use of 3d impressions and cloud computation will be more productive than ever before .
what can we provide 3,000 million more members of humanity , healthy , productive ?
how about voices never before ?
what if we give them to the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time ?
what are these three billion ?
what if they &apos;re contributions we cannot predict ?
something that i learned with the x prize is that small teams , led by their passion with a clear purpose , can do extraordinary things , things that could only do the big , corporations and governments .
i &apos;m going to end sharing a story that really got me excited .
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
it &apos;s called foldit .
it came up at the university of washington , in seattle .
it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein behaves .
the folds determine the structure and the functionality .
it &apos;s very important in medical research .
and , until now , it was a huge problem of supercomputers .
they &apos;ve played with this college professors , among others .
then hundreds of thousands of people went in and they started playing it .
and it &apos;s been shown today that the human @-@ pattern recognition machinery is better protein than the best computers .
and these people looked at the best protein <unk> in the world , and they didn &apos;t teach at mit , and i was not teaching at caltech ; it was a person in england , in manchester , a woman who , during the day , was a ceo at a rehabilitation clinic and , at night , was the best protein <unk> of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in the future is that we now have more power as people to assume the great challenge of the planet .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
we have the passion of <unk> .
we have <unk> capital .
and we have 3,000 billion new minds that are focused on working on the solution of big challenges and doing what we should do .
we have for quite extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change .
and i think this starts with a doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and i &apos;ve spent enough time on my fake prestige about that .
before i try my talk , let &apos;s talk a little bit about baseball .
why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , the world heritage approach .
we love baseball , right ?
now , baseball is full of amazing statistics .
there are hundreds of statistics .
it &apos;s about to go out &quot; <unk> the rules &quot; -- speaks about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team .
i get into one of them , and i hope a lot of you know .
it &apos;s called the average <unk> .
and we talk about 300 , 300 light bulbs that we see , 300 .
that means that <unk> effectively , three out of 10 times .
that means throwing the ball into the playing field without being caught , and anyone who tries to throw it out at the very first base , doesn &apos;t get there in time , and the second base will be <unk> .
three attempts at 10 .
you know how they call a 300 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> ?
well , really good , maybe of the team of stars .
you know what they call a 400 @-@ year @-@ old baseball switch ?
by the way , that &apos;s someone who , 10 taps , gets it all four .
legendary -- like the leading ted williams , the last <unk> division i was at running over 400 taps into a regular season .
now , i &apos;m going to link this to my world of medicine where i feel much more comfortable , or maybe less uncomfortable , after what i &apos;m going to tell you today .
suppose you have <unk> and you &apos;re hardwired to a surgeon who also has a four @-@ year record on it .
so it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
now suppose you live in a remote place , and a loved one has two coronary arteries , and your family doctor is heading to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 .
but , you know something ?
she &apos;s dramatically improving this year .
and their farms have been <unk> .
this is not working .
but i &apos;m telling you .
what do you think it should be the average <unk> of a heart surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon , of a nurse or a thousand , very well .
and the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows about a good surgeon , a doctor or a <unk> .
what we do , though , is we <unk> the world , and i include myself , with the mandate of being perfect .
never , ever , ever mind a mistake and trying to figure out how to do it well .
that was the message that i was born when i was in medical college .
i was a obsessive student .
once , a high school companion said brian goldman sachs to a blood test .
just like that .
i studied in my little <unk> , in the nursing homes at general university of toronto , not far from here .
and i learned everything from memory .
from my kind of anatomy , i <unk> the origin and the work of muscle , the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the aorta , the common diagnosis and the usual .
and i even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify kidney <unk> .
and as long as we gather more and more knowledge .
and i went very well ; i graduated with <unk> .
and he <unk> from medical school with the impression that if he knew everything , then he would know everything , or as close as he could , close to everything , because that &apos;s how i got mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met the madame <unk> lady .
i was a resident at a university hospital here , in toronto , when they brought the lady in the emergency service where i was working .
at the time , i was welcomed in cardiology .
and when i &apos;m borrowing from a cardiologist , i was able to attend that patient .
and it inform the boss of residents .
when i saw the madame <unk> , i was angry .
i heard a ringing sound .
and when i rescued it , i heard a sound <unk> on both sides , which indicate to me heart failure .
in these conditions , the heart stops working , and instead of injecting the blood forward , the blood goes into the lungs , they fill out the blood , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s hard to breathe .
and it wasn &apos;t hard to diagnose .
i did , and i started working on the treatment i would give .
i gave him aspirin and medication to address the pressure in his heart .
i gave him <unk> , water pills , so he could remove a liquid .
and on one hour or two , she started feeling better .
and i felt really good .
and that &apos;s when i made the first mistake , i sent her home .
i actually made two more mistakes .
i sent her home without talking to her boss .
i didn &apos;t get up the phone , and i didn &apos;t do what i should have done , which was call my boss , and i was calling my boss to see it .
and if my boss would have seen it , it would have been able to do good data .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a conductor who was running along the way .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibilities , that i could take care of my patients without even reaching my boss .
the second mistake i made was worse .
when i send him to his house , he didn &apos;t pay attention to a voice in my inner world that said , &quot; goldman sachs , it &apos;s not a good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i was so insecure that i even asked the nurse to take care of the grandmother , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if it &apos;s going home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought , and then she said , &quot; yes , i think it &apos;s okay . &quot;
i remember that as it was yesterday .
so , i signed the high , and the ambulance next to the <unk> drove her home .
and i went back to the hospital room .
the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had a bad <unk> in the stomach .
but i went on to my job .
at the end of the day , i walked up to leave the hospital , and i walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home . at that time i did something i don &apos;t normally do .
i went through the guidance service at home .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not the one who was taking care of the lady before , but another . she told me three words , those three words that most emergency physicians fear .
other specialists who are also afraid , but there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> , and that is that we see patients <unk> .
the three words are : does it remember you ?
&quot; does it remember the patient who sent home ? &quot;
he asked the other full nurse .
&quot; well , she came back , &quot; with the same voice tone .
she was fine .
but he went back and on the brink of death .
after an hour of having arrived at his house , after i gave him high , he suffered a collapse and his family called 911 , and the ambulance brought him to a 50 @-@ millimeter blood pressure , which means severe shock .
i was barely breathing , and i was blue .
emergency staff will save all their resources .
they gave him medication to raise blood pressure .
and they had an artificial <unk> .
i was <unk> and <unk> to the marrow .
he had a mix of feelings , because after he got it , he was in intensive care , and he hoped against all the hope he would get tired .
and in the two or three days , it was apparent that i never will .
he had an injured brain damage .
the family got together .
and in eight to nine days , he was facing what was happening .
and at the ninth day , they let her go . the madame <unk> woman , wife and grandmother .
they say they never forget the names of those who die .
that was my first experience .
the next few weeks , i was embarrassed by that , and i experienced this for the very first time by the shame that exists in our medical culture , and i felt just isolated , without feeling that healthy embarrassment because you can &apos;t relate to your colleagues .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a secret friend of mine , you know , you discover it . so your friend faces it and you have a terrible discussion , but at the end of that nasty sense , it &apos;s his connection , and you can admit that he never <unk> that error .
you make peace and you never make that mistake .
it &apos;s that shame that leaves a teaching .
the shame of what i &apos;m talking about is what makes us feel very bad inside .
it &apos;s the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong , but we &apos;re bad .
and that felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for my boss ; he was a <unk> .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he <unk> things and <unk> that i don &apos;t get tired .
and i kept getting those questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask my boss ? why did i send her home ?
and in my worst moments , why did i make such a dumb mistake ?
why did i choose medicine ?
soon that feeling was unstoppable .
and i started feeling better .
and on a rainy day , the sky opened , and finally the sun came out . and i wondered if i felt better again .
and i did a deal with myself in which , if i simplify the efforts to be perfect in order not to make more mistakes , i would cheat those voices .
and so it was .
i went back to work .
but it again happens .
two years later , i was an assistant at the emergency department in a community hospital in northern toronto , and i got a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man with a pain in her throat .
i was very busy .
and he &apos;s here .
i watched his throat , he was kind of angry .
he <unk> penicillin and i sent him home .
but while he was at the door , he was still pointing his throat .
two days later , when i came to do my police change , my boss asked me to talk to me about his office .
and he made the three words : does it remember you ?
do you remember the patient who looked at the pain of her throat ?
so he went back and he didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
he had a potentially fatal condition called <unk> .
you can search for google . it &apos;s an infection , not the throat , but the front air force , and it can cause the closing of those roads .
he , fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he <unk> antibiotics in a while , and he recovered at the very few days .
and i stepped back from the same period of shame and <unk> , then moved back and forth to work , until it happened again and again , and again .
twice at the same emergency rate , no <unk> .
and it &apos;s a great effort , especially working in a hospital , because it &apos;s 14 patients at the same time .
but in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s been a <unk> .
one of them thought i had a kidney calculated .
he <unk> an x @-@ ray of kidneys , but it turned out to be a colleague that was looking at the patient , looking at some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant and called the surgeon .
the other patient was with a lot of diarrhea .
i <unk> her liquid for <unk> , and i asked my colleague to fix it .
he checked , and he noticed some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant , called the surgeon .
both of these were operated and they recovered well .
but every case i get tired , i get angry .
but i would like to tell you that i made the worst errors in the first five years of exercise , and as many colleagues say , it &apos;s a mess .
the most significant have been over the last five years .
only , shame and no support .
and here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t go back and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the <unk> that tells me what really happens , how can i share this with my colleagues ?
how do you teach them this so that they don &apos;t make the same mistakes ?
if i started a place now like this , i would have no idea what you think of .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure , after failure , after failure ?
of course , at a party , you &apos;ll hear about other medical errors , but you won &apos;t hear someone talk about their own mistakes .
if i now go into a room full of colleagues , if i asked them to support and tell them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would not reach the second story before they started screaming , someone would make a joke , they would change and they would follow .
and if i knew and my colleagues too , that a <unk> in my hospital would get the wrong leg , believe that i would have difficulty looking at her eyes .
this is the system that we have .
complete denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s the system in which there are two positions : those who make mistakes and those who cannot sleep , and those who do ; those who have lousy results and those who have great results .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like antibodies that starts to attack that person .
we have the idea that if we don &apos;t step back from medicine to people who make mistakes , we will stay in a safe system .
but that brings two problems .
in 20 years , approximately as a spread and medical journalism , i have done a study of <unk> health care and medical errors to learn how possible , from the very first article i wrote to toronto , &quot; star wars &quot; : white plains , art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous .
we work in a system where mistakes happen every single day , where one out of 10 drugs locked in the hospital is wrong , or <unk> is not right . in a system where hospital acquired infections are increasingly , and more numerous , causing chaos and death .
in this country , 24 / 7 dying of <unk> medical errors .
the u.s. medical institute set out 100,000 .
in both cases , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re not <unk> the problem as we should .
and so there are things .
a holistic system where knowledge exploded every two or three years , and we don &apos;t get distracted .
sleep deprivation is all <unk> .
and we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have cognitive biases that allow you to do a perfect history of a patient with chest pain .
now , let &apos;s take the same patient with a pain in the chest , it &apos;s kind of <unk> with eyes and with breath for alcohol and , all of a sudden , my story is <unk> .
it &apos;s not the same story .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things always .
and my patients are not cars . they &apos;re not always managing their symptoms in the same way .
all this stuff , mistakes are inevitable .
so , if we take the system as we were taught , and we eliminated all the stakeholders for error , well , no one will stay .
and with respect to people , they don &apos;t want to talk about their wildest cases ?
in my program , &quot; <unk> black , black art , &quot; now it &apos;s a custom saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; i would say everyone , from the <unk> to the head of cardiac surgery : &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah -- what are your mistakes ? &quot; and we <unk> the microphone into them .
and his students would be visibly , his pupils , <unk> his head and <unk> saliva and starting to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories , they want to share them .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake . &quot;
they need a context where they can do it .
they need a medical culture .
and he begins with a physician every time .
so , ms. doctor , is human , you know , human , you accept it , and you don &apos;t enjoy the mistakes , but you try to learn what &apos;s happened to teach others .
they share their experiences with them .
it &apos;s support for those who talk about their mistakes .
it points out the errors of other people , not with the intent of <unk> , but in a way that is a love and a support way that everyone is shocked .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system , and when this happens , they make mistakes rather than when .
but the system is evolving to create <unk> that will allow you to detect in a simple way those errors that inevitably make humans , and also promote support and love , spaces from where you see in the healthcare system , you can find potential errors and be rewarded for that ; especially people like me , so that we can make errors for profit .
my name is brian goldman sachs .
i &apos;m a grateful doctor .
i &apos;m human ; i make mistakes .
and i &apos;m so sorry , but i &apos;m hard to learn something that i can convey to others .
i don &apos;t know what they think about me yet , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three personal words : i remember it .
i &apos;m going to talk about a very small idea .
the <unk> of the starting point .
and as the idea can be explained in a minute , i &apos;ll give you three examples to make time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
he was here , as you know , in <unk> .
you probably think it &apos;s <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t .
he actually would pick fish .
and he described one of them as very common .
it was just pure .
they were sweating a lot to the 1880 decade .
now , the fish is in the red <unk> canyon .
but we &apos;ve heard this story a lot about galapagos and other places , so that &apos;s not special .
but the thing is , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re <unk> .
the <unk> still say it &apos;s intact .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
second story , it also illustrates another concept : the shifting of the waist .
because i was there in 1971 studying a <unk> in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe , and then i wanted to work in africa .
i thought it could be wrong .
i was very pleased with the sun , and i was convinced that i wasn &apos;t there .
this is my first exhibition to the sun .
the lagoon was surrounded by <unk> , and , as you can see , a few mangroves .
there were about 20 inches , black beard <unk> .
and the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and was <unk> for a good time , so it was much more than the average in ghana .
when i was there 27 years later , the number of fish had gone down to half .
he went to five inches .
they experienced genetic pressure .
there were still fish .
in a way , they were still happy .
and the fish were still happy to be there .
so , nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third story is that i was partner in the introduction of fishing in southeast asia .
in the 1970s , well , it started in europe &apos;s <unk> .
development <unk> was encouraging countries that had 100,000 fishermen already , including industrial fisheries .
and this boat , quite ugly , was called the <unk> 4 .
i went out and fishing in him , and we did studies in the south of the china sea , and above all , in the java sea .
what we captured there was something <unk> .
we capture , now i know , sea bottom .
90 percent of what we capture were , other animals that are in the background .
and most of the fishes are small blobs of these things , these things that are coral reefs .
in short , the bottom of the sea came on the deck and then it was <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary because transition is very fast .
in a year , you do a study , and then you start commercial fishing .
the background is about being a solid coral deep , soft coral in this case , to be a <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat them . they were <unk> because they were dead .
we once capture a living .
i was still not pregnant .
so they wanted to save them because it was a good food .
this mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they never have fish .
but it &apos;s not yet documented .
we turn the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
let &apos;s start the starting point , at the new level , without remembering what was there .
if you look at this , something like this .
on the y @-@ axis , we have good things : biodiversity , the number of killer whales , the <unk> of the country , the water supply .
and that changes over time . it changes because people do things with sadness .
each generation is trying to use images that are delivered in the beginning of their conscious life like normal and put it forward .
the difference is that they experience loss .
but they don &apos;t perceive the loss that happened before .
you can analyze the set of changes .
and in the end , it keeps some sort of miserable <unk> .
and that , largely , is what we want to do now .
we want to keep things that are no longer , or are not what they were .
but you should think that this problem actually affects people when societies kill animals without knowing what they &apos;ve done to a few generations later .
because , of course , an animal that &apos;s very abundant , before it goes extinct , is unusual .
you don &apos;t lose stuffed animals .
you lose small animals .
even if this doesn &apos;t feel like a big loss .
over time , we focus on big animals , and in a sea synonymous with big fish .
they become unusual because the <unk> .
over time , we have a few fish , but we think that &apos;s the starting point .
and the question is , why do we accept this ?
well , because we don &apos;t know it was different .
in fact , a lot of people , scientists , <unk> that was very different .
and they will do that because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they expect evidence to be .
for example , the anecdote that some of them show , as a captain and just looked at a lot of fish in this area can &apos;t be used or , typically , they don &apos;t use fishing scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so , we have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in civilized societies , because they don &apos;t rely on the sources of the past .
that &apos;s the huge piece of paper that can accomplish a marine protected area .
because with marine protected areas , we actually visualize the past .
so , we &apos;re mapping the past that people can &apos;t think of , because the starting point has gone down and is extremely low .
that &apos;s for the people who can see a protected ocean area and can benefit from vision that provides , which allows them to delete their starting point .
and what about the people who can &apos;t do it because they have no access , like the people in the midwest , for example ?
i think the arts and film can probably fill in the vacuum ; the simulation .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
a lot of time ago there were gray whales in chesapeake bay , 500 years ago .
and you may have noticed that the nuances and the <unk> are like &quot; avatar . &quot;
and if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were moved with the film -- let &apos;s talk about the history of <unk> , why would you paint with images ?
because it raises something that , in a sense , has lost .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is cameron , &quot; avatar , &quot; under the water .
thank you very much .
in the &apos; 80s , in the eastern germany , if you had a typewriter machine , you had to write to the government .
you had to register a piece of text for example , written with the machine .
and this so that the government could track the origin of the textbooks .
if they found a script with the wrong message , they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea .
in the west , we don &apos;t think that someone could do this , which is how much this would undermine freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our countries .
but today , in 2011 , if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer and prints a page , that page will end up having little yellow dots on every page that follows a pattern that makes you one and a printer .
that &apos;s happening today .
and nobody seems very strongly about this .
this is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us , citizens .
and it &apos;s one of the three main causes of problems in the network .
if we look at what happens in the online world , we can set up the attacks according to their attackers .
there are three major groups .
there are <unk> .
like mr. <unk> &apos;s city of <unk> , in ukraine .
the <unk> cell is very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use cyber weapons to make a lot of money , enormous amounts .
there are actually many , many , many , many , many , many @-@ million @-@ dollar @-@ all cases that make money out of their attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> , of estonia , estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
this is stephen watt .
this is <unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> al @-@ <unk> and so on and so forth .
these guys are doing their <unk> online , but they &apos;re doing it for illegal media , using <unk> banks to steal money from our bills when we shop online , or steal our key to get information from our boards when we buy a computer infected computer .
the secret service of america , two months ago , <unk> the swiss account of this man , sam jain , and this bill had <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain , he says , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and i say that today is more likely than any of us to be a victim of a real crime .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this goes from bad to worse .
in the future , most crimes will come online .
the second group of much against the importance that we observe today is not driven by the money .
there &apos;s another thing that moves them , they motivate their protests , they motivate their opinions , they motivate them all the laughter .
groups like <unk> have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a leading role in online attacks .
those are the three leading attackers : the criminals who do it for money , the <unk> as <unk> , who make it for granted , and the last group are national states that attack .
and then we see cases like <unk> .
that &apos;s a good example of government attack against its own citizens .
<unk> is an authority of the netherlands , or indeed , it was .
he declared the last fall because of a <unk> .
he <unk> the safety of the site and <unk> a <unk> .
last week , i asked , at a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders if they created the death of people because of the attack <unk> .
and the answer to him was yes .
so , how do people die of a attack of these ?
<unk> is an illegitimate authority .
they sell a certificate .
what do they serve for ?
well , you need , if you have a website with <unk> , services like <unk> , services like switch @-@ off .
now all of us , or almost all of us , use gmail or some of their competitors , but these services are very popular in biomedical states like iran in which dissidents , using foreign services like gmail , because they know that they are more reliable than local services , and they are <unk> in connections so that local government cannot sneak up their discussions .
except that you have a foreign authority .
and he <unk> <unk> .
and in the case of <unk> , that &apos;s exactly what happened .
and what happened in the arab spring and those things that have happened , for example , in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the protesters documented the headquarters for the egyptian police in april , 2011 , and during the <unk> of the building , they found a lot of papers .
amongst those papers was this folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and inside that folder , there were notes from a company based in germany that had sold the egyptian government , egyptian tools to intercept the great scale of the communications of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company &apos;s headquarters are right here .
so , western governments provide tools for governments to make this happen to their citizens .
but western governments also do this themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , the <unk> <unk> was found -- a <unk> used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a good criminal case , it &apos;s quite obvious that your phone is <unk> .
but today it goes further .
the internet connection is internet connection .
they use even tools like <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication , and listen to online arguments , to get our data .
when we think about things like this , the obvious answer should be , &quot; well , it sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m an honest citizen .
why worry ?
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s in the game of privacy .
privacy is not arguing .
it &apos;s not a question of privacy versus safety .
it &apos;s about freedom versus control .
well , if we could rely on our governments today in 2011 , any right that we will use today will forever .
in any future government , in an administration that we could have within 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to worry about in the next 50 years .
this may seem strange , but i &apos;m a huge <unk> of the concrete block .
the first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea : cement modules of a fixed circle that fit together .
very quickly , these became the most widely used construction unit in the world .
they &apos;ve allowed us to build bigger things that we , like buildings or bridges , a brick at a time .
essentially , these blocks have become the building blocks of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , to <unk> , this happened .
he was called an automatic assembly .
and within a few years , all the aid blocks arrived at all the homes .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges , buildings or homes .
lego made it accessible .
lego just took off the concrete block , the majority in the world , and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination .
meanwhile , exactly that same year , in the bell labs , the next big revolution was about to say , the new building block .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us out of a world of bricks @-@ like bricks @-@ and @-@ a @-@ bit about a world where everything was interactive .
just like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to create much bigger , more complex , brick at once .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building blocks of our time are reserved experts , so i decided to change it .
eight years ago , when i was in the media lab , i started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
i &apos;m going to show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function .
they &apos;re wired to be light , sound , engines and sensors .
and the best part of it is that they unite through magnets .
so you can &apos;t get it wrong .
the bricks have a code of colors .
the green is the output , the blue is the stream , the rose , and the orange one is the wire .
so you only have to assemble a blue one with a green one and very quickly start to make major circuits .
a green one with a green one produces light .
we can put a button in the middle , and so we &apos;ve got a regulator .
if we change the button for a pulse module , which is here , and now we have a light bulb .
we add this <unk> to create more impact , and we have a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop this .
so beyond the simple game , <unk> is actually very powerful .
instead of having to program , connect and self @-@ programming , it allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
to make you blink faster or slower , you simply turn this button over which makes your pulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing collection .
we want all the interactions in the world to come up with bricks that are ready to use .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors ; everything has to be accessible .
we &apos;ve given kids to watch them play with them .
and it &apos;s been an amazing experience .
the cool thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics of every day you don &apos;t learn in schools .
for example , how does a light at night , or why the dog &apos;s door is kept open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also taken <unk> to design schools .
so , for example , designers without any experience in electronics begin playing games like a material .
here you can see , with paper bottles and <unk> , we have <unk> , creating ...
a few weeks ago , we took care of the designers at rhode island school of design , which have no experience in engineering , <unk> in cardboard , wood and <unk> , and we said , &quot; do something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they &apos;ve done , a cannon , run by motion .
but wait , here comes my favorite project .
it &apos;s a locust made of play @-@ dough that is very afraid of the dark .
for these non @-@ engineers , <unk> became another material , electronics became another material .
and we want this material to be aware of everyone .
so , <unk> has open source .
you can visit the website , download all the design files and throw it away .
we want to encourage a world of creators , inventors and collaborators , because this world we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so go ahead and invent .
thank you .
