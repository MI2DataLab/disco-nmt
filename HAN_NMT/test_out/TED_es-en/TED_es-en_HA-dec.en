one day , the guardian times <unk> was walking down the streets of los angeles , when he heard a beautiful music .
he came from a man , a lovely , <unk> man , hard face , no home , playing a violin that only had two strings .
i &apos;m telling you a story that a lot of you know , because steven <unk> &apos;s column was the basis for a book that then became a film , with robert <unk> , performing like steve <unk> and jamie <unk> , like nathaniel <unk> , who was trained in <unk> whose promising race was <unk> by a tragic <unk> of schizophrenia .
nathaniel <unk> , he suffered a complete and 30 years later he was living on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles .
i encourage you to read steve or look at the movie to understand not only the beautiful link that was created between these two guys , but how music helped to shape that link , and finally played a useful role to help nathaniel out the streets .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
he just heard an interpretation of the first and fourth symphony of beethoven and came behind the stage to show .
he spoke a very <unk> and social way about me @-@ yo ma and hillary clinton and how the palace never would go to the world series , all because of the performance of the first violin line in the last game by beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
and we talk about music , and a few days later , i got an electronic mail saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , i have to mention that nathaniel denies the treatment , because when he was treated by <unk> therapy , <unk> and wives , and that scar has remained in his entire life .
but as a result right now , it &apos;s prone to these schizophrenics , and the worst <unk> can be measured by him exploding and then disappearing for days , <unk> by the streets of skid row , exposed to his <unk> , with the <unk> of his own mind without control .
and nathaniel was in such a state of turmoil when we started our first lesson in the walt disney hall who had a kind of flash <unk> in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible <unk> and smoke , and how someone was sleeping it .
and i felt fear , not for me , but fear that i was going to lose it , that i was going to sink in one of their states and that i would challenge their relationship to the violin if i started talking about scale and develop and other ways of pedagogy <unk> for the violin .
so i just started playing .
and i was playing the first move for beethoven &apos;s violin .
and as i learned that a profound change was happening in nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if i was under control of some unseen drug , a chemical reaction , for which i played music was its catalyst .
and cholera that was transformed into understanding , into a sit curiosity and in grace .
and as a miracle , he raised his own violin , and he began to touch some clips of concerts for a violin , which then asked me to go ahead and shave , relax .
and we started talking about music , from bach all the way to beethoven and brahms , <unk> , all the <unk> , all the way down to that guy @-@ <unk> .
and i understood that he didn &apos;t only have a <unk> of music , but he would marry this music at a personal level .
he talked about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man transformed from the paranoid man , who had come from walking the streets of the center of los angeles to the very charming scholar , brilliant , who was in <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and his delusions and turn through his imagination and his creativity actually .
and this is an escape from his <unk> state .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the real reason why we make music , that we take something that exists inside all of us , in our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we are able to transform those emotions actually .
and the reality of that expression sets us all , it moves us , it inspires us and it binds us .
and for nathaniel , the music brought him back to the group of friends .
the <unk> power of music came back to the family of musicians who understood it , who recognized their talents and spread it .
and i will always make music with nathaniel , whether we &apos;re in the walt disney hall , or on skid row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert knight , robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that without some embarrassment of the <unk> .
so please excuse me .
so i &apos;ve met a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve only loved two .
the first was more like a passionate romance .
it was a beautiful , tasty fish , with texture , <unk> , a <unk> in the menu .
fish .
even better , it was brought up with the highest <unk> of sustainability .
so you could feel good at selling .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , he called the chief of the company , and he asked if i would talk at an event about sustainability <unk> .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
so , here was a company trying to solve this problem for our chefs that had been <unk> inside , like we kept fish in our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we were fishing in the shallow seas in the same way as harvesting our forests .
it &apos;s hard to get rid of destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the salmon , the swordfish , all collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for good or for bad , <unk> , fish parenting , will be part of our future .
there are a lot of rules against it . fish <unk> , at least most of them do , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take the example of tuna .
it has a 15 @-@ to @-@ one food rate .
this means you need 15 pounds of wild fish to ship a kilogram of <unk> .
it &apos;s not very sustainable .
it &apos;s not very tasty either .
so here , finally , there was a company trying to do the right thing .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the pr superintendent of the company .
don <unk> .
&quot; gift , &quot; i said , &quot; only to have the facts in clear , you are famous for raising so far seas inside , which don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
he said , &quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far , that the waste of our fish is distributed , they don &apos;t concentrate . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world in itself .
that food intensity ? 2.5 to one , &quot; said .
&quot; the best at <unk> . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what are these feeding them ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> proteins , &quot; he told me .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . and we &apos;ll fix the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , right before the event , i called it <unk> .
i said , &quot; sir , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he told me he didn &apos;t know . i &apos;d say over there .
well , i spoke on the phone with some people in the company . nobody could give me a direct answer , until i finally spoke on the phone with the <unk> in charge .
let &apos;s call it &quot; don <unk> . &quot;
&quot; gift , &quot; i said , &quot; what are these examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some food for fish , and then he said chicken <unk> .
i said , &quot; chicken wings ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone , remains , <unk> and processed in food . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of the food is chicken ? &quot;
you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you have sustainable <unk> to feed the fish ? &quot;
there was a long silence in the line , and he said , &quot; that &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i got rid of this fish .
no , not because it &apos;s some gourmet <unk> <unk> .
i really am .
no , i really struggled with this fish , because , i swear to god , that after that conversation , the fish had a taste of chicken .
the second fish , is another kind of love story .
the romantic guy , the guy you know the fish , the more you love the fish .
i ate it for the first time in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine was talking about this fish for a long time .
somehow she organized our first quote .
he came to the table of a white color , of course , and almost <unk> .
the chef had a lot of cooking .
type two times more .
incredibly , it was delicious .
can you make a fish the same as rich after being so <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
call him michelangelo . actually his name is <unk> michelangelo .
and no , he doesn &apos;t eat the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way we understand it and i .
it &apos;s a biologist running the palm .
it &apos;s a fish <unk> on the <unk> @-@ west edge of spain .
it &apos;s at the end of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , the <unk> was in the <unk> &apos;s hands .
it also <unk> cows in what they were essentially <unk> .
they managed to <unk> the ground .
they built this <unk> series of canals , and crossed the water into the ground into the river .
well , they didn &apos;t make it work , they didn &apos;t do it in any economic way .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed something like 90 percent of the birds , which for a place like this , are many birds .
and then in 1982 , a spanish company with an environmental awareness company bought the ground .
what did they do ?
they invested the flow of water .
it literally <unk> the switch .
instead of pushing water out , used the canals to attract the water into .
we channel channels .
they created a <unk> of pack @-@ acre fish -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and in the process , michelangelo and his company <unk> the whole ecological destruction .
<unk> is amazing .
i mean , they never saw something like this .
you look at the horizon that &apos;s at a million miles away , and what you see is that it &apos;s <unk> channels and this <unk> and rich swamp .
i was there a lot of time with michelangelo .
it &apos;s an amazing guy , three charles darwin and a <unk> crocodile .
ok ? so , there we are <unk> from the swamp , and i &apos;m <unk> and <unk> with clay on my knees , and michelangelo is doing with a slow conference from biology .
here &apos;s a black <unk> <unk> <unk> .
now , there is a quote about the minerals of <unk> .
and here , here he is looking at a pattern of clustering that makes him remember the <unk> of tanzania .
turns out , michelangelo spent most of his career in <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became an expert in fish .
he said , &quot; <unk> ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then it starts talking again about strange birds and algae and strange plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community out of that sort of thing .
it &apos;s fantastic , but i was in love .
and my head was bathed in that piece of delicious fish .
so i <unk> it . i said , &quot; michelangelo , that makes your fish so tasty ? &quot;
he showed me the algae .
&quot; i know , <unk> , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it &apos;s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what is the food conversion index ? &quot;
well , it starts to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system , that fish are eating what they would eat in their natural <unk> .
the biomass of plants , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , is what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s fully self @-@ renewable .
there &apos;s no food .
have you heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
later on that day , i was driving with michelangelo around a property , and i asked him , &quot; i said , &quot; to a place that looks so natural , &quot; different to any <unk> i &apos;ve been visited , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that time , it was as if a movie director asked to change the stage .
and by bending in the corner , we saw the most incredible landscape , thousands and thousands of pink <unk> , literally a pink carpet .
&quot; that &apos;s successful , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at his <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re doing a <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , you &apos;re not doing a <unk> with your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he told me .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds . <unk>
well , last year , this property had 600,000 more than 250 different species .
it became the largest one today , and one of the most important <unk> of birds across europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; michelangelo , a population of thriving birds is not the last thing you &apos;d like to have in your <unk> of fish ? &quot;
he moved his head , &quot; no . &quot;
he said , &quot; we grew up in a hurry , not intensive .
this is an ecological network .
shrimp are eaten by shrimp .
shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the more pink you have the belly , the better the system . &quot;
well , <unk> . a <unk> that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , and a <unk> that measures their success in the health of their predators .
a fish <unk> , but also a bird sanctuary .
oh , and by the way , those <unk> , first of all , shouldn &apos;t be there .
<unk> in a village that remains to 1,500 miles in which the ground conditions are better at making nests .
every morning , they fly 150 miles up to <unk> .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they get the white <unk> line on the highway .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i was imagining a guy who was flying from penguins , so i looked at michelangelo .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , fly 150 miles up to <unk> , and then they fly 150 miles back to night ?
do you understand that for your pups ? &quot;
he looked at me as though he had just quoted a song from houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t even like the fish skin . i don &apos;t like to eat it . i don &apos;t like to bathe .
that &apos;s <unk> taste , like tar .
i almost never use it for cooking .
however , when i tried it in that restaurant in southern spain , i had nothing to do with fish skin .
i had a sweet , clean taste like you were eating a <unk> of the ocean .
i mentioned that to michelangelo and <unk> with his head .
he said , &quot; <unk> skin like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something between the body .
it evolved to absorb <unk> . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water does not have any <unk> . &quot;
ok . a <unk> that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a <unk> that measures their success by their predators .
and then i realized when he says , a <unk> that has no <unk> , made a huge understatement , because the water flowing through that <unk> comes from the <unk> river .
it &apos;s a river that <unk> all the things that rivers tend to drag today , chemical pollutants , <unk> them .
and when you &apos;re entering the system and you go , the water is cleaner than when you entered .
the system is so healthy that it <unk> water .
so , not only does a <unk> that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a <unk> that measures their success for their predators , but a <unk> that is literally a water <unk> plant , and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should also take it , because this love story , although romantic , is also educational .
you might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of food , which we &apos;re talking about <unk> or beef .
what we need now is a radically different conception of agriculture , in which food is actually tasty .
but for a lot of people , that &apos;s too radical .
we are not realistic ; we are lovers .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love small family farms . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and when it suggests that these are the things that <unk> the future of good food , someone else will say , &quot; hey , <unk> , i love pink <unk> , but you &apos;re going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we &apos;re producing calories anymore to feed the world .
one billion people will be hungry today .
one billion is more than ever before in history -- because of big inequities in the distribution , not <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it has determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feeding grain to the herbivores , crop pesticides , chemicals on the ground , chicken for the fish , and all the way around , the <unk> has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people in a much cheaper way , how terrible it can be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been motivation . it &apos;s been <unk> . it &apos;s been the business plan for american agriculture .
we should call it what really is , a business in <unk> , a business that is rapidly <unk> the ecological capital that makes its own production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and that &apos;s not agriculture .
our bread basket is being threatened today , not by a decrease of supplies , but by a decrease in resources .
not for the last invention of tractors , but for the fertile soil , not for bombs , but for fresh water , not for <unk> , but by forest , not for ships and fishing nets , but by fish in the sea .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better . how can we create conditions that allow each community to be feeding for itself ?
to do this , don &apos;t look at the <unk> model for the future .
it &apos;s really old and exhausted .
it &apos;s <unk> in capital , chemistry , and machinery , and it &apos;s never really rich to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s the two billion years of real work experience .
look at michelangelo , farmers like michelangelo .
they &apos;re saying that they &apos;re not a world that is locked away from themselves , that they are meant that they &apos;re growing up instead of just hard , farmers who are not just producers , but expertise in relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are also taste experts .
and i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re better chef than i will never be .
you know , i have no problem with that , because if that &apos;s the future of food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i can leave you this day with a single big idea , is that the data cluster we consume is bigger than the sum of the parts , and instead of looking at it as an information overload , what i want you to think of is how we can use that information to <unk> patterns and see trends in some way that &apos;s invisible .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sheet of mortality organized by age .
this tool i use is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and with <unk> what i can do is filter a particular cause of deaths , say accidents .
and immediately we see a different pattern .
this is because , in the central section here , people are their most active stage , and here they are in the most fragile .
we can go back and look at the data because of death , seeing that the debilitating disease and cancer are the usual suspects , even though not all .
if we take age , say age 40 , we see that accidents are really the main cause that people have to worry about .
and if you get more involved in that , it &apos;s more common in the case of men .
so , they understand the idea that seeing information and data in this way , is like swimming in a living data set .
and if we can do this with raw data , why don &apos;t we also do it for content ?
so what we have here , is the cover of all the <unk> that &apos;s been produced .
this is all over here . on the web .
they can go back to their rooms and try this after my talk .
with <unk> , they can reduce it to a decade .
or reduce it to a particular year .
or you can leap straight into a particular issue .
so i &apos;m looking at this , i see athletes that have appeared in this issue , sports .
i &apos;m a fan of lance armstrong , so i &apos;m going to click on that , which reveals me , all the <unk> in which this is lance .
now if you just want to take a look at this , you might think , &quot; what if we look at all the stuff that &apos;s related to cycling ? &quot;
so i can go back , and scale that up .
and now i see greg <unk> .
so you have an idea that when you measure information like this , <unk> , expanding , expanding , <unk> , you &apos;re not looking , you &apos;re not sailing .
they &apos;re doing something slightly different .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information takes .
so i want to transport this idea a little bit , which is a bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve taken all the pages of wikipedia , and we &apos;ve brought them down to a little summary .
the summary is a little <unk> , and an icon that indicates the area of <unk> that comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the 500 more popular pages of wikipedia .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we can have a sense of the most popular wikipedia <unk> .
i &apos;m going to force you to select government .
now , having selected government , i can see that the wikipedia categories that correspond to that are the time magazine of the year .
this is really important because this reveals something that was not content on any website .
you can only take that look when you step back and see everything .
so , looking at one of these particular examples , i can then drill down into the concept of time <unk> magazine , and look at them all .
so looking at these people , i can see that most of them come from government . some of them come from natural sciences . a few , they come from the world of businesses . there &apos;s my boss , and one of them comes from music .
and greater interest , bono is also a winner of the ted prize .
so we can jump in and take a look at all the ted prize winners .
as you can see , we &apos;re browsing the web for the first time as if it &apos;s really a network , not a page , but at a much larger level of abstraction .
i want to show you one more thing i can probably do a little bit .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times <unk> .
and lo and behold , this tool -- i don &apos;t call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see pages with it -- and we bring the information technology close to every website like this .
i can go back , give a little push back to a specific section .
now , the reason why it &apos;s important is because , by the simple fact of looking at web pages like this , i can see my entire record of full self @-@ navigation records in the same way .
and i can go into what i &apos;ve done in specific periods of time .
here , in fact , the state of all the demonstration that i just gave .
and i can do a reproduction of some of the things that i saw this morning .
and , if i want to go back and see it all , i can go in and cut my history , maybe for the search history . here , i was doing a little bit of <unk> quest , looking for <unk> , over here in the live room .
and from here , i can go to the website and make you run again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that has a new purpose every time , and in every case it makes the sum bigger than the sum of its parts to the data .
so now , in this world , we think of data as a curse .
we talk about the information overload curse .
we talk about <unk> in data .
what if we turn this around and put our heads on the web , so instead of going one thing into the next thing , we would be attached to the habit of being able to go from so many things , and then being able to see patterns that they would otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being stuck in data , we can actually extract information .
and if , instead of just dealing with information , we can gather knowledge .
and if we have knowledge , then maybe we can find wisdom .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up with a science fiction diet .
in the institute , the bus to the school of an hour per day .
and i was always involved in a book , a science fiction book , which <unk> my mind to other worlds , and <unk> , an insatiable sense of curiosity that i had .
and , you know , curiosity also <unk> itself in the sense that it was always not in school , was in the forest , doing <unk> and taking &quot; samples , snakes and bugs , snakes , and <unk> , looking through them through the microscope .
you know , i was a real fan of science .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , to understand the limits of possibility .
and my love for science fiction was reflected in the world around me , all around me , at the end of the &apos; 60s , <unk> the moon , <unk> the deep oceans .
jacques cousteau came out with his incredible special <unk> where he taught us animals and places and a wonderful world that we could never have imagined before .
so , that sounded like the science fiction part .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i discovered that , because there were no video games or this computer saturation made by computer and all this media landscape , i had to create images in my head .
we all do them , as kids who have to read a book , through the description of the author , we put something on the movie screens of our heads .
so , my answer to this was to paint , draw aliens and their worlds , robots , space ships , all that stuff .
i was infinitely present in the mathematics class behind the notebook .
that was the creativity that had to come out somehow .
and an interesting thing happened , the jacques <unk> &apos;s show actually <unk> me about that there was a world that was laid out right here , on earth .
i could probably not go to an alien world on a spaceship some day . that seemed quite unlikely .
but that was a world that really could go , right here on earth , which was so alive and as exotic as anything you could have imagined by reading one of those books .
so , i decided i was going to turn myself into a diver at age 15 .
although the only problem about that was that i lived in a canadian <unk> , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let that leave me behind .
i gave her the can to my father until he finally discovered a kind of diving in buffalo , new york , just crossing the border that we lived in .
so , i <unk> myself in a swimming pool in the middle of winter in buffalo , new york .
and i didn &apos;t see an ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the last 40 years , i &apos;ve been about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 of them in submersibles .
and i have learned that that habitat from the deep ocean and even the least profound , are so rich from an incredible life that really exceeds the imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so open compared to our weak human imagination .
still today , i &apos;m still completely unaware of what i &apos;ve seen when i do these <unk> .
and my romance with the ocean continues , and just as strong as it was always .
although i chose a profession , as an adult , it was the conductor .
and it seemed to be the best way to reconcile those <unk> that i had to tell stories , with the willingness to create images .
and i was , as a child , constantly drawing comics and so forth .
so , making films was a way of putting images and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that we were telling were science fiction stories : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and with &quot; the <unk> , &quot; i put my love together to be underwater and diving , making films .
combining the two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; which actually did work to figure out a particular storytelling problem in the movie , which was to create a type of liquid water creature , so we adopted computer animation .
and it turned out to be the first surface characters made by computer that has never been done in a movie .
and even though the movie wasn &apos;t very profitable , pretty much no profits , no losses , i should say i witnessed something incredible , which was the audience , the world audience , was <unk> by this apparent magic .
it &apos;s like arthur clarke &apos;s law saying that any advanced technology can &apos;t be counted on the magic .
they saw something magic .
so that made me really depressed .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be adapted to <unk> art . &quot;
so , &quot; 2 terminator , &quot; my next movie , we took this much more <unk> .
working with <unk> , we created the liquid metal uncle in that movie . the <unk> was in case the effect would work .
and it worked . and we created magic again , and we had the same result of audience , although we took something more money out of it .
so , drawing a line across those two points of experience , we came to , this was going to be a new world , this was a whole new world of creativity for <unk> artists .
so , he believes a company with stan winston , my good friend stan , who is the primary <unk> and designer at <unk> of the moment , and we call it digital <unk> .
and the goal of the company was that you would have a leap over the fiber <unk> processes , etc . , and you would direct the digital production .
and we actually did , and we got a competitive advantage for a while .
we were left behind in the mid @-@ 1990s in creating and designing characters , for what the company had been founded .
so , i wrote this piece called , &quot; which avatar , &quot; which was proposed absolutely to drive the development of visual effects , effects done by computer , but beyond that , human @-@ powered characters created by computer , and the main characters would all be done by computer . and the world would be done by computer .
but the challenge was , and the company &apos;s challenge told me that we &apos;re not going to be able to do this for a while .
so , i rented it , and i made this other movie on a big ship that <unk> .
you know , i went and sold it to the studio like &quot; romeo and juliet : &quot; it &apos;s a ship . &quot; it &apos;s going to be a <unk> romance , an exciting film .
aside , what i wanted to do was to immerse myself in the true <unk> of the titanic .
and that &apos;s why i did the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the study didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go into the remains of <unk> . we &apos;re going to record it real . &quot;
we &apos;ll use it at the beginning of the movie .
it &apos;s going to be really important . it &apos;s going to be a big marketing hook . &quot;
and i spoke to them to fund an expedition .
it sounds crazy . but this goes backwards to that about their imagination in creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i was in a russian submersible that was two and a half miles underwater , looking at the actual titanic through a window .
not in a movie , not <unk> , really .
now , that made me fly to my mind .
and that took a lot of preparation , and we had to build cameras and lights and all that kind of stuff .
although , that made me realize how much of this dive , these profound <unk> seemed to be a space mission .
you know , it was pretty technical , and it required massive planning .
you get into the capsule , you go down through that dark , you get an environment where there is no rescue hope if you can &apos;t go back for yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like i &apos;m living a science fiction movie .
this is great . &quot;
so , i really enjoyed the exploration of the deep ocean .
of course , curiosity , the scientific component of that , was it . it was adventure . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , i could imagine a creature and we could create a special effect for her , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was looking through that window .
as we did in some of our <unk> expeditions , i was looking at <unk> across the <unk> of the water and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before , that actually wasn &apos;t described by science at the same time as we saw them and <unk> them .
so , i was completely <unk> about this , and i had to do more .
so , i made a curious decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to park my work as a director of hollywood , and i &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time <unk> . &quot;
so , we started planning these expeditions .
and we ended up going to the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to fill with <unk> vehicles .
we went back to the remains of the titanic .
we had little robots that we had created with a fiber optic coil .
and the idea was to go in and do an internal recognition of the ship , which had not been done before .
no one had ever seen the remains of <unk> inside , never had the media to do it , so we created a technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am , on the deck of the titanic , sitting in a submersible and looking at the sets that looked a lot like these , where i knew the gang had been playing .
and i flew a little robotic vehicle through the ship hall .
when i say , i manage , but my mind is in the vehicle .
like it was physically present inside the remains of the titanic .
and it was the most surreal <unk> i &apos;ve ever had , because before we had a corner , i knew what was going to be before the lights on the vehicle were slowing down , because it had been folded for months when we were doing the film .
and the <unk> was based on an exact replica of the plane of the ship .
so it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
and it really made me realize the experience of television that you can have with these robots , through which your consciousness is embedded in a vehicle , in some other way of existence .
it was really deep .
and it can be almost like a glimpse of what can be going on in a few decades when we start having <unk> bodies to explore , or for some other medium in many types of future <unk> that i can imagine , like a fan of science fiction .
so , having done these expeditions , i really started to appreciate what was there at the bottom , in the deep ocean where we had these deep animals , they &apos;re basically aliens here on earth .
they live in a habitat for habitat .
they don &apos;t survive a sun @-@ based system like us .
so , you &apos;re looking at animals living around 500 degrees centigrade .
they didn &apos;t even exist .
at the same time , i started being very interested in space science as well , again , is the influence of science fiction , as a child .
and i ended up with the space community , really involved with nasa , with a post in nasa &apos;s advice , planning real space missions , going to russia , checking the <unk> protocols for the pre @-@ <unk> , and all that sort of stuff , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d system .
and it was fascinating .
although what i ended up doing is bringing scientists to space scientists to the deep .
and they had access to them , they were biologists , biologists , planetary scientists , interested in these extreme habitats , <unk> into ventilation , <unk> to see , and take samples and test instruments , and all that stuff .
so , there we were doing documentaries , but actually we were doing science , and particularly space science .
i had closed the bow between being a fan of science fiction , you know , as a child , and doing all this .
and , you know , along the way of this journey of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . although i also learned a lot about leadership .
you can think a conductor has to be a leader , a captain leader , and all that stuff .
i really hadn &apos;t learned about leadership until i did those expeditions .
because i had to , at a certain point , i say , &quot; what am i doing here ? &quot;
why am i doing that ? what am i wearing ? &quot;
we won &apos;t make money with these little programs .
i just run financially . there &apos;s no fame in it .
people think that i would lie somewhere between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i was <unk> the nail , somewhere , sitting on the beach .
i did all those movies , all those documentaries for a very small audience .
no fame , no glory , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , by the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment , which is , by the emotion of discovery , and by that strange <unk> that comes when a small group of people form a very tight team .
because we would do these things with 10 @-@ 12 people working for years at a time . sometimes in the sea for two @-@ and @-@ three months at a time .
and with that <unk> , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have and that you have , when you do something you cannot explain to another .
when you go back to shore and you say , &quot; we have to do this , &quot; and the fiber , and the optical <unk> , and this and the other , all the technology of that , and the difficulty , the aspects of human performance when you &apos;re working in the sea , you can &apos;t explain to people . that &apos;s what maybe policemen have , or people have to happen .
it creates a <unk> , a <unk> of respect .
so , when i went back to make my next movie , which was &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same principle of leadership in which i attached to your team , and so you win your respect .
and that really changed dynamic .
and there i was with a little team , in unexplored terrain in &quot; avatar , &quot; building new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremendously exciting .
tremendously challenging .
and we become a family , over a period of four and a half years .
and that completely changed the way i make movies .
people have <unk> over how it &apos;s changed , well , you know , we brought back to organisms in the ocean and put them on pandora &apos;s planet .
for me , it was more a fundamental way to do the work , the process itself , which changed as a result of that .
so , what can we sum up all this ?
what are the lessons ?
well , i think the first is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you have .
imagination is a force that can manifest a reality .
and the respect for his team is more important than all the <unk> in the world .
young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some advice to do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put you on limits .
other people will do it for you ; don &apos;t do it for you ; don &apos;t harm you ; take risks . &quot;
nasa has a phrase that they love : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has to be a choice in art and exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
and no major effort that has needed innovation has been done without running any risk .
they have to be willing to run risks .
and that &apos;s the thought that i would like to leave you , whatever you do , fail is a choice , but fear doesn &apos;t . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk about energy and climate .
and that might seem a little bit amazing , because my full @-@ time work on the foundation is mostly about vaccines and , about the things that we need to invent and improve the lives of the two billion poorest .
but , energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than anything else on the planet .
climate change means that for many years their crops won &apos;t grow . there will be too much rain , or rain , things will change so that their fragile environment can &apos;t keep .
and that leads to hunger . it leads to <unk> .
climate change will be terrible for them .
also the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could choose a single thing to which it would cost the price to reduce poverty , it would certainly increase energy .
the price of energy has fallen through time .
indeed , the advanced civilization is based on energy advances .
the coal @-@ powered industrial revolution , and even in the years 1900 , we saw a quick decrease in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have <unk> , air conditioning , we can make so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a fantastic situation with electricity in the developed world .
but , as we make it more inexpensively -- and let &apos;s try to make it twice as much cheaper -- we have to fulfill a new constraint , and that restriction has to do with co2 .
co2 is heating the planet , and the equation on co2 is actually very simple .
if you add the co2 that &apos;s being issued , that gives a temperature increase , and that temperature increase gives rise to some very negative effects , the effects on climate and perhaps even worse , the cumulative effects , because natural ecosystems cannot adjust to these rapid changes , and then the ecosystems overlap .
the exact <unk> of how to map from a certain co2 increase , until temperature will have and the exact behavior of variables , there &apos;s some uncertainty of it there , but not too much .
and there are probably uncertainty about what bad those effects are , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the leading scientists about this several times , do we really have to go down to almost zero emissions ?
can &apos;t we just cut half or a quarter ?
and the answer is , until we can &apos;t get near zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
and so , that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we &apos;re a four @-@ foot tall truck trying to get under a four @-@ foot bridge , and we can sort of pass it around just a little bit and a half feet , and we can sort of zoom in .
this is something that has to get to zero .
we make a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over <unk> million tons .
about 20 tons per american . and less than a ton per one in poor countries .
it gives an average of about five tons per person on the planet .
and , in a way , we have to make changes to take that number to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly increasing .
it &apos;s only because of some economic changes that has come to <unk> , so we have to go from rapidly growing to <unk> , and we <unk> all the way down to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication : so you have one thing on the left , co2 which you want to get to zero , and it will be based on the number of people , the services that each person uses on average , energy for every service , and the co2 per unit of energy .
so , look at each one and see how we can go down to zero .
probably some of these numbers will have to get very close to zero .
now , back to high school algebra , but let &apos;s get a <unk> .
first , we have the population .
the world is currently <unk> million people .
and it &apos;s on the way to reach <unk> million .
now , if we do a big job in new vaccines , health care , and reproductive health care services , we might be able to reduce that number , maybe 10 or 15 percent , but that &apos;s where we see some rough increases .
the second thing is the services that we use .
this includes all the food we eat , coat , television , heating .
these are very good things , and eliminating poverty means serving these services to almost everybody on the planet .
and it &apos;s a big thing that this number goes up .
in the rich world , maybe a billion <unk> , we could reduce and use less , but every year , this figure , on average , goes up and then , in general terms , is going to double the services per person .
here &apos;s a very basic service . do you have light in your home so you can read the task ?
in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they go outside and read their homework under the light of the street lamps .
now , the efficiency of e , is energy for every service , here , finally , we have good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various kinds of invention and new ways of doing lighting , through different kinds of cars , different ways of building <unk> , there are a lot of services in which you can significantly reduce energy consumption .
some individual services do it in 90 percent .
there are other services , just like the way to make fertilizers , or <unk> transport , in which the <unk> are much smaller .
and so , in general here , if we &apos;re optimistic , we can maybe get to a factor of three , maybe even a six factor .
but for these three first factors , we go from <unk> million to maybe 8,000 million tons in the best cases , and that doesn &apos;t get the goal .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be the key factor -- and this is the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to come in for every unit of energy .
and the question is , can you really make it go to zero ?
if it &apos;s coal , no .
if you ate natural gas , no .
almost every methods we create electricity today , except for new renewables and nuclear , they emit co2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do on a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need miracles of energy .
when i use the word miracle , i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and services are a miracle .
the people here have been involved in creating lots of miracles .
usually , we don &apos;t have a date , where you have to have a miracle ready for some date .
usually , in a certain sense , and some people come , and some don &apos;t .
this is a case where we really have to move forward at maximum speed and get a miracle in a very tight time .
i thought , how can i really capture this concept ?
is there any kind of natural illustration ? have you any demonstration that <unk> people &apos;s imagination ?
i thought , in the past year , when i brought mosquitoes , and in a sense , people will enjoy it .
i actually managed to get through the idea that , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
so , with energy , the only thing that occurred to me was this .
i decided that migrating fireflies would be my contribution towards the environment , here , this year .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
i &apos;ve been told that i don &apos;t shave , actually , maybe don &apos;t get out of this jar .
now , there are all kinds of intractable solutions like that , but ultimately , they don &apos;t quite add up to it .
we need solutions , it can be one or several , that have an unimaginable scale , and a guaranteed reliability , and , although there are many directions that people are looking for , i only see five that can make big changes .
i gave aside the <unk> , geothermal energy , geothermal , fusion and bio @-@ fuels .
those can come up to make a contribution , and if you can get more of what i hope , much better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work in each of these five , and we can &apos;t get into any of them because they look alike , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s look first at fossil fuels that burn , both burning or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there seems simple , but it &apos;s not , and this is to take all the co2 after the combustion is sent high pressure , create a liquid , <unk> somewhere , and wait it will stay .
we have some pilot tests that accomplish this successfully between 60 and 80 percent , but reaching up to 100 percent , that will be very difficult , and according to where to store these amounts of co2 will be tough , but the most difficult thing here is the long term .
is it going to be safe ?
does it make sure that it &apos;s literally one billion times bigger than any other kind of waste compared to nuclear or other ?
this is a lot of volume .
so , this is complicated .
next , it would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems : the cost is high , particularly in highly <unk> countries . the security issue , feel really good that nothing can fail , that even having human operators , the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what to do with waste ?
and , while it &apos;s not too big , there are lots of concerns about it .
people need to feel quiet about it .
so it &apos;s three very difficult problems that could be solved , and it should be working on them .
we &apos;re going to measure the last three of the five .
these are the ones that many times people refer to as renewable sources .
and actually -- although it &apos;s very good that they don &apos;t require gas -- they have some disadvantages .
one is that energy density in these technologies is dramatically lower than a power plant .
these are energy farms , so we &apos;re talking about lots of square kilometers , thousands of times larger than traditional energy plants .
in addition , these are blinking sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day ; it doesn &apos;t shine every day , and in the same way , the <unk> doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
and so , if we rely on these sources , we have to have some way to get the energy for those periods that is not available .
so , here we have big costs . we have population challenges . for example , if this energy is out of our country , we not only need technology , but we have to deal with the risk of energy coming from elsewhere .
and finally , this storage problem .
and , in order to test it , i investigate , and i looked for all the battery types that are made , for cars , for cars , for phones , <unk> , for everything , and i compared that to the amount of power energy that the world uses , and what i discovered is that all the battery that we &apos;re currently making could store less than 10 minutes of that energy .
so , actually , we need a big advance in this regard , an improvement by a factor of a hundred or more than the advances we have today .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very easy .
this is what happens when you try to get the <unk> source to be up for 20 , 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re relying on this for 100 percent , you need an amazing alternative battery .
how are we going to move ahead with this ? what &apos;s the right way to get it ?
is it like the manhattan project ? what is it that &apos;s going to take us to its destination ?
well , we need a lot of companies working on this , working on it .
in each of these five ways , we need at least a hundred people .
and many of them , the <unk> and say they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have a lot of people who are already chasing this goal .
bill <unk> has several companies , including one called <unk> , which has several very good solar technologies .
<unk> <unk> is investing in dozens of companies that are doing big things , and they have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to figure it out .
with nathan myhrvold : we &apos;re doing a <unk> that &apos;s probably shockingly , in nuclear .
there are innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
and the innovation comes out in this industry quite a long time ago , so the concept that there are some good ideas running is not surprising .
the idea behind <unk> is that instead of burning part of uranium , one percent , which is <unk> , we decided , we &apos;re going to save 99 percent , <unk> .
it &apos;s a crazy idea .
in fact , people have talked about this for a long time , but they could never properly mimic whether it would work or not , and it &apos;s through the arrival of modern supercomputers that you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right approach of materials , it seems that it could work .
and , since you &apos;re burning 99 percent , you have a highly improved profile .
you &apos;re actually burning the waste , and you can use it as a fuel , all the waste that comes from today &apos;s reactors .
so , instead of worrying about them , you use them . it &apos;s a big thing .
it &apos;s consuming this uranium as it &apos;s moving . it &apos;s like a candle .
as you can see there , it &apos;s a log , it <unk> a lot like a radiation wave .
at the gas level , this actually solves the problem .
i have a picture here in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent , of which already took off the side that &apos;s burning right now , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
that <unk> from electricity to the united states for hundreds of years .
and , simply by <unk> seawater through a low @-@ cost process , you &apos;d have enough gas for the entire rest of the planet .
so , you know , it has a lot of challenges ahead , but it &apos;s an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to go ahead .
so , let &apos;s think , how should we define ourselves ?
what should our school address look like ?
well , look where we really have to get , and then look at the intermediate point .
by 2050 , many people listened to this 80 percent reduction .
it &apos;s really important that we get to that point .
and that 20 percent will be used by needs in poor countries like agriculture ; we wish we have cleaned up <unk> and concrete .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed nations , including countries like china , will have had to change its generation completely .
so , the other note is : are we discovering this zero @-@ emission technology ? are we <unk> it in all developed countries ? and are we in the process of bringing it to other places ?
that &apos;s very important .
it &apos;s a key element to pass that school newsletter .
so , going back from there , how should you see the cartoon of the year 2020 ?
well , again , it should have two elements .
we should actually implement these efficiency measures to begin to dramatically reduce . the less <unk> , the less the sum of co2 , and therefore , the less the temperature .
but , in some ways , the note that we get there , doing things that don &apos;t take us all the way down to the big <unk> , is just the same , or maybe even a little less important than the other , which is the piece of innovation of these big breakthroughs .
these advances , we need to move at maximum speed , and we can measure that at the level of companies , race projects , and require that have changed .
there are a lot of good books that have been written about this .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; our <unk> &quot; and the book by david <unk> , &quot; sustainable energy , not hot air . &quot;
they really study it and create a framework for this to be widely discuss , because we need a broad support for this .
there &apos;s a lot to talk about .
so , this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish for this technology .
if i had just one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose who &apos;s president , i could choose a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could choose that this thing that has half the cost and zero co2 emissions is invented this wish for me .
this is the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t have this wish , the division between the people who think in the short term and in the long term will be terrible , between the united states and china , between the poor and rich countries , and most of the lives of those 2,000 million will be much worse .
so , what should we do ?
what am i focusing on you to have a step ahead and drive ?
we need to look more funding for research .
when countries come together in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just argue about co2 .
they should discuss on this innovation agenda , and they would be amazed at these levels of ridiculously low cost on these innovative approaches .
we need the market incentives , co2 taxes , carbon bonds , something that <unk> that price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need this <unk> to be more rational , which is a more <unk> , including the steps that government takes .
this is an important wish , but it &apos;s a wish that i think we can reach .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand more about <unk> , all right -- i mean , first of all : can you give us a sense that scale of what the investment scale would be ?
bill gates : to make the software out of super @-@ computer , to employ all of the big scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials on a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , there would only be only 10 million .
the hard thing to do is build the pilot , get the various billions , find the regulator , where the location is going to build the first of these .
once you have the first built , and if it works like <unk> , then , it &apos;s clear like the day , because economic variables and energy density are as different from nuclear as we know it .
now , is this really important to build on the ground , almost like a vertical nuclear fuel column , of these kinds of uranium already used , and then the process starts from above and then going down ?
<unk> : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always getting gas from the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can have a mistake that you have to open and move things in and out . that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel from which you can now carry for about 60 years -- just think of it as a log -- <unk> and not have those same complications .
and it only stays there and it burns for the 1960s , and then it &apos;s there .
it &apos;s a nuclear plant that includes its own solution of waste disposal .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens with waste , you can leave it there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this approach -- then you can actually grab that one , and put it in another and burn that one .
and we started taking the waste that exists on the day of today , which is in these cooling <unk> or <unk> <unk> , because that &apos;s our fuel to break .
so , what was a problem for those reactors is that we feed our own , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of waste in a fairly <unk> way by going the way .
but when you talk to different people around the world , about these possibilities .
where is there more interest to actually do something with this ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t chosen a particular place , and there are all these rules about anything called nuclear , so we &apos;re very interested in people in the company that &apos;s been in russia , india and china . i &apos;ve been here with the energy secretary , talking about how this might fit into the energy agenda .
so i &apos;m optimistic . french and japanese have done some work .
this is a variation on something that &apos;s been previously done .
it &apos;s a big advance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and many countries have built them , so anyone who &apos;s done a quick reactor is a candidate to be where the first one &apos;s going .
so , in your head , scale of time and probability of putting something online ?
<unk> : well , we need , first of all , one of these things at the expense @-@ generation , that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to implement .
that &apos;s sort of the term that we have to do with environmental models .
and , you know , <unk> , if things work well , which is really wish for a lot , i could easily imagine .
and there are now , fortunately , dozens of companies , but we need them to be hundreds , that at the same time , if their science works well , if the funding for their plants is working well , that they can compete for this .
and it &apos;s better if several of them are successful , because you could use a mix .
we need a successful self .
in terms of large @-@ scale changes , this is the biggest thing you know is there ?
<unk> : a revolutionary progress on energy is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without environmental constraint , but environmental restriction makes it much more important .
in the world of nuclear , there are other innovators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their jobs as well as we know this , but the modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a reactor that looks a little bit difficult , but maybe they &apos;ll tell the same thing about us .
and so , there are several different things , but the beauty in this is that uranium atom has millions of times more energy than for example a carbon atom , and then , if you can deal with the negative spots , which are essentially radiation , footprint and cost , in terms of effect on the ground and various things , it &apos;s almost a category of its own .
what if that doesn &apos;t work , then ?
should we start taking action measure that we should try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
<unk> : if you go into that situation , it &apos;s kind of like you &apos;d be eating more , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack . what do you do ? you probably need heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a line of research on something called geo @-@ engineering , which are various techniques that are <unk> warming to give us a little bit of maybe 20 or 30 years , until we agree .
now , that &apos;s just a insurance <unk> .
you wait not to have to do that .
some people say that you shouldn &apos;t work on the insurance <unk> , because you can do it by <unk> and eating them because you know that your heart surgery can save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the option given to the importance of the problem , but there is now the argument about geo @-@ engineering , if we should have a ready on our sleeve , in case things happen quicker , or that innovation is much slower than it was expected .
climate skeptical : if you had a phrase or two to tell you , like the <unk> that are wrong ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics come from different sides .
scientists who make scientific arguments are very few .
are you saying that there are negative feedback effects that you have to do with clouds that offset things ?
there are very , very few things that you can even say there &apos;s a possibility in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here is something like aids .
you increase the error now , and you pay the price much later .
and so , when you have all kinds of urgent problems , the idea of suffering now that it has to do with a profit later -- and a meaningful suffering -- in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst stage , and there are people in the developed world who look at the ipcc and say , well , this is not such a big deal .
the fact is , it &apos;s that uncertain part , which should be moving towards this .
but my dream here is that if you can do it in an economic way , and fulfilling the constraints of co2 , then the skeptics will say , well , i don &apos;t mind that i don &apos;t eat co2 , i somehow wish i &apos;d co2 , but i think i accept it because it &apos;s cheaper .
and so , that would be your answer to the <unk> argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take your attention away from your other goals to try and release the world of poverty , and malaria and so forth , and that investing money in that is a waste of the resources of the earth when there is better things that we can do .
<unk> : well , real spending on the part of r &amp; amp ; d -- says the united states should spend 10,000 million more than they &apos;re doing now -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t take anything else .
the moment you go into big numbers , and in this reasonable people can disagree , it &apos;s when you have something that &apos;s not economic and you &apos;re trying to cure them . that , to me , is a big deal , a waste .
unless you &apos;re too close to it , and you &apos;re funding the learning curve , and it &apos;s going to get really cheap , i think we should try more things that have a potential to be much less expensive .
if the exchange you &apos;re in is , let &apos;s make the super expensive energy , then the rich can buy it .
i mean , everybody here could pay five times more for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disaster is for those two billion .
and even <unk> has changed .
his <unk> now is , because isn &apos;t he arguing more about me and d ?
he &apos;s still , for his earlier arguments , associated with the side of the skeptical , but he &apos;s realized he &apos;s on a pretty lonely side , and then he &apos;s <unk> the argument of r &amp; amp ; d.
and then there &apos;s a string of something that i think is appropriate .
the part of r &amp; amp ; d , it &apos;s amazing how little it &apos;s being funded .
well bill , i suspect i speak in the name of most people here when i say , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> introduced the <unk> of design called the marshmallow challenge .
and the idea is quite simple . four people have to build an autonomous structure with 20 <unk> of <unk> , a string of tape , a rope <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to go up all the way up .
and although it sounds easy , it &apos;s a fairly difficult thing , because it force people to collaborate very fast .
and so i thought it was an interesting idea , and i put it in a design shop .
and it was a big success .
and since then , i &apos;ve done some 70 design workshops all over the world with students , designers and architects , all the way to the <unk> of major companies , and there &apos;s this particular exercise that reveals deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
most people start <unk> with the task .
members argue and calculate how the structure will look , act out of power .
then you &apos;re planning , organizing . you draw it and you have spaghetti cups .
they spend most of their time riding the <unk> in structures .
and , finally , right when you just run out of time , someone walks the marshmallow , and with a grain of salt , and then they <unk> away , and &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
but actually , what &apos;s often happening is , &quot; ah , &quot; becomes &quot; oh no , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow makes the whole structure collapse .
so there are several people who have more moments &quot; oh no , &quot; than others , and the worse are the graduates in business school .
lie , they cheat , they dissolve , they absorb <unk> structures .
and , of course , there are teams that have lots of more structures , &quot; ah , &quot; and , amongst the best ones , there are the graduates of kindergarten .
and this is quite amazing .
peter tells us , they don &apos;t only get the highest structures , but they &apos;re also the most interesting of all .
so , what you want to ask is : how ? why ? what do you have ?
peter likes to say , &quot; no children try to be the ceo of spaghetti sauce . &quot; right .
they don &apos;t spend time fighting for power .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that business students are trained to find the only right plan , ok .
and then they don &apos;t .
and what happens , when you put the marshmallow over , they stay out of time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
does it sound something ? ok .
what kids do differently is they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , they &apos;ll always keep the marshmallow on top , so they have lots of opportunities for failed prototypes in the process .
designers consider this kind of collaboration like the essence of the biomedical process .
and with every version , children are receiving remarkable observations about what works and what &apos;s not .
so , the ability to play with prototypes is essential , but let &apos;s look at how they deliver different teams .
the average for most people is about half feet , business students , achieve half of that , lawyers , a little bit better , but not much more , kids , better than most adults .
who gets better than anyone ?
architects and engineers , thank god !
the tallest structure i &apos;ve seen is one meter .
why is it ? because they understand that the triangles and the self @-@ sustain patterns are the key to building stable structures .
the ceos , a little bit better than the average , but this is where it gets interesting .
if you put a management executive in the team , ceos get a lot better .
it &apos;s amazing . let &apos;s take a look and say , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can see them beforehand . and why ?
because they have special <unk> skills .
they drive the process , they understand it .
and any team that manages and is doing well in work will really enhance the throughput of their team .
specialized skills and <unk> skills , and the combination leads you to success .
if you have 10 teams that usually work together , we &apos;ll work with about six stable structures .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s break the bet .
i decided to give 10,000 dollars in software to the winning team .
and what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . none of the teams succeeded .
if someone would have built , say , an inch structure , they could have taken their house award .
isn &apos;t it interesting that high risk has a strong impact ?
we did the same test with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
under these conditions , they understood the value of prototypes .
and the same team step from being the worst to being amongst the best .
they get the tallest structures in the short time .
there are important lessons here about the phenomenon of incentives and success .
you were like , &quot; why would someone spend time designing a <unk> challenge ? &quot;
and the reason is , i will help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars , video games and visual effects .
and the challenge of the marshmallow is to help you identify the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , all the projects have their marshmallow , right ?
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common posture of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of the experience , of this simple exercise .
and those of you , you probably want to visit <unk>
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build <unk> .
there are <unk> @-@ <unk> instructions on this .
there are crazy examples that come from around the world of how people change and <unk> the system .
there are world records as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i think , is that design is a contact sport .
it demands that we have all of our senses on the task , and by applying our best ideas , our feelings and acts on the <unk> that we care about .
and sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is all that we need to take us out of a &quot; oh @-@ no @-@ &quot; moment &quot; at a moment . &quot;
and that can create a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s realize right here is a machine .
a big machine , a super @-@ linear machine , ted style , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and that everyone in this room has to get in .
and you can go back , you can go to the front ; you can &apos;t stay where you are .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i was asking my friends this question quite recently , and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before they had <unk> or twitter , or &quot; american idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of <unk> towards <unk> , towards magic thinking .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group ; i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because the possibilities on this planet are not going back ; they &apos;re going forward .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go ahead .
this is the best time i &apos;ve ever spent on this planet under any criteria you want to use : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , disease rates down .
there &apos;s never been a while like this .
my <unk> died , all of them when they arrived at 60 .
my grandparents were cutting that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in 80 .
so it &apos;s better than there &apos;s a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is much bigger than that .
a child born in new delhi today can hope to live as much as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about that . it &apos;s an amazing fact .
and why is this true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed millions of people on this planet .
it <unk> the demographics in a way that no war has done it .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s disappeared .
we <unk> it . we <unk> it .
in the rich world , diseases which <unk> millions of us only one generation back , there is almost no more .
<unk> , <unk> , polio ...
someone even knows they &apos;re these things ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are wins from the scientific method .
and in my mind , the scientific method , testing things , see if it works , change it when it doesn &apos;t work , is one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the only good news , because there are other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is , despite all of our achievements , a billion people are going to bed hungry in this world , every day .
that number is growing , and very fast , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to <unk> this world .
clean water , <unk> soil , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re running out , and they &apos;re running out very soon , and unless you start off in a solution to this disaster , you &apos;re <unk> us too .
so , the question is : we can do it ? i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that <unk> billions of people without <unk> the land we live in .
i think we can feed this world with energy that we can &apos;t do it at once .
i really believe this , and , no , it &apos;s not magic thinking .
but there &apos;s one thing that doesn &apos;t allow me to sleep -- one of the things that keeps me awake ; we &apos;ve never needed the progress of science more than now .
and we &apos;ve never been in a position to do this properly , as we can today .
we &apos;re at the edge of amazing events in many different fields , and yet , i certainly think we should go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we &apos;re going to cross progress , where we &apos;re going to measure these things more <unk> , on more fronts , than we &apos;re doing now .
people lie in their beliefs , and they make it so <unk> that you can &apos;t release .
it won &apos;t even be free .
and listen , everybody has a right to have their opinion ; they have a right to have their opinion about progress .
but you know what &apos;s wrong ?
you have no right to have your own facts . sorry , but you don &apos;t .
and realizing this took me a while .
a decade ago , i wrote a story about vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a short story .
and i &apos;m just surprised to find opposition , as opposed to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and i went on .
and soon after that , i wrote an article on genetically modified foods .
the same thing happened , only worse .
people applaud .
so i took a paper on that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenstein , &quot; why we found that moving the <unk> back in a specific way , more and less neglected the terrain of nature .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article and i went ahead .
i mean , i &apos;m just a journalist .
<unk> , <unk> , go to dinner , all right .
but these stories provided me , and i couldn &apos;t understand why , and i finally understood .
and that happened because the <unk> who were getting me crazy were not really fans .
i was thinking people , decent educated , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and that worried me so much .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress that we used to have .
we talk about him <unk> .
we talk about it in <unk> terms , quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we have lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why we haven &apos;t done it .
you can just say a few names and people will vote it up .
<unk> , <unk> , challenger , <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , <unk> electoral <unk> .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe that they were always right . so , be skeptical .
ask , &quot; <unk> evidence . &quot;
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get evidence , you have to accept evidence , and we &apos;re not good at doing that .
and the reason i can say this is because we &apos;re now in a fear epidemic i &apos;ve never seen before , and i hope i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a post was published , a horrible story , that <unk> the autism epidemic to receive the vaccine against measles , <unk> and <unk> .
very scary .
lots of studies were done to see if this was true .
lots of studies had to be done , that &apos;s a serious issue .
the results arrived .
the results came from the united states , england , from sweden , from canada , and everything was the same , no correlation , no connection , anything .
that doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe in what we see , what we think we see , in what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a lot of documents from government giving us information , and i understand that , i think we all understand .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disastrous .
disastrous for this fact : the united states is one of the few countries in the world where immunization rate is going down .
this is unfortunate , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it &apos;s horrible .
what kind of thing happened to be able to do that .
now , i understand . i certainly understand it .
because here , any of you have measles ?
have you ever seen anyone die from measles ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very much .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened sometimes in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of measles deaths . 20 an hour .
but because it didn &apos;t happen here , we can get it out of our minds , and people like jenny can pick out scary messages and illiteracy from people like oprah and larry <unk> .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t have causality and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these two things look the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same thing .
and it &apos;s something we have to learn , and we need to learn very soon .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
it <unk> away from us one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no agony . polio , no more .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul <unk> .
he only developed a <unk> vaccine with a group of people .
he saves the life of 400,000 children per year , in the culinary world .
pretty good , no ?
well , it &apos;s okay , except , because paul is out there talking about vaccines , and he says how valuable they are and that people should just stop .
and it really says that .
so , paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks in a public audience , he can &apos;t deal with armed guards .
he gets calls in his house , because people like to tell him they remember where their kids are going to college .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
and i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you get them out , and disease comes back , horrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of that again , because it &apos;s just a game of numbers .
and they &apos;re not going to die only from measles .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a colleague of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and he said he thought i was a little stubborn .
never before had anyone said that .
she was not going to be able to get her son against polio . anyway .
okay .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy took a plane in lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to los angeles , right now he &apos;s on ohio .
and it &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , it &apos;s going to rent a car , and it &apos;s going to come to long beach , and it &apos;s going to go and go and go and go to one of these fantastic ted dinners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet we live on . let &apos;s not do it as we don &apos;t .
now , we love <unk> . we love doing it .
everybody got their vitamins this morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> to stay young .
i know they did it because half americans do it every day .
they take those things , and they take choices , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they don &apos;t serve at all .
the data tells you all the time .
your urine . they almost never do more than that .
okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m totally with you .
urine , dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand , we hate the great drug .
we hate big governments . we don &apos;t trust the guy .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system sucks .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolute and amazingly cold , and it &apos;s even for those that we can pay for .
so take it off , and where do we run ?
we jump to the arms of the great plains .
it &apos;s fantastic . i love the great <unk> .
but , you know , it &apos;s a really serious thing , because these things are garbage , and we spend billions of dollars on them .
and i have all kinds of little supplements here .
none of them -- <unk> , fraud , fraud , <unk> , fraud , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know it &apos;s , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on this ; it &apos;s a fraud .
and you know what ? when i say this , people shout me out , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do whatever you want .
he makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i &apos;m not going to mind if it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m not going to do any case of the evidence of my experts at <unk> , &quot; or some sort of an oncologist who wants to treat your patient with coffee <unk> .
when you start the <unk> where you believe and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in south africa .
he killed 400,000 people from his people to insist that <unk> and lemon oil was much more effective than anti @-@ retroviral drugs that we know can reduce aids progress .
hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths in a country that has been fighting more than any one for this disease .
please don &apos;t tell me that there &apos;s no consequences of these things .
there are them . there &apos;s always them .
now , the most insane epidemic in which we are , right now , is this insane battle between which genetically modified foods and organic elite .
it &apos;s a <unk> debate . it has to end .
it &apos;s a word debate , metaphors .
ideology is not science .
every thing we eat , every grain of rice , every <unk> of <unk> , every <unk> in brussels , has been modified by the man .
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden of eden .
there was no <unk> .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some things worked and some didn &apos;t .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more precisely . and there are risks , absolutely . but we can put some vitamin a in rice , and that can help millions of people , millions of people , to extend their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i must say , i don &apos;t understand .
we distract ourselves from genetically modified foods .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , crop , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want life companies .
we don &apos;t want seed companies .
and you know what my answer to that is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . they &apos;re <unk> .
it &apos;s true , we have a very big food problem , but this is not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s the law ; it &apos;s the moral ; it &apos;s the patent issue .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea . it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t afford science to do its work because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s really fatal , and this preventing millions of people can thrive .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to produce 70 percent more food than today , 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
they need it , and we &apos;re not going to hate it .
and why ? genetically modified foods .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat those bad things , like <unk> , for example .
<unk> is something that 500 million people eat .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a lot of calories . it sucks .
and it has no nutrients , it has no proteins , and scientists are bending all of this in it right now .
and then people could eat it , and they could avoid being blind .
you wouldn &apos;t be starving , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be &quot; <unk> , &quot; but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is , why are we exhausted ?
i mean , <unk> : why are we exhausted ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes back .
it &apos;s about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> to have bigger food , better food , unique food .
now , this is not about &quot; rice burroughs , &quot; this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s time that we start to understand what that means .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue acting like this now , we are guilty of something that i don &apos;t think we should be guilty of being guilty , <unk> .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beyond us , and we really have to fix it .
so , after this funny conversation <unk> , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get into this ridiculous machine of time and go ahead ? &quot;
absolutely . i want to .
it &apos;s <unk> in the present now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can program that time machine in what we want .
we can move where we want , and we &apos;re going to move where we want to move .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but when we get into the machine and go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy to do it .
i know we can , and , as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something that the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the effect of <unk> , which might seem a strange thing about what a magician might be interested in , not to be aware of the way that i do , which is &quot; if somebody believes something fake enough , it becomes real . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in some studies , placebo effect , just because one person thinks that what &apos;s going on is a pharmaceutical thing , or something like driving pain management , for example , if you believe enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect on the body , called the placebo effect .
something fake turns into something real because of the perception you have .
to make us understand better , i want to start by showing you a simple magic trick and rudimentary .
and i will demonstrate to you how it works . this is a trick that has been in children &apos;s books since at least the 1950s .
i learned it from the <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it to you .
and then i &apos;ll tell you why i explained it .
this is what happens .
the knife , which you can examine : my hand , which you can examine .
he <unk> the knife in my coat like this .
hold my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing goes up or down , hold up my right wrist here .
so , at no point , something can move around , at the time that my wrist says , nothing can go up or down my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and i hope , if all this <unk> , my animal magnetism <unk> the knife .
in fact , it &apos;s sustained so strongly that i can relax , and the knife doesn &apos;t fall .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , nothing you can look at everything .
<unk> @-@ da !
so , this is the trick that i usually teach young people who are interested in <unk> , because they can learn a lot about delusions studying this trick -- even though it &apos;s a simple trick .
probably a lot of you in this room know the trick .
what happens is this .
i &apos;m holding the knife with my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to hold my wrist , and make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , it &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding my wrist is because that &apos;s really the secret of illusion .
at the moment that my hand &apos;s front moves to be hidden from you , this finger , my finger will move where it is , to a position pointed like that .
very good .
someone who didn &apos;t have childhood is over there .
so , it &apos;s moving over here .
and as i move , my finger moves .
and we could talk about why it &apos;s a deception , why they didn &apos;t realize there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three . we exercise it .
but that &apos;s not really what this is all about . right ? so , i open my hand .
obviously , it &apos;s hanging there and not by animal magnetism , if not fraud , my finger lies there .
and when i close my finger , like that , when i move , this movement in a way covers my finger &apos;s <unk> .
he retirement his hand . he <unk> the knife .
this is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
i read a study , about a year ago , that really opened my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me was an amazing thing .
it turns out that if you use a placebo in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s kind of the shape of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round pill , it has certain measurable effects .
but if you change the way you measure placebo , like doing a smaller pill , the blue <unk> , and you put a letter , it &apos;s notoriously effective .
even though none of the two have a pharmaceutical effect -- those are sugar pills .
but the white pill , it &apos;s not as good as the blue pill .
what ? that really stuck with me .
but it turns out that &apos;s not all .
if you have caps , they &apos;re more effective than any other tablet .
a colored capsule , this is yellow on one side and red on the other ; it &apos;s <unk> that a white capsule .
<unk> has something to do with this .
a pill twice a day , it &apos;s not as good as three <unk> -- i don &apos;t remember the statistics now . sorry .
but the point is ...
these little <unk> have something to do with it .
and the shape also has something to do with it .
and if you want the last placebo , you go to the needles .
right ? so , a syringe a pair of <unk> a couple of <unk> , and we <unk> this to the patient .
this is a very powerful picture in your mind , this is much stronger than any white pill .
really , this graph , i &apos;m going to show you in another moment when the slides are over .
the point is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , and this is not as good as the capsule and this is not as good as the needle .
and no one really has any pharmaceutical quality . it &apos;s just your belief that makes it real in your body and creates a strong effect .
i &apos;d like to see if you could actually take that idea , and apply it to a magic trick .
take something which is really a fake trick and make it look real .
and we know from that study , that when you want something real , you get distracted by the needles .
this is a seven @-@ inch nail hat . it &apos;s very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to play it a little bit .
this is my tissues . this is not a special tissue .
this is my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to penetrate my skin , and get through the needle into the other side .
if you were squeamish -- if you were easily distracted -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel on the other night , and other people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman nearly drowned .
so i would suggest that if you &apos;re easily distracted , look on the other side by the next few <unk> , actually , you know what , i &apos;m going to do this first thing to hide .
you &apos;ll see , you can look for something else if you want .
so , this is what happens , the beginning of my tissue in the back of my arm , i made a little <unk> .
sorry , am i wrong ?
and i rub my skin a little bit , and i take it off the other side like this .
now , we &apos;re essentially in the same position as the knife trick .
somehow .
but right now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so let me give you one , two , three , four , five .
yes , good ...
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; well , he &apos;s not as silly as to cut the skin just like <unk> for a few minutes . &quot;
so , let me show you a little bit .
how are they going ? okay .
yeah .
and people back up there will say , &quot; well , i really didn &apos;t see it . &quot;
the people in the <unk> room are starting to move .
let me show you a little bit more .
this is really my skin . this is not a hollywood <unk> .
this is my flesh , and i can move around .
sorry , if you &apos;re squeamish , look for another <unk> , don &apos;t look at this .
the people in the back or the people who see the video will say , &quot; well , you see the effect , &quot; but if it were real , he would do this -- notice that there &apos;s a gap here and there , if it were real , it would be <unk> .
well , let me show you a little bit of blood .
yes , there it is .
normally , now it would be getting the needle off .
i <unk> my arm and show you that there &apos;s no wounds .
but i think in this context , and with the idea of taking something fake , and making it real , i &apos;ll leave it like that , and get out of the stage .
i &apos;m going to be looking at them several times during the <unk> days .
i hope you will . thank you very much .
everybody speaks about happiness over these days .
i made someone tell the number of books with the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the title , published in the last five years and gave up for about 40 , and there were many more .
there &apos;s an enormous amount of interest in happiness , between researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of advice about happiness .
everybody would like to do the happiest people .
but despite all this crowd of jobs , there are several peaks of cognitive kinds that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be about all these cognitive traps .
this is so much about the ordinary people who think of their own <unk> as the academics who think about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re as confused as others .
the first of these traps is <unk> in <unk> .
turns out that the word happiness is no longer a useful word because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we might be able to shave , but in general , this is something that we &apos;re going to have to throw away , and we &apos;re going to have to adopt the more complicated view of what well @-@ being is .
second trap is a confusion between experience and memory : especially being happy with your life and be happy to value your life as happy .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both embedded in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the focus illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think of any <unk> that affects well @-@ being without <unk> its importance .
i mean , this is a fundamental cognitive trap .
it &apos;s impossible not to be wrong .
now i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone in a question session , answers after some of my lectures that told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he &apos;d been listening to a symphony and which was an absolutely wonderful music and at the end of the recording , there was a horrible sound .
and then he said , really , really affected , that had <unk> the whole experience .
but it wasn &apos;t .
what had gone missing was the memories of that experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of a beautiful music .
and they didn &apos;t know at all , because it stuck with a memory , the memory had <unk> up , and it was all that was left .
what this tells us , actually , is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two <unk> .
there &apos;s a self that has experiences , that lives in the present and meets the present , is able to revive the past , but it basically has only the present .
it &apos;s the self that has experiences that treat a doctor when you ask , &quot; do you hurt now , when i play here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a self that remembers , and the self that reminds is that it takes note , and it holds the history of our life , and that is that the doctor asks him , &quot; how does it feel ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something .
these are two very different entities , the self that has experiences and the self that has memories and <unk> between them is part of problematic happiness .
now , the self that has memories is a storyteller .
and that really begins with an immediate response to our memories -- it &apos;s starting to melt .
we don &apos;t just tell stories , when we tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what remains to remind us of our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
this is an old study .
these are real patients being treated by painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into detail . it &apos;s not painful these days , but it was , when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to work on their pain every 60 seconds .
and here we have two patients . this is their data .
and if you ask , &quot; who suffered more ? &quot;
it &apos;s a very easy question .
of course , the patient b suffered more -- his <unk> lasted longer , and every minute of pain that the patient had , was also the patient b and even more .
but now we ask another question : &quot; how many of these patients have suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s the surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a had a much worse memory of the <unk> than the patient b.
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ended .
and none of these stories inspire or great stories , but one of them is different ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the one that &apos;s worse is that the pain of the end was a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people after the <unk> , and a lot later , &quot; how painful was the experience , usually ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in the way you remember it .
so , it &apos;s a direct conflict between me and experience and the self that reminds .
from the point of view of the self that has experiences , it &apos;s clear that b had a worse experience .
now , what we could do with the patient a , and indeed do clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , it could really extend the <unk> of the patient a to just keep the tube away without it moving too much .
that will make the patient suffer , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do it for a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve made the self that has experiences from the patient a to tell you a worse situation , and that the self that reminds from the patient a &apos;s is much better , because now you &apos;ve provided the patient a better story about their experience .
what defines a story ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory provides us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
what defines a story is changes , important moments and end .
the end is very , very important , and in this case , we &apos;ll take the end .
now , the self that has experiences lives live in a continuous way .
it has experiences , one after the other .
and you wonder , what about these experiences ?
and the answer is very simple . they lose forever .
i mean , most of the moments in our life -- and i &apos;ve calculated this -- <unk> , the psychological present is that it has about three seconds of length , which means that in a life there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there are close to 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any trace .
most of them are completely ignored by the self that reminds .
and yet , somehow , it seems to us that they should be aware that what happens to us in these moments and experiences is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource that we have while we &apos;re in this world .
and how to use it , it seems to be relevant , but that &apos;s not the story that we have for ourselves the self to remember .
so we have the self that reminds and the self that has experiences , and they &apos;re really different .
the biggest difference between them is in their treatment of time .
from the point of view of the self that has experiences , if you have a vacation , and the second week is as good as the first , then these two @-@ week vacation , are twice as good as compared to a week vacation .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all , i remember .
for me , remember , two weeks of vacation , they &apos;re just better than a week &apos;s vacation , because they &apos;re not going to get new memories .
it hasn &apos;t changed history .
and in this way , time is really the fundamental variable that distinguishes the self that remembers that it has experiences . time has very little impacts on this story .
now , the self that reminds more than remember and storytelling .
actually , it &apos;s the one who makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two <unk> with two different surgeons and has to decide which of them to choose , then , engage that surgeon who has a less <unk> memory than a surgeon .
the self that has experiences has no voice or vote in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think about our future normally in terms of experiences .
we think of our future in terms of predictable memories .
and you can essentially see , like a tyranny of self that reminds , and you can think of it as being a <unk> to the self that has experiences to have experiences that it doesn &apos;t really need .
i have a sense that when we go on holiday this is a very frequent case , i mean , we go on vacation , largely , to the service of myself , remember .
and i think this is a little hard to justify .
i mean , how much do we think about our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that we have for the mastery of self to remember .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we had at antarctica a few years ago , which were certainly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think about them in relative frequency , compared to the amount of other vacation .
and i probably thought about my memories of that three @-@ week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 photos on it , i would have spent another time .
that for three weeks , and that &apos;s about an hour and a half .
there seems to be a fault .
well , i can look a little bit extreme , in the very few people , and i have to think about my memories , but even if i look at it more time , there &apos;s a big question . why do we give our memories so much importance to the importance that we give to experiences ?
so i want you to come up with an experiment about thought .
imagine that in your next holidays , you know , at the end of your vacation , all your photos are being taken , and you &apos;ll buy a drug <unk> so you didn &apos;t burn anything .
now , do you have the same vacation ?
and if you go to a few different holidays , there would be a conflict between your two <unk> , and you have to think about how you might lose that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not so obvious , because , if you put it in terms of time , then you &apos;ll get a response . and if you break it in terms of memories , you &apos;ll get another answer .
why do we choose the holidays we choose ? it &apos;s a problem that takes us back to a choice between the two <unk> .
now , the two <unk> do pose two notions of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can benefit from , one for each of us .
so you can ask : how happy is the self that has experiences ?
and then you get excited : how are you happy in the life of the self that has experiences ?
and everyone is -- happiness at every time is a pretty complicated process .
what emotions can be measured ?
and , by the way , we are now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the self that has experiences over time .
if you ask for the happiness of me , remember , it &apos;s a whole different thing .
it &apos;s not about how someone &apos;s happy .
it &apos;s about how it <unk> a person when you think about their life .
a very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these concepts , it &apos;s going to be confused at the study of happiness , and i &apos;m involved in a group of masters of well @-@ being , who have been confused into the study of happiness for a long time due to it .
the distinction between the happiness of the self that has experiences and the satisfaction of the self that reminds has been recognized in the last few years , and currently it &apos;s trying to measure both .
the gallup organization does a world interview with over half a million people who have asked them what they think about their life and their experiences , and there have been other <unk> in that sense .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two <unk> .
and the main lesson i think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how satisfied someone with their life , and that doesn &apos;t really tell you anything about whether they &apos;re living their lives happily and vice versa .
to give an idea of correlation , correlation is 0.5 .
which means if you met someone , and they said , &quot; oh , his father is six feet tall , how much do you know about his height ? &quot;
well , you know something about your height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
you still have a lot of uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone <unk> their life with eight on a scale of 10 , there &apos;s still a whole lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with respect to their self that has experiences .
so , the correlation is low .
we know something about what controls self &apos;s happiness .
we know that money is very important , our goals are very important .
we know happiness is fundamentally being satisfied with all the people we like to be , spending time with the people we like .
there are other pleasures , but this is the dominant one .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two <unk> , you want to do very different things .
the conclusion of what i said here is that you really shouldn &apos;t think of happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being .
it &apos;s a whole different concept .
now , very quickly , another reason why we can &apos;t think carefully about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we really live .
so , if you ask just how happy is california people , you &apos;re not going to get an answer right .
when you ask that question , you think people should be happier in california than if you live in ohio , say .
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , you &apos;re thinking about the contrast between california and elsewhere , and that contrast is , for example , climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for me who has experiences , and it &apos;s not even very important for me to think that it &apos;s deciding how happy people are .
now , because the self that you step back is the one who sends , you can end up -- some people can end california .
and it &apos;s interesting to discover what happens to people who move to california with the hope to be happier .
well , his self that has experiences is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but it &apos;s going to happen one thing . they &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because , when you think about it , you &apos;ll remember how awful it was in ohio . and you &apos;ll think they made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think clearly about well @-@ being , and i hope to give you an idea of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you very much .
when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned there was a very interesting result that came out of the gallup poll .
is there something that can tell us , because there &apos;s still some time left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the gallup poll is a number , which is not meant to find at all .
we found that number with respect to the happiness of the self that has experiences .
when you look at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out , below about 60,000 dollars a year , for the americans , and this is a very big sample of americans , around 600,000 , is a representative sample significant , under the income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 60 .
60,000 <unk> : 60,000 <unk> .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re much more unhappy as poor they are .
but above that threshold , we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen very flat lines .
now , obviously , what happens is that money doesn &apos;t buy the happiness of our experiences , but the lack of money with security produces misery , and we can measure that misery very precisely .
in terms of the other self , the self that reminds , the story is different .
the more money you make , the more you want these .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , the primary american challenge focuses on life , freedom and search for happiness .
if people take this statement seriously , it seems to me to analyze everything that we believe about , say , the fiscal policy and issues like that .
is there any possible possibility that politicians , who the country in general , decided to take this very seriously and informed public policy on it ?
<unk> : you know that i think there &apos;s a recognition of the role of happiness in public policy .
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , there &apos;s no doubt about it , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s recognizing , and in other countries it &apos;s recognizing .
people recognize that they have to think about happiness when they think about public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study the happiness of our experiences , or whether they want to study the <unk> of life , so we have to have that very soon .
how do you increase happiness , you see it in different ways depending on what you think , and if you do it on the self that you remember or the self that has experiences .
that &apos;s going to influence public policy , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , it &apos;s trying to measure the experience of the population .
this will form , in the next decade or the next decade , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me , that this topic is going to be , or at least it should be , the most interesting political argument to develop in the next few years .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
thank you danny <unk>
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal , game designer .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years . my goal for the next decade is to try to make the world so easy to save in real life as it is in the world of online games .
and i have a plan to do that , and that &apos;s supposed to convince more people to join you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
today , we spend 3 billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you may be thinking , &quot; it &apos;s a lot of time to happen playing games . &quot;
maybe too long , consider the number of problems to solve in the real world .
but actually , according to my research , at the institute for <unk> actually the opposite happens .
three billion hours a week , it &apos;s not enough play time to solve the most intractable problems .
in fact , i think if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase that radically .
i &apos;ve calculated the full need for 21 billion hours of play per week .
it &apos;s probably a little intuitive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , that makes a dent . if we want to solve problems like : hunger , climate change , global conflicts , obesity , i think we have to aspire to play online at least 21 billion hours a week for the end of the next decade .
no , i really say .
here &apos;s why , this image sums up a lot of why i think games are essential for the future survival of the human species . seriously .
this is a portrait of a photographer named timothy <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotion of play , so he put a camera in front of the players while he was playing .
this is a classic emotion in games .
now , if you don &apos;t play , you &apos;ll get a few nuances in this picture .
you probably see the sense of urgency , maybe a little bit of fear , but intense concentration to address a really complex problem .
if you play <unk> , here are some nuances , the guts of your eyes and around your mouth is a sign of optimism . and your eyebrows up is surprise .
this is a player about something called <unk> triumph .
you &apos;ve heard that . okay . okay . so , there &apos;s players among us .
<unk> triumph is such an extraordinarily positive result that you didn &apos;t know it was possible until it succeeded .
it was almost beyond what you think .
and when you get to that , it &apos;s very surprising to discover what you were able to do . that &apos;s a remarkable triumph .
this is a player on the edge of a <unk> triumph .
and this is the face that we need to see in millions of different kinds of problems around the world as we measure the obstacles of the next century , the face of someone who , against all kinds of bet , is at the edge of a winning triumph .
unfortunately , this is the face that we most see in daily life when we try to address pressing problems .
this is what i call &quot; <unk> &quot; -- i &apos;m not good in life . &quot; and this is me putting that face up . right ? yes , good .
that &apos;s me putting a face of &quot; i &apos;m not good at life . &quot;
this is a graffiti graffiti in my former berkeley neighborhood , california , where i did my ph.d. from why we &apos;re better at games than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we feel that we &apos;re not as good in reality as games .
and i &apos;m not just saying good in terms of success , although it &apos;s part of that .
we get more in play worlds , but i also want to say good in terms of motivation to do something important that inspires and cooperate .
and when we &apos;re in the worlds of games , i think a lot of us become the best version of ourselves , the most willing to help instantly , the most <unk> to follow a problem that is necessary , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we fail , when we often feel these obstacles .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re concerned , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing online , it just doesn &apos;t exist in games .
so i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what about games makes us feel -- there &apos;s nothing we can &apos;t accomplish ?
how can we take those feelings of the games and challenge the real world work ?
so i &apos;m going to play games like world of warcraft , which is really a kind of creative resolution environment .
and i started looking at some things that make the success possible on online worlds .
the first thing is , whenever you come up in one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters that are immediately willing to benefit from the world .
but not any mission , but a mission that <unk> perfectly with the current level of one in the game , right ?
so you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you cannot achieve .
but it &apos;s at the edge of what you &apos;re able to do , so you have to deal with it , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
there &apos;s no such thing as sitting in <unk> : there &apos;s always something specific and important to do .
and there &apos;s also a lot of collaborators .
wherever you go , there are hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to get your epic mission .
it &apos;s not something that we have in real life so easily this sense that in the palm of hand there is a whole bunch of collaborators .
and there &apos;s also this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , what we &apos;re doing .
and then there &apos;s all that positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about raising levels and strength + 1 , and intelligence + 1 .
we don &apos;t have that constant feedback in real life .
when i leave the stage , i &apos;m not going to give + 1 , crazy idea + 1 , or crazy idea , 20 + 20 .
i don &apos;t have that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with online collaborative settings like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to the edge of a triumph , all the time we decided to spend all of our time in these conversational worlds .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so far , together , all the world cup players have spent <unk> million years solving the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might seem a bad thing .
but to put it in context : <unk> million years ago , our human ancestors stood up .
that was the first primate walk .
so when we talk about how much time we currently invest in online games , the only way that it makes sense to even think about it , is to talk about the time in the magnitude of human evolution that &apos;s remarkable .
but it &apos;s a right thing . because it turns out that all this time playing online , we &apos;re actually changing what we &apos;re able to do as human beings .
we &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and <unk> .
it &apos;s true . i believe this .
consider this really interesting statistic . it was published recently by a carnegie mellon researcher , the average girl today in a country who is labeled a game culture , there will be 10,000 hours playing online for the 21st years .
now , 10,000 hours is really an interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for american kids , <unk> hours , it &apos;s the exact time that &apos;s going to be in school from fifth grade to high school graduation when they have perfect assistance .
so we have a whole parallel education path going on where young people learn so much about what they need to be a good player as everything else in school .
probably many of you have read the new book by <unk> gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
you &apos;ve heard about their success theory of success from 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can get over 10,000 hours of biomedical study , in something for the age of 21 , we &apos;ll be planning on that .
we &apos;re going to be as good at what we &apos;re doing as the great person on the planet .
and , now that we think about it , there &apos;s a whole generation of young people who are gamers to play .
so the big question is , &quot; what are these players doing ? &quot;
because if we could know that we would have something virtually unprecedented , these human resources in our hands .
that &apos;s how we now have a lot of people in the world who spend at least an hour playing online .
it &apos;s our binary players . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion extremely good players in whatever .
if you don &apos;t know it already , it &apos;s coming .
the games industry is developing <unk> that burn very little energy , and they work with wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that the real world players in india , china , brazil , can access .
they expect a billion more players in the next decade .
it will get us to 1.5 billion players .
so , i &apos;ve started thinking , what are these games doing to us ?
here are the four things i found . the first is the urgent optimism .
well , think of this as an extreme motivation .
the urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to deal with a closely associated with belief that we have a reasonable success hope .
the players always believe that it &apos;s possible a daunting success and it &apos;s always worth trying , and doing so now .
they &apos;re not sitting there doing anything .
the players are <unk> <unk> the social plot .
there are lots of interesting research that show that we like more people after playing with them even if they &apos;ve been beat up .
and the reason is that it demands a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they &apos;re going to spend their time with us that they &apos;re going to play under the same rules as the same goal , they &apos;re going to stay in the game all the way down .
so playing a game together actually builds ties , trust and cooperation .
and as a result , we build stronger social relations .
<unk> productivity . i love it .
there &apos;s a reason why the global average player of warcraft plays 22 hours a week like a half @-@ hour job .
it &apos;s because we know that , when we play a game , we &apos;re actually much happier at work than relaxed or hanging out .
we know that we are human beings , doing a significant job .
the players are willing to work a lot of the time , if you give them the proper work .
finally , the <unk> purpose .
players love impressive amazing human history missions .
so , some data to put that in perspective . everyone knows wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second biggest wiki in the world , with about 80,000 articles is the wiki of warcraft .
five million people use it a month .
there are more information about world warcraft on the internet than any other sub @-@ saharan <unk> on any other wiki in the world .
they &apos;re building a epic story .
they &apos;re building a <unk> knowledge resource on world of warcraft .
well , these are four superpowers who come to be one thing : players are optimistic individuals with superpowers .
they are people who believe that they are capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is , they think they &apos;re able to change virtual worlds , and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist named edward <unk> .
his job is brilliant . he studies why people spend so much time , energy , and money on online worlds .
and it says , &quot; we are seeing quantities -- not lower than a mass <unk> -- to virtual worlds and online environments . &quot;
and it &apos;s an economist , and therefore rational .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a game designer , i &apos;m exuberant .
but he says that this has all the meaning , because players can achieve more in virtual worlds than in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life . they have better feedback and they feel more rewarded in the games than in real life .
so it says , by now it has all the sense that players spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world .
i also think that &apos;s rational , right now .
but it &apos;s not , in any way , an optimal situation .
we need to begin to make the real world more like a game .
i was inspired by something that happened 2,500 years ago .
so , these are early <unk> , made out of sheep . right ?
before the fantastic game controllers , we had <unk> .
and these represent the first play team designed by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historian , you know this story . it &apos;s the story of who and why he invented games .
<unk> says that games , in particular given , were invented in the kingdom of deals for a famine period .
apparently , there was such a serious famine that the king of deals decided they had to do something crazy .
people suffered . people suffered .
it was an extreme situation . they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to <unk> , the games were invented , and a policy was established all over the kingdom : one day , everybody would eat . and the next day , everybody would eat .
and you would be so <unk> in the start of dice because games are so attractive , and you dip into such <unk> productivity and you &apos;re going to have a great deal of <unk> .
and then the next day , we <unk> the day playing , and the other day we feed .
and according to <unk> , they lived 18 years like this , they surviving famine on a day , playing the next day .
i think that &apos;s exactly right now , because games are used today .
we play to get away from the suffering of the real world .
we use games to get rid of all that &apos;s broken in the real environment , all we don &apos;t get tired of the real world and take what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is very exciting .
as a matter of course , after 18 years , famine had not <unk> , so the king decided that it would take a start of dice .
we need to divide into two parts the entire kingdom .
they played a start of dice and the winners of the game will lead into a epic adventure .
they were trying , and they were looking for a new home , leaving enough people to survive with the resources available , and hopefully to bring civilization to some place where they could thrive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , evidence of dna has shown that the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> empire actually shared the same dna with the ancient <unk> .
and so , recently , scientists have suggested that the crazy story of <unk> is true .
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted about 20 years , which would explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
they could have really saved their culture playing games for 18 years , and then as inspired as they went forward with games that really saved the whole civilization in this way .
well , we can do that .
we &apos;ve played warcraft since 1994 .
it was the first strategy game in real time of the world series of warcraft . that was 16 years ago .
so , given for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
they had half the civilization to go for a new world . that &apos;s where i have 21 billion hours a week of games .
we spent half of us passing an hour a day playing games to solve problems in the real world .
i know you &apos;re asking yourself , &quot; how are we going to solve problems in the real world in games ? &quot; well , i &apos;ve spent my work in the last few years at the institute for <unk> .
we have this poster in our offices in palo alto and express our vision of how we should relate to the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the result of the best stage in one case , and then we encourage people to actually make that result .
we want to imagine <unk> wins , and then give people the means to make fun <unk> .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i &apos;ve done that are an attempt to give people the media to create <unk> gains in their future .
this is &quot; world without <unk> . &quot;
we did this game in 2007 .
this is an online game where you &apos;re trying to survive a oil droplet .
oil <unk> is <unk> , but we put enough online content there to create that it &apos;s real and live their real lives as if oil was finished , and so , when you go into the game , they tell us where they live , and then we get news in real @-@ time sources that show you exactly how much oil you have , how life is going to live , and how it affects the transportation .
we did a hospital with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we followed them for three years .
and i can tell you , it &apos;s a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change the way of life , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
but if you immerse them in a epic adventure and says , &quot; we are running out of oil . &quot;
this is an amazing story and an adventure to help you out .
tell yourself to survive in that world . a lot of players have been keeping their habits in this game .
so , for the next game that we <unk> the world , we decided to aim higher , a bigger problem for oil .
we did a game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for <unk> .
the premise was that a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the world extinction system , of course .
we asked people to build online , almost like a jerry <unk> movie .
you know , in the jerry <unk> movies , they form an ideal team . they have the astronaut , the scientist , the former <unk> , everybody has something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people in the ideal team , we said , they &apos;re all in the ideal team , and it &apos;s your goal to invent the future of energy , the future of food , health , the future of security and the social safety network .
we had eight thousand people play that game for eight weeks .
there were 500 creative solutions that could go in and see if it were &quot; <unk> . &quot;
finally , the last game . we &apos;re launching march 3 . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you end the game , you will be certified by the institute of world bank , as a social <unk> , class 2010 .
working with the universities of all sub @-@ saharan africa , and we are trained to learn social innovation skills .
we have a graphic novel . we have <unk> in skills like local knowledge , networks of knowledge , sustainability , vision and invention .
i would like to invite all of you to share , please , this game with young people all over the world , in particular areas of development that might benefit from the union to try and start imagining their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to take you now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think it &apos;s going to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have all these games that are the drivers of what could be done , but no one has yet saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are a human resource that we can use in real world jobs that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these <unk> superpowers , the ability to cast a solid social plot , this feeling of urgent optimism , and the desire for <unk> purpose .
i really hope that together we can play games that we play , to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll join me and play games like this .
when i look at the next decade , i know two things about security : we can make any future we imagine , and we can play all sorts of games that we hate .
so i say , let &apos;s start the games that change the world .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i took a few months while writing an article for the italian editing of wired magazine .
i always have my hand @-@ <unk> dictionary when i &apos;m writing something , but i had finished editing my article when i realized that i never in my life had ever looked for the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what .
let me read you what it says .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , injured , injured , <unk> , traumatized , haunted , haunted , haunted , haunted , haunted , haunted , haunted , haunted , traumatized , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of nerves , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , healthy , strong , able . &quot;
i was reading this in a high voice to a friend , and at first i was laughing , i was so ridiculous , but i had just read &quot; <unk> , &quot; when my voice broke and i had to stop and get rid of the emotional crash and the impact that these words <unk> .
you know , of course , this was my old @-@ fashioned <unk> . i thought it had to be an old , clear editing .
but , in fact , it was an issue in the early 1980s when i had to be starting the elementary school and getting a sense of myself outside the family core and relationship to the other kids and the world around me .
and , needless to say , thank god i didn &apos;t use a <unk> at that time .
i mean , according to this definition , i would seem to be born in a world that would remind me that someone like me had absolutely no positive to give , when , in fact , i &apos;m currently famous for the opportunities and adventures that my life has given me .
so , immediately i went to look at the online edition of 2009 , hoping to find a worthy review of being considered .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this word .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; particularly <unk> , &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just a question of words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we talk to them with these words .
it &apos;s about values behind words , and how we build those values .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world , and how we see others .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the greeks and roman , believed that a damn <unk> was very powerful , because he <unk> out loud .
so , what is the reality that we want to create , the one person that is limited , or the one person who has control over itself ?
by the mere fact of doing something as simple as a name of a person , a child , we might be able to stand up and develop its capacity .
wouldn &apos;t we want , instead , let &apos;s face it ?
such a person , who opened my door , was my childhood doctor at the institute , <unk> , <unk> .
his name is dr. <unk> . an american of italian origin , whose name apparently , was too difficult to <unk> for most of his fellow americans , so he would make him <unk> just dr. p.
and dr. b always wore very colorful <unk> and he had the perfect fitness to work with kids .
i enjoyed most of the time i spent in the hospital , except for my <unk> sessions .
i had to do what appeared to me with these thick rubber bands -- different colors -- you know , to help strengthen my leg muscles , and i hated these gangs more than anything else . i hated them , i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and , you know , i was <unk> , only five years old , with dr. p to try and stop doing these exercise , no success , of course .
and , one day , she came to my session -- <unk> and <unk> , and she said , &quot; oh , aimee , you &apos;re such a tough , so powerful , i think you &apos;re going to break up one of those bands .
when i eat it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple <unk> part of dr. p for getting me to do the exercises that i didn &apos;t want to do before the possibility of being the five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the second floor room , but what he actually did for me was transforming a daily event that was horrible in a standard experience for me .
and i have to ask myself today , how far your vision is , and having given me a strong , powerful , <unk> girl , shape my vision of myself in the future as a strong , strong , powerful , athletic girl .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can turn the energy of a child .
however , in the definitions of <unk> that we previously saw , our language cannot allow us to develop into the reality that we all want , the possibility that one person can see itself as capable .
our language has not been put together with the changes in our society , many of which have been caused by technology .
certainly , from a medical perspective , my legs , laser surgery to improve vision , the implants of knee and hip made out of titanium in mature people , all of which are enabling people to develop more their own schools , and move beyond their own boundaries that nature has imposed them , not to mention the social networking platforms , which allow people to create their own communities .
so , maybe the technology is giving us now more clearly what has always been a truth , which each person has a little bit of common to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is the biggest advantage we have .
the human ability to adapt , which is an interesting thing , because people have constantly wanted to talk to me about overcoming the odds , and i &apos;m going to admit something . that phrase never stuck with me , and i always felt uncomfortable trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m beginning to realize why .
implicit in this phrase of <unk> , there is the idea that success , or happiness , is going through a <unk> challenge or not being affected by the experience , as if my successes in life were the result of a life @-@ <unk> ability to fight or <unk> the difficulties of a whole life with what other people feel like my disability .
but in fact , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re affected , of course , by a challenge , to be physical , emotionally , or both ways .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adversity is not a barrier that we need to be around so we can take our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of this as being my shadow .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and certainly , i &apos;m not trying to minimize the impact , weight , the fight of a person .
there are adversity and challenges in life , and it &apos;s a different reality for every person , but the question is not whether you &apos;re going to or not have to confront adversity , but how you &apos;re going to face .
so , our responsibility is simply not to isolate the adversity from those who we want to , but to make sure that it &apos;s okay .
and we don &apos;t do them any favors our children when we make them feel they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
there &apos;s a big difference between the objective medical fact that i have the <unk> legs and the subjective opinion of society about whether i am or not disabled .
and , frankly , the only real and consistent disability that i &apos;ve had to deal with is that the world would think those definitions describe me .
in our desire to protect those who we love giving them the hard and cold truth about their medical forecast or a life @-@ quality forecast that they might expect , we need to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick into a wall that ultimately <unk> someone .
perhaps the existing model of just looking at what &apos;s damaged in you and how to fix it , causes the most disability than pathology in itself .
when we &apos;re not trying to deal with the person in their totality , by not recognizing their potential , we &apos;re creating another evil about any natural struggle that can already have .
we &apos;re putting a score on the value that someone has for our community .
so we need to look beyond pathology and within the range of human capacity .
and more importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those <unk> and our greatest creative skill .
so , it &apos;s not about underestimate , or deny , those moments of greater test like something that we want to avoid or hide , but rather than that , it &apos;s about finding those opportunities that are hidden inside of adversity .
so , maybe , the idea i want to say is , not so much the overcome of adversity , but the <unk> of it , <unk> , <unk> with it , to use a term of the professional struggle , maybe even with it .
and perhaps , if we look at adversity as something that is natural and consistent and useful , we &apos;ll be less for their presence .
this year , we celebrate the 200 years of the birth of charles darwin , and 150 years ago , when he was writing about evolution , darwin started mapping , i think , a truth about the character of human beings .
to make it expensive , it &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , it &apos;s not the most intelligent one who survives , but also the one that fits better in change .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , among others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and thrive is propelled by the fight of the human spirit through conflict and towards transformation .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human ability .
and maybe it &apos;s not until we &apos;re <unk> , we know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe this is what adversity gives us , a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give us a gift .
we can rethink adversity as something more than just difficult times .
maybe we can see it as a change .
adversity is just a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created is the idea of normal .
tell me , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal stuff .
there &apos;s the common thing . there &apos;s the usual . there &apos;s no normal thing . and , would you like to meet those poor people , if they existed ?
i don &apos;t think .
if we can change this paradigm and move from one that seeks normal to another possibility , or strength , to be a little more risky , we can release the power of so many other kids , and invite them to put the service of the community those strange and valuable skills that they own .
anthropologists tell us that what , as humans , is that we have always wanted by the members of our community , is that they are useful .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , <unk> their elders , and those with severe physical injuries , perhaps because the experience of survival in the life of these people proved to be value for the community .
they didn &apos;t see these people as being damaged or useless ; they were seen as little as commonplace .
a few years ago , i was at a food market in the village where i grew up in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a commodity pack .
it was summer . i had short pants .
i hear this guy talking behind me saying , &quot; well , if this guy is not aimee . &quot;
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
and i say , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , do we know ? i don &apos;t remember . &quot;
and he says , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think you remember when i met .
i mean , when we met , it was washed off the belly of your mother . &quot;
oh , that person .
and of course , there i noticed .
it was dr. <unk> , whom i knew only through the stories that my mother would tell me about that day , because , of course , as he &apos;s normally in me , i came two weeks later to my birth .
so my mother &apos;s <unk> had gone on holiday , so the man who made my birth was a complete stranger for my parents .
and , because i was born without the bones of the <unk> , and i had the feet attached to it , and a few fingers on this foot , and a few in this one , he had to be who &apos;s carrying , this strange guy had to be the bad news .
he said , &quot; i had to give you the forecast to your parents that you would never forget , and that you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids had or any kind of independent life , and you &apos;ve been given me as a liar ever since . &quot;
the amazing thing is , he told me that he had saved newspaper cuts throughout my entire childhood , whether off the back of the day i won a power competition on a second grade , and he was <unk> with the <unk> , you know , at the <unk> parade , when i won my college scholarship , or any of my duty , and i &apos;m using this material , and i cut out of his students with these kinds of the <unk> out of the kinds of <unk> , and i &apos;m going to the kinds of
and he called this part of the course , the <unk> x , the potential of the human will .
no forecast can determine how powerful this can be as a key to the quality of a person &apos;s life .
and dr. <unk> kept saying to me , &quot; in my experience , unless you give him a lot of times the opposite , and even if you just give him minimal support , if you stop him from himself , a child will only get the success . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> made that change of thought .
he understood that there is a difference between the health problem and what a person can do despite the same .
and i myself have changed my thinking of time , because , if i had asked myself when i was 15 years old , if i would have changed my legs of meat and bone , i would not have <unk> or for a second .
and at that time , he <unk> that kind of normal .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences that i &apos;ve had with them , not despite the experiences that i &apos;ve had with them .
and , perhaps , this change in my mind has happened because i &apos;ve been in contact with more people who have been <unk> to me than who have been <unk> and shadows on me .
you know , all you need is a person opening your eyes to your own power , and you take off .
if you could give someone the key to their own power , the human spirit is so <unk> , if you could do that and open a door to someone at a pivotal moment , you &apos;re <unk> in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching yourself to open doors .
in fact , the exact meaning of the english word &quot; <unk> &quot; comes from the root &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means , stimulate what &apos;s inside , manifest the potential .
so , again , what is the potential that we want to focus on ?
there was a case study done in britain , in the 1960s , when it was changing the income system at high school , one that required income test for another which was open .
that &apos;s what they call the testing of separation in groups . here in the united states , we call it <unk> .
it &apos;s about separating students from a , b , c , etc .
and the students a get the toughest curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took students from d level , and over a three @-@ month period , they gave them the highest notes , they told them they were high @-@ level students , they said they were brilliant , and at the end of that three @-@ month period , they were <unk> to an a.
and , of course , the <unk> <unk> of this study , is that they took students from level a , and they said they were at the level .
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three @-@ month period .
with those who were still in school , in addition to those who had already left .
a crucial part of this case study was that teachers were also fooled .
teachers didn &apos;t know that there was a change .
they just told them that these were the students a , and these were the students , d. and that &apos;s how they were encouraged to teach them and to hate them .
so , i think the only real disability is a <unk> spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been <unk> has no hope . it doesn &apos;t see beauty . it &apos;s no more our natural curiosity , child and our innate ability to imagine .
if , instead , we can <unk> a human spirit to have hope , to see beauty in itself and others , so it &apos;s imaginative , then we &apos;re really using our power .
when a spirit has these qualities , we &apos;re able to create new realities and new ways of being .
i would like to leave you with a poem by a persian poet in the 17th century , named <unk> of who told me my friend , jacques <unk> . and the poem is called &quot; god who knows only four <unk> . &quot; every child has known to god , not the god of all the different names , not the god of what you can &apos;t do , but the god of the words that you see with me , and the other words , but only can &apos;t do with me , but the other words ,
come up and dance with me . thank you .
would you like to be better than that ?
suppose you said that , with only a few changes in your genes , you could improve your memory -- for a more precise , more accurate , more accurate and faster .
or maybe they would like to be better shape , be stronger , to have more resistance .
would you like to be more attractive and confident ?
how about living with good health ?
or maybe it &apos;s those people who always wanted to be more creative .
what else would you like ?
what would you like , if you could choose something ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
hands up . let me see .
few . probably because of the number of creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose the memory ?
a few more .
and the physical state ?
a little less .
how about longevity ?
oh , most of them . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
if you could have some of this , the world would be very different .
is it just imagination ?
or maybe it &apos;s possible ?
evolution has been a theme here at ted conference , but today i want to look at a doctor &apos;s stare at the subject .
the great 20th @-@ century geneticist , <unk> <unk> , who also <unk> in the most unorthodox church , wrote a essay called &quot; nothing in biology makes sense to the light of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re from those people who are not going to accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a good time to turn off the hearing aids , remove the personal communication devices -- i give you <unk> , and maybe , let &apos;s turn out the book of <unk> on being wrong , because , none of the rest of this talk is going to make a little sense to you .
but if you really accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just the past , or the future ?
does it matter to others or us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
so , in that picture , i put a bush in the center , which is set up in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every kind of existing species on the back of those branches has been successful in evolutionary terms , it has survived ; it has shown an adaptation to its environment .
the human part of this branch , well at one end , of course , the most interesting thing to do .
it came from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some of them have gone and back .
we &apos;ve been here for a few years .
it may seem that we &apos;re very far from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , mostly the basic machinery of our cells is about the same .
do you realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the insulin protein that &apos;s used to treat diabetes ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein , chemically <unk> , which comes out of the pancreas .
and talking about bacteria -- do you realize that we all carry in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body ?
maybe 10 times more .
i mean , think -- antonio <unk> asks you what the self @-@ image -- do you think about bacteria ?
the gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , dark , wet . it &apos;s very <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to give them all the nutrients that they can want without effort in their part .
it &apos;s really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some sort of rush away .
but , on the other hand , we &apos;re a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life .
they help digest essential nutrients , and they protect us from certain diseases .
but what &apos;s the future ?
are we in a sort of evolutionary equilibrium like a species ?
or should it be destined to become something different , something that is probably better adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s take a step back in time , to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of proto @-@ life may perhaps be three to four billion years ago in the <unk> , maybe about 800 billion years ago , and then the human species that finally appears at the last 130 billion years .
in this vast <unk> symphony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief compass ; the animal kingdom , like one and only <unk> , and human life , a little note of grace .
that was us .
and it was also the neat part of this talk , so i hope you enjoyed it .
when i first got to college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something fundamental : most of the existence of life , in the one @-@ celled organisms , each cell just divides and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters .
but when organisms appear , things start to change .
it comes into the sexual reproduction .
and something very important : the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens in the genome , the rest of the body becomes <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the body &apos;s death penalty will come into evolution in the same time of sexual reproduction .
i have to claim that when i was a college student , i thought , well , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex ; it seemed quite reasonable at the time , but every year i &apos;d spent , i was more convinced .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns , which was still acting in las vegas well in his 90s .
and one night , someone grabs his hotel door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , there &apos;s this wonderful , <unk> dancer from his clothes .
he looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a sex soup . &quot;
&quot; okay , &quot; george , &quot; i pick the soup . &quot;
i realized , as a doctor , who was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily counterintuitive , just different .
he was trying to preserve the body .
he wanted us to be healthy .
i wanted to get health into the disease .
i wanted us to live more and healthier .
evolution consists of passing the genome over to the next generation -- doubling and generation after generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are like a strengthening rockets designed to send the genetics to the next orbital level , and then let us fall to the sea .
i think everyone <unk> the feeling that woody allen when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
i want to make it not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily help longevity .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily help the biggest or the stronger or the faster and not even the smartest .
evolution favors the best @-@ adapted creatures .
that &apos;s the only proof of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the sub @-@ parts that it would produce , if there were fish there , <unk> medicine in the vacuum , yet they &apos;ve managed to make that a <unk> environment .
so , what does this mean , when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and if we start thinking about the place of humans in evolution and , in particular , if we look forward , to the next phase -- i would say there &apos;s a lot of possibilities .
the first is that they don &apos;t burn .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine , in the first place , we have learned a lot of genes that would otherwise have been <unk> and removed from the population .
and second , as a species , we have <unk> our environment so that it <unk> us as we adapt to it .
and by the way , by the way , <unk> , and we get so excited that it &apos;s not possible to have the isolation necessary to make evolution happen .
a second possibility is that there is a evolution of traditional , natural type , defined by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be : the gears of evolution roll it down slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and as soon as the isolation : when as a sort of distant planets are going to exist , the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , intriguing and terrifying possibility .
i call it the neocortex , the new evolution , which is not simply selected , but by us as individuals in the decisions we &apos;re going to take .
now , how could this happen ?
how could we get to do this ?
first , consider the reality that many people today , in some cultures , are making decisions about their offspring .
in some cultures , they &apos;re choosing to have more boys than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily a good thing for society , but it &apos;s what you choose at the individual level and family level .
think also , if it were possible to choose not only sex of their offspring , but in their own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease .
what if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating <unk> ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if you look into the future , that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> million dollars .
the next year of being done , in 2004 , i could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months .
today , you can get a complete sequence of 3,000 million base pairs in the human genome at a cost near the $ 20,000 and in a week .
don &apos;t make a lot of money for the human genome to be done for 1,000 dollars , and it will be increasingly within reach .
just a week ago , the national academy of engineering awarded his nobel prize <unk> to francis arnold and <unk> , two scientists who developed techniques independently to make the evolutionary process work faster and encourage <unk> proteins in a much more efficient way -- what <unk> calls &quot; evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the <unk> prize was awarded to the scientific establishment by its research in which he took a adult skin cell , a <unk> , and only four genes <unk> that cell becomes a <unk> stem cell : a able , in power , any cell in the body .
those changes come .
the same technology that &apos;s produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves , they &apos;re going to be sending out immunity against other viruses .
believe it or not , there is an experimental trial underway with the flu vaccine against <unk> flu cells in tobacco plants .
can you imagine anything good about tobacco ?
that &apos;s actually today , and in the future it &apos;s going to be increasingly possible .
so imagine just another two small changes .
they can change the cells in their bodies , but if they could change the cells in their offspring ?
what if they could change sperm and <unk> , or change the <unk> <unk> , and give their kids a better chance of a healthier life , eliminating diabetes , cutting out the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier kids ?
and then , that same analytical technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to adopt super @-@ attributes -- a better memory .
why not have the ingenuity of a ken jennings put on everything if you could hit the next generation of watson ?
why not have a push muscle faster than we can run faster and faster ?
why not live longer ?
this is going to be freaky .
and when we &apos;re in condition of <unk> this to the next generation , and we can assume that we want to turn evolution back into the neocortex .
we &apos;re going to take a process that would typically take 100 thousand years , and we can charge it to 1,000 years , and maybe it &apos;s within the next 100 years .
these are choices that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have them .
are we going to use these choices in terms of a better , more successful , more successful society ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others ?
are we going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust ?
this is the kind of question we &apos;re going to have to face .
and most profound of all , are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these decisions wisely ?
for good or for bad , and before you might think about it , these choices are going to depend on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a robot that could take you and give you hate skills or whatever it makes wheelchair users come up and walk again .
we call these robots , <unk> .
it &apos;s nothing different than something you put in the morning , it gives a big force , which also increases its velocity , and helps it , for example , to handle balance .
it &apos;s actually the true integration of man and machine .
but not only that -- it can integrate and connect it to the universe and with other things outside .
this is not an unreal idea .
to show you now what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldier who , on average , has to carry a 45 @-@ pound load , and he &apos;s still getting more equipment .
obviously , this leads to some very important complications -- back in the back , 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> damage .
we decided to contemplate this challenge and create a <unk> that could help handle the issue .
let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or let &apos;s call it the human <unk> .
soldiers : with the <unk> <unk> , i can save 80 pounds of terrain for so many hours .
its flexible design , it enables you to fit into a lot of <unk> and perform movement with a lot of agility .
it feels what i want to do , or where i want to go , and then it increases my strength and my resistance .
we &apos;re ready , with our industrial partner , to produce this device , this new <unk> , this year .
i mean , it &apos;s a reality .
let &apos;s go back now to the wheelchair users , what i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people around , in wheelchair chairs , around the world .
like one percent of the total population .
and this is a really conservative calculation .
we talk about something that often happens , very young people , who have damage to the column that when they start their lives -- 20 , 30 or 40 years old -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice .
we also talk about the aging population that &apos;s blown away very quickly .
his only choice , many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair .
and this has been the case for the last 500 years , from its successful emergence , as i should recognize .
so , we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility .
let me introduce you to the <unk> that &apos;s using amanda <unk> , who 19 years ago had a lesion in the column , and as a result he couldn &apos;t walk again for 19 years , until now .
thank you .
so amanda is using our <unk> , which mentioned .
it has some sensors .
completely non @-@ invasive on the crutches that send signals to the computer on board , here on the back .
also , here are some batteries that give energy to the engines on the hips , and on the knees , and move it forward to this very smooth , very natural gait .
i was 24 years old on the top of my life when , for a strange jump in the air , skiing down is paralyzed .
in a fraction of a second , i lost all sensation and all the way to the pelvis down .
shortly after that , a doctor came into my room in the hospital , and he said , &quot; amanda , you never walked . &quot;
that happened 19 years ago .
so he robbed me up to the last <unk> of my being .
the <unk> technology , since then , has allowed me to learn how to fix it , is to go underwater , climb rocks and even riding a hand .
but they haven &apos;t invented anything that enables me to walk , so far .
thank you .
as you can see , we have technology , we have the platforms for sitting and talking to you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just from soldiers , but amanda , and all wheelchair users , everyone .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called robin <unk> .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m running fires like a captain &apos;s <unk> in a volunteer body .
and , in our city , where volunteers have trained a highly skilled staff , you have to get to the site very soon enough to get into action .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the site , so i had a fairly high probability of going .
but there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and find out what our task was .
when i found the captain , i was in a conversation with the owner who certainly went through one of the worst days of his life .
we were in the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , <unk> , while her house was on fire .
the other volunteer who had just arrived before me , <unk> <unk> <unk> came first to the captain and he asked her to come in and join the dog at home .
the dog ! i was so <unk> !
there was a lawyer or a money <unk> , which , for the rest of his life , would have to tell the people who walked into a burning building to save a single living because it won me for five seconds .
well , i was the following .
the captain made me a <unk> .
he said , &quot; bezos , i need somewhere in the house .
i need you to come up , grab the fire , bring this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
it wasn &apos;t exactly what i expected , but i went -- i put the stairs in the end of the hall , i went to the real fire that at the very height or so they had just finished turning the fire , and i went into the main room for a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i took my burden back up the ladder where i met my <unk> and the lovely dog at the front door .
we took out of the house , the <unk> for the owner of the house where , as was to wait , his treasure , he got much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort to save his house .
the kindness she &apos;s observing for the other thing was that someone had even reached a pair of shoes .
both in my calling in robin <unk> , as in my wolf , i am a volunteer witness of the acts of generosity and kindness in a monumental scale , but also of grace and individual acts .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
everything has its importance .
so , when i look in this room to people who &apos;ve managed , or they &apos;re about to get , remarkable success levels , i would like to remind you this : no wait .
don &apos;t wait to win the first million to make a difference in someone &apos;s life .
if you have something to give , you will understand now .
we ate food in a dining hall , put in a neighborhood park .
be mentors .
not every day , we &apos;re going to have a chance to save someone &apos;s life , but every day we &apos;re going to be able to influence someone &apos;s life .
so , come in to the game , save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;ve just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women have the baton , practice sex to say hello , and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not the hot man or san francisco festival .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
this is the world of the wild bonobos ?
the bonobos are , along with chimpanzees , their closest living relatives .
that means we all share a common ancestry , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve made a lot of focus on this aspect of human evolution .
but the bonobos now show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees are dominated by large , terrifying guys , the bonobo is in charge of females with power .
these guys have created something special , because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence has not yet been observed .
but unfortunately , the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes .
they live in the deep sea in the jungle , and it &apos;s been very difficult to study them .
the congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the <unk> itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has gone down for decades and causing almost as many deaths as the first world war .
it &apos;s no wonder that this destruction also <unk> the survival of the bonobo .
the trade of hunting and deforestation is that you can &apos;t fill in a stadium with the bonobos . and honestly , we &apos;re not safe from it .
however , on this land of violence and chaos , you can hear something hidden by the trees .
who are these cousins ?
we know them like apes , do love , not war , because they have frequent sex , <unk> and bisexual people to handle conflict and solve social problems .
i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity , given that the life of the bonobo is more than the <unk> .
the bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire life .
playing is not just a game of kids .
for us and for them , play is fundamental to create ties and encouraging tolerance .
we learn to trust him , and we learn the rules of play .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look at the bonobo , you see the evolutionary roots of laughter , dance and ritual .
the game is the glue that binds us .
i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild .
first , it &apos;s a bonobo @-@ shaped game ; i don &apos;t talk about soccer .
here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a chase .
look what she &apos;s doing .
it could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase : &quot; he &apos;s in charge of the balls . &quot;
i just think in this case he loves it , right ?
yes .
so , sex play is both common with bonobos and humans .
and this video really is interesting , because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the bringing weird elements to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> -- and at the same time , it &apos;s all fun .
but play is <unk> .
the game is <unk> , it can adopt many forms , some of which are more <unk> , <unk> , curious -- maybe the place where you get to wonder .
and i want you to see -- this is <unk> , a young woman , who &apos;s playing with <unk> water .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner , outer worlds .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity .
these are just little samples of the understanding that the bonobo gives us from our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with creativity and greater cooperation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capabilities .
in other words , play is our <unk> of adaptation .
to successfully adapt to a world that changes we need to play .
but do we really enjoy our game capacity ?
play is not <unk> .
play is essential .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just cruel and <unk> .
when it seems the least appropriate to play , it can be the moments where it &apos;s most urgent .
so , our primates , let &apos;s accept this gift of evolution and play together while preserving creativity , friendship and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two partners in 1979 , on the same day , exactly at the same time , every single baby girl . okay .
so , two partners each with a baby .
i don &apos;t want you to be arrested too much in the details of conception , because if you stop thinking about conception , yes , you &apos;re not going to pay attention .
let &apos;s think about that for a moment .
and on this stage , i want you to imagine that , in a case , the sex chromosome joins the x @-@ chromosome .
and in another case , the x @-@ chromosome joins the x @-@ chromosome of the egg .
both <unk> and life begins .
we &apos;ll come back and talk about them later .
in my ground , i play two roles .
in one of my roles , i work with the history of the anatomy .
i &apos;m <unk> by training , and what i study in this case is the way that people are <unk> the anatomy -- that is , of human bodies and <unk> , how they &apos;ve considered the body fluid , the idea of the body ; what they &apos;ve thought about the body .
the other role that performance in my work is an activist , like <unk> of patients , or , as i say sometimes , i &apos;m going to argue that these are medical patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people whose physical features challenge challenge social norms .
i &apos;ve been working , for example , with identical twins , two people inside one body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> ; people are much lower than the average .
and i &apos;ve been working with a lot of examples of people with sex , individuals whose physical <unk> don &apos;t fit into male and female schemes .
in general lines , we can <unk> .
<unk> feeds many forms .
i &apos;m going to give you a few examples of ways to have sex that doesn &apos;t fit into the mainstream or female forms .
for example , there &apos;s the case of the individual <unk> <unk> , whose gene is <unk> from the y chromosome , says to the <unk> , which we all have in our lifetime , <unk> , <unk> .
and then , in <unk> life , testicles produce testosterone .
but because this individual lacks testosterone receptors , the body does not react to the same .
it &apos;s <unk> syndrome .
so , there are high levels of testosterone , but no reaction .
as a consequence , the body develops following a typically female course .
when the baby &apos;s born , the baby looks like a child .
he &apos;s a girl . he &apos;s raised as a child .
and , often , it &apos;s not until puberty , when it &apos;s growing and developing breasts , but it doesn &apos;t have the <unk> period , when you realize something &apos;s happening .
then , after doing tests , they realize that instead of having a bar and a uterus , it actually has testicles and a y.
the important thing to understand is that you can think it &apos;s a man , but it &apos;s actually not .
women , like the men , we have in the body something called the <unk> gland .
they &apos;re in the back of the body .
<unk> silk glands yield <unk> , the <unk> hormone .
most women like me -- i consider a typical woman ; she doesn &apos;t know her structure <unk> ; i think she &apos;s a typical woman , most women like me , are sensitive to the <unk> .
we produce <unk> and respond to <unk> .
as a consequence , someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who has the <unk> syndrome .
so sex is something complicated . it &apos;s not that <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum -- in a way they can be everywhere .
another example : a few years ago , i received a call from a 19 @-@ year @-@ old boy who was born and raised as a male boy , and he had sex with her , and he had a life like a child , and he had just discovered that he had <unk> and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of disease known as <unk> <unk> .
it had 20th chromosome , and in the womb -- the <unk> silk is so active that , essentially , created a male hormone environment .
as a consequence , his <unk> were <unk> , his brain was exposed to the normal hormone component .
he was born with a little bit of a child ; no one was <unk> .
and it was at the age of 19 when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> , when doctors discovered that , in fact , he was a woman inside .
well , another quick example of a <unk> case .
some people with 20th chromosomes develop what &apos;s known as <unk> , which is , you have tissue embedded in <unk> tissue .
we don &apos;t know why that happens .
so , there are many varieties of sex .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- that are dwarfs , <unk> twins , or <unk> , are sent to <unk> surgery , is not to be able to get rid of better physics .
in many cases , people are perfectly healthy .
the reason for various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories .
the system is typically based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings out a particular identity .
we have the idea that being a woman is supposed to have female identity ; supposedly , black means having african anatomy in historical terms .
a terribly simplistic idea .
and when we have a body that shows something quite different , we have problems with <unk> .
so we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk> .
our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born like two people in one body .
the most extreme case is last year with the south african <unk> <unk> <unk> , it was put in the fabric of his sex in the international berlin olympics .
a lot of reporters called to say , &quot; what &apos;s the test they &apos;re going to do to determine whether it &apos;s man or woman ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that there &apos;s no such test .
in fact , we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t trace a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> ; we are the ones that we draw that line .
so , what we have is a situation where the longer you go through science , the more you have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were stable trauma categories that were directly linked with stable categories are much more sophisticated than we thought .
and it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
also in terms of race , something which is much more complicated than the terminology .
as we see , we get into rough terrain .
let &apos;s look , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the dna with chimpanzees .
what do you think about the fact that they &apos;re doing in just a few <unk> ?
and as we move through science , we get more and more into a uncomfortable zone in which we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that we probably have are too <unk> .
and we &apos;re looking at this in all walks of human life .
one of them , for example , in our current culture , in the united states today , are the fights at the very beginning and at the end of life .
it &apos;s hard to set a moment from which a body gets human and it has different rights to the fetus .
there are very systematic discussions today -- not in public , but in fact , within the <unk> of when someone is considered dead .
our ancestors never had to marry this question of whether someone was dead .
as a lot of them put a feather in front of his nose , and if he was still <unk> him .
if he stopped moving it .
but we can , for example , extract vital organs from one body and put them in another body .
and , as a consequence , we have to address the dilemma of actually determine someone &apos;s death , and that puts us in a difficult situation where we don &apos;t have the simple categories of past .
and you might think that this supernova explosion could surprise someone like me .
in politics , i &apos;m progressive , <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit that it makes me nervous .
compare that these categories are a lot more <unk> than we thought i was tense .
closed off from the idea of democracy .
and to tell you about this tension first , i have to admit that i &apos;m a <unk> of the founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were big .
i mean , they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did , which i found every little bit of looking at that <unk> <unk> &quot; and not for music , which is totally <unk> .
that &apos;s why it happened in <unk> with the founding fathers .
the founding fathers , for me , the first activists of the anatomy and explain why .
what they practiced was a <unk> concept , and they <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years .
and , as all of us remember , what our founding fathers was the idea of the monarchy , and the monarchy was all about a very simplistic concept of the anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world did not know about dna , but they had clearly the idea of birth .
they had the concept of blue blood .
they were the idea that the political power was coming in from the right blood passed from the grandfather and then the son and so on .
founding fathers rejected that idea , and they started by a new <unk> concept , and that was that all men are created the same .
they <unk> the play field , and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common , and it wasn &apos;t the differences in anatomy . that was something very radical .
and partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were being destroyed .
it was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science .
and it &apos;s very clear , if you look at the history of founding fathers , that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a naturalist .
they were getting tired of supernatural explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of supernatural power that was transmitted by a vague idea of birth .
they were moving towards a naturalist .
and if you look , for example , the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as a result , they were passing the idea of the <unk> match .
and , by doing so , they were <unk> the foundations of the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but they did it for us , and it was cool .
and what happened years later ?
it happened that women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the concept of the founding fathers of which the coincidence was more important than the <unk> difference , and they said , &quot; the fact that we have a womb and bar is not a significant difference enough to <unk> the right to the vote , the right to a full citizenship , and so on . &quot;
and women were terrified .
then the success of the civil rights movement with people in the <unk> <unk> , saying , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we found men in the lines of civil rights movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of color who <unk> the coincidence of <unk> and , again , <unk> .
we see the same thing with the <unk> movement .
the problem is , of course , as we look at the coincidence , we have to start asking why we keep certain divisions .
but , attention , i want to keep some correlations in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t mean we should face the anatomy .
i don &apos;t mean that five @-@ year @-@ olds should be allowed to have sex or marry .
there are some divisions that make sense to me that we should keep .
but the challenge is trying to figure out what they are , why keep them , and if they make sense .
well , let &apos;s go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day .
imagine one of them , mary , was born three months before time : on june 1 of 1980 .
henry , on the other hand , he was born in the term : march 1 of 1980 .
by the only fact that he was born three months before mary was given all the rights of three months before henry -- the right to sexual consent , the right to voting , the right to <unk> .
henry has to wait for that , not because he &apos;s a different kind of biological age , but he was born after .
we found other <unk> in terms of their rights .
henry , as opposed to being considered a man , if i haven &apos;t told you whether he &apos;s <unk> , by virtue of being considered man , now he is overwhelmed by the <unk> who mary does not have to worry .
mary , on his side , does not have the same rights to marriage that henry in all states , for example .
henry can get married in every state with a woman , but mary can marry a woman just in some states .
so , there are still ethnic categories that are involved in various ways that are questionable and questionable .
and now the question is : what do we do now that science does so much in the field of the anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy might go ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes i feel like science is getting away .
where are we going ?
it seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
but a lot of people are stuck in a weird position .
for example , texas at some point has decided that to marry a man , you don &apos;t have to have y chromosome and get married a woman , you have to have y @-@ chromosome .
now , in practice , they don &apos;t do tests <unk> .
but this is also very strange , given the story that i told you about at the beginning of <unk> syndrome .
if you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , in his &quot; i <unk> <unk> &quot; offers a solution .
it says that we should address people , not based on the color of their skin , but in the content of their character , &quot; going beyond the anatomy .
and i mean , &quot; yes , the idea looks really good . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do you judge people based on the content of their character ?
i want to also point out that i &apos;m not sure that we need to be involved in this to force people &apos;s rights , because i have to admit that i know a few people who probably deserve more of the social services than some humans i know .
i also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that i know can make more intelligent decisions and intelligent and ripe about their sex relationships than people in 40 who i know .
so , how do you put the subject of character content ?
it &apos;s very difficult .
and one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could be in the future be measured by an instrument , maybe an mri .
do we really want to get there ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i do know is it seems to be very important that the united states is still running this <unk> of thinking in relation to the subject of democracy .
we &apos;ve done a good job in defense for democracy , and i think we &apos;re going to do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t live , for example , in a context like the iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being murdered , unless he &apos;s willing to have a sex shift , in which case he can live .
we &apos;re not in that situation .
i &apos;m glad to say we don &apos;t have a context like a surgeon who i spoke with a couple of years ago that i had made birth <unk> twins for then separate them and <unk> their fame .
but when i asked the phone , i asked him the reason for the operation was a very <unk> operation , he replied that in that other country , these kids would be very <unk> and therefore he had to do it .
what i said , &quot; well , has you considered the political asylum rather than the surgical separation ? &quot;
america offers huge possibilities for people to be who are unable to change by the well of the state .
so i think we have to be on our head .
well , in closing , i want to say that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about dads .
and i want to think about what democracy would be like , or how it might have been , if we &apos;d been more empowered to bring it up .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , which is that i think there can be different ideas coming from different backgrounds , especially if there are people thinking about group .
for years , since i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also been interested in finding sexual difference .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world .
and what we know about <unk> studies is that women , on average , not all , but in <unk> , tend to pay more attention to complex social relations and care about those who are <unk> inside the group .
and if we think about that , we have an interesting situation in our hands .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my consultants who knew that i was interested in feminism -- i was considered a feminist -- i was a strange question .
&quot; tell me what a female of feminism is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; it &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism has to do with getting rid of gender stereotypes , so there &apos;s no female in feminism . &quot;
but the more i &apos;ve thought about his question , the more i think there is something female in feminism .
i mean , there could be something , on average , something different between the female brain and the male brain that makes us more <unk> to complex social relations and willing to help the most vulnerable .
so , while the dads were very attentive , they were able to figure out how to protect the people from the state , it &apos;s possible that , if we were more supportive to this concept , maybe we would have <unk> the concept of protection with the reciprocal support .
and maybe that &apos;s what we need to do in the future when we celebrate democracy beyond the anatomy : to think less about the individual body , in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
so , while we &apos;re trying to create a more perfect union , let &apos;s think about what we do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my <unk> .
but before i show you what &apos;s inside , i &apos;m going to make a public confession , and that is , i &apos;m alive obsessed with suits .
i love finding , dress , and more recently , photograph and publish in my blog bold , colorful , different costumes for every time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
all my clothes is second hand in <unk> markets and second hand stores .
oh , thank you .
the second hand stores allow me to lower the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my wallet .
i get to know people who are going to succeed ; usually my money goes to a good cause ; my looks unique ; and buying turns into my personal search for <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
do you want the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are positive , then i feel like i &apos;ve won .
going back to the theme of my <unk> , i want to tell you what i want to say for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does it bring to someone who has all that clothes ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
i &apos;ve brought seven pairs of underwear inside , and nothing else .
underwear for exactly one week is all i &apos;ve put in my <unk> .
i figured it would be able to find everything else that i would like to use after i got here to palm springs .
and since they don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in underwear , that means i found some things .
and i &apos;d like to show you now the set for this week .
doesn &apos;t it sound interesting ?
while i do , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the lessons of life , believe it or not , i &apos;ve learned in this adventure of not using new clothing .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking good .
almost always , you can see great for less than 50 dollars .
the whole thing , the jacket , cost me 55 , and it &apos;s as expensive as i &apos;ve used in the week .
monday : the color is energy .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be healthy , when you &apos;re wearing a bright red .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to attract other happy people .
tuesday : integration is fixed .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk> .
i just know you .
if you get rid of the right people , you don &apos;t just understand them , you &apos;ll get scared .
wednesday : get the kid inside .
sometimes people say to me , it sounds like i play a lot of the <unk> , or i remember their little seven @-@ year @-@ old .
i like to tell you , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : trust is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good at something , it &apos;s almost certain you &apos;re .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good at something , it &apos;s probably true as well .
my mother taught me this day after day .
but it wasn &apos;t until the age of 30 that i really understood his meaning .
and i &apos;m going to explain it in a few seconds .
if you think you &apos;re a beautiful person in your inner and outside , there &apos;s no eyes that you can &apos;t attract .
so there &apos;s no excuse to anyone in this audience .
we have to be able to achieve everything we want to do .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth <unk> words for you : the gold <unk> go with everything .
and finally , saturday : developing a self @-@ personal , unique way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word .
i &apos;ve tried this over and over again , when people came up to me this week , just for what i was using . and we had fantastic conversations .
obviously all this is not going to go into my little <unk> .
so before i go home , to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to give it all away .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that you have to leave some things behind .
i don &apos;t have to physically <unk> these things , because , in the back of the corner , there will always be another crazy suit , shiny , and if there &apos;s a little love in my heart and i &apos;m looking .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon everybody .
i have something to show you .
think it &apos;s a <unk> , a flying <unk> .
in our lab , we call it sensitive design .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about this .
if you look at this picture -- i &apos;m from italian origin , all the children in italy grew up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom , but the reason i show you this is that something very interesting has happened in the racing race one in the last two decades .
so , some time ago , if you wanted to win a career in belgium , you would take a budget and you would go to a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , you would win the race .
but today , if you want to win a career , you need something like this too -- something that <unk> your car in real time , with thousands of sensors that deliver information and convey it to the system , and then use it to provide instructions to the car and change things in real time as information is released .
this is what , in engineering , real @-@ time control system .
it &apos;s essentially a system that has two components : a sensor and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is that real @-@ time control systems are starting to enter our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , have been covered with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re turning computers into the open air .
and , like that , they &apos;re starting to respond differently , and they can be copied and <unk> .
cities are big .
as a separate note , i wanted to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s crust , but they represent 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and even 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
if we could do something with cities , it would be a big thing .
beyond cities , all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects .
this is an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the late year at moma during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; cd to me . &quot;
well , our objects , our surroundings , begin to speak to us .
in a way , it &apos;s as though almost all of the existing atoms would become sensors and actuators .
and that &apos;s completely changing the interaction that humans have with the outside environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo .
you know , when michelangelo <unk> moses <unk> , he says he eventually took the hammer , and he threw it down in moses -- you can still see a little bio @-@ <unk> , and he says , &quot; <unk> , actually ? &quot;
well , today , for the first time , our environment begins to speak to us .
and i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples , insisting on the idea of capturing the environment and pushing something .
let &apos;s start with screening .
the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab .
this was four and a half years ago in italy .
what we did there was we used a new kind of network of that moment that had developed all over the world -- the <unk> phone network and <unk> information that was anonymous in that network , which was <unk> by the operator to understand how the city works .
it was a summer hopefully 2006 .
it was the year in italy that won the world cup .
maybe some of you remember him , he was playing italy and france , and at the end of the day , he gave the <unk> .
and anyway , he eventually won italy .
now let &apos;s look at what happened that day , looking at <unk> activity in the network .
here we see the city .
you see the coliseum in the middle and the river <unk> .
it &apos;s morning , before play .
the time line is at the top .
early afternoon , there are people over here and there doing calls , moving .
the game begins : silence .
<unk> from france . <unk> from italy .
<unk> ; people do a quick call and they go to the bathroom .
second time . end of time .
first extra time , second .
<unk> , and at a moment , <unk> .
win in italy , yes !
that night , everyone was celebrated the center .
there you see the big spike .
the next day , everyone was at the center of the winning team and the prime minister of that day .
and then the whole world went down .
you see the picture of the place called massimo circus where , since roman time , people are going to celebrate -- it &apos;s a great party , you can see the peak at the end of the day .
this is just an example of how we can now measure the pulse of the city in a way that we could not have done just a few years ago .
another quick example of detection : it &apos;s not about people , it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
today , we know everything about the input from our objects .
this is a map that shows all the chips that make a mac , how you assemble .
but we know very little about where things are going .
so in this project , we developed some little labels to track the garbage on its <unk> .
we started with some volunteers who helped us in seattle a little more than a year ago , to tag what they were throwing , different kinds of things , as you can see , things that were anyway .
then we put a little chip on them , a label , on the trash , and then we started <unk> .
these are the results from that .
from seattle .
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same thing with much less energy .
this is data that didn &apos;t exist before .
they &apos;re happening complicated things , and there &apos;s a lot of unnecessary transportation .
but the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup doesn &apos;t go away , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
if the plastic bottle that you throw a day is still there .
that if we show that to people , then we can promote some behavior change .
that was the reason for the project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could tell us a lot more about detection , and a lot of cool things we can do with that , but i wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning , which is to push it over the environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago at <unk> .
it all started with a question of the mayor of the city , which came to us and said that spain and south europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces , in architecture .
and the question was : how can technology , the new technology , add it to that ?
and one of the ideas that we developed at mit , in a workshop , was : imagine you have a <unk> and valves , valves , valves , and then you close .
it &apos;s created like a curtain of water , which is <unk> .
if the pixels can be written in them , show patterns , images , text .
and as you zoom in , the curtain will open so that we can pass , as you can see in the image .
we introduced this to the <unk> mayor .
he liked it a lot .
and we set up a commission to design the building at the entrance to the <unk> .
we call it the digital highway .
the whole building is made of water .
there are no doors and no windows , but when you &apos;re approaching , you can move .
the roof is also covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a little bit of wind , if you want to minimize the <unk> , the ceiling comes down .
or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears in this case .
those days will always be someone , in the winter , when the ceiling comes down , someone who was there and said , &quot; let &apos;s get the building . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not that they have ignored it , but when it comes down to almost all of the architecture goes away .
here it is working .
you see , you see people going in for what &apos;s going on inside .
and here i am myself trying to not get wet when i &apos;m testing the sensors that open the water .
i think i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
that night was really even more fun .
all the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit .
it was no longer a building that would open to leave you alone , but a building that was still <unk> and holes in water , and you had to jump in and not have to jump .
and for us that was very interesting because as architects , engineers , designers , we always think about the use that people will give our designs .
but then reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things to interact , that people use .
this is a picture of the building with the physical pixels , the water pixels side , and projections about them .
and this is what led us to think of the next project i &apos;m going to show you .
so , imagine that those pixels could start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter in the air , and every one had a little <unk> that changes color as if it were a cloud that moves in space .
this is the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one we saw before , moving with others in sync .
we could form this cloud .
a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions .
or normal , but in three dimensions , what changes is light , not the position of the pixels .
you can play a different type .
imagine that the screen appears at different scales and sizes , different kinds of resolution .
and then all of that could be a wall of <unk> in 3d , where you can zoom in and go through , and see from many different angles .
this is the real controlled <unk> , going down to form a v , like before .
when the light goes on , it looks like this . the same thing we saw before .
imagine each one of them being controlled by one person .
we can have every <unk> that comes from people , the movement of people , etc . , etc .
i want to show you something for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancer from today , the new york <unk> star and la <unk> to capture his movements in 3d and use them as inputs to the <unk> .
here we can see <unk> dancing .
on the left hand side , you see the pixels , it captures in different <unk> .
it &apos;s so much 3d visualization , in real time , like motion capture .
it can wash all the motion .
you can go all the way around .
and once we have the pixels , we can play with them , with color and motion , with gravity and rotation .
we want to use this as a possible entry into the <unk> .
i wanted to show you the last project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something for the london olympics .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
and the idea is , imagine again , that we could engage people in order to do something and change our <unk> environment as a barn @-@ raising , but with a cloud .
so imagine we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk> .
and i think the remarkable thing that &apos;s happened in the last few years is that , in the last two decades , we went from the physical world to the digital world .
we &apos;ve digitized everything , like knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible across the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign -- we can move it from the digital world , the self @-@ organizing power of networks , the physical world .
in our case , we might want to use it to design and make a symbol .
that would mean something built in a city .
but tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today : think of climate change or co2 emissions . how do we move from the digital world to the physical world ?
the idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made out of the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and those particles are water , while in our cloud , they are pixels .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it &apos;s covered in pixels .
you can move inside , have different experiences .
you can see it from the bottom , serving the main moments of the 2012 olympics and even more , and it can be used as a way of connection to the community .
so , it &apos;s both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can climb up , like a new top of london .
you can get in there .
as if he was a new digital <unk> at night , but the most important thing is it &apos;s going to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express humans not separate from nature and everything is connected .
i was for the first time to antarctica , almost 10 years ago , and i saw my first <unk> .
i was amazed .
my heart pounding , i was <unk> , trying to understand what was in front of me .
i <unk> them all around me -- it &apos;s almost 60 feet -- and i couldn &apos;t think it was a <unk> of snow about another snowflake every year after year .
the <unk> are born when it comes to the glaciers or cut off the ice walls .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some people refuse to give up and hold on to the end , while others can &apos;t help him anymore , and get in a dramatic passion <unk> .
it &apos;s easy to think , when we see an iceberg , that they &apos;re isolated and apart , largely like we see ourselves as humans .
but reality is the opposite .
as an iceberg melts , i &apos;m breathing your ancient atmosphere .
as an iceberg melts , it releases rich water in minerals that feed lots of life .
so , i &apos;m going to photograph these <unk> as if it comes to the portraits of my ancestors , knowing that at these unique moments , there will be no way again and will not exist again .
it &apos;s not death when it &apos;s broken ; it &apos;s not an end , but a course of its way through the life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> , which is very young -- has a couple of thousand years .
and another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
the last photos i &apos;d like to show you are from an iceberg that i photographed in <unk> , greenland .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> to really see a rolling iceberg .
here you go .
you can see the left a little boat .
it &apos;s about five meters .
and i would like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and their <unk> line .
you can see here , it starts rolling , the ship has moved to the other side , and the guy is standing there .
this is an iceberg in greenland , average size .
it stands at 120 feet or 40 meters .
this video is in real time .
and so <unk> , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
clearly , i &apos;ve been born into life with many amazing projects .
but the cool one i worked on was this guy .
the guy is called <unk> .
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> of the 1980s .
one day she came to her house after running , and she said , &quot; daddy , i feel a <unk> on my legs . &quot;
and that was the start of als .
today <unk> has a complete paralysis .
it can only use your eyes .
their work influenced me .
i have a design firm and animation company , so obviously , graffiti is something that is intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world .
so we decided that we were going to ask tony to come , <unk> , and his cause .
so i went in and met with his brother and his father and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give him this money .
what are they going to do with him ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and he &apos;s able to communicate with me . &quot;
and i said , &quot; a second , it &apos;s not like i &apos;ve seen stephen <unk> , isn &apos;t it that all the people with paralysis can communicate through those devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re an important person and have a very good insurance , you can &apos;t actually do it .
these devices are not affordable for people . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate then ? &quot;
anyone see the movie &quot; the <unk> and the butterfly ? &quot;
they communicate that way -- they &apos;re <unk> with their finger .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s <unk> . how can it be ? &quot;
so i came up with the only wish to give a check and instead i signed a check that i didn &apos;t have the least idea of how i was going to cover .
i get distracted by his brother and his father there at that very moment , &quot; ok , this is the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to build a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s ridiculous that someone who has so much inside can &apos;t get it . &quot;
so i spoke at a conference a couple of months later .
i met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> lab , who have a technology that lets them project a light on any surface , and then , with a laser pointer , they draw on that and register the negative space .
so they &apos;re going around doing art installations like this .
all the things that come up , they say , they &apos;re part of a life cycle .
they first start with sex organs , then with the bad words , then with bush attacks and , ultimately , people start doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so , i went home , and as i was dealing with my wife , i was telling him about this , and we said , &quot; if we know that there &apos;s the technology that allows you to use your eyes to control things , why we don &apos;t think a way we can actually control a laser to do graffiti again . it would be great . &quot;
and so the journey began .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of help things from side to side , we had achieved a couple of things .
one , we touch the doors of insurance companies , and we got a machine so that we could communicate , a machine like stephen hawking &apos;s <unk> .
which was great .
and , seriously , it &apos;s all fun , and i call it <unk> , because when you talk to the guy , you get an e @-@ mail from him , and you say , &quot; i don &apos;t deserve it . this guy is fantastic . &quot;
the other thing we did was we brought seven programmers from all over the world -- all the <unk> from all the <unk> to our house .
my wife , kids and i , we moved into the garage back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> , took over the house .
many of our friends thought we &apos;d do something completely stupid , and when <unk> would have taken away the frames of walls and instead there would be graffiti .
but for two weeks , we went to the <unk> ride , my son was part , my dog was also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and you can see the description .
they &apos;re a pair of cheap sunglasses that we buy at the <unk> beach <unk> beach , some copper wire and stuff at home at home .
we take a <unk> camera , we cut it , we put it together on an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free to build yourself , and we publish the code that &apos;s going down for free .
and we create a device that has absolutely no limitation at all .
there &apos;s no insurance company saying &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital i can say , &quot; no . &quot;
anyone with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicating using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much . that was amazing .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
i love this picture because this is the other person &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room .
there was this whole <unk> and <unk> during the big opening .
and then over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , intense sessions all night , tony went back to drawing for the first time in seven years .
and this is a wonderful picture , because this is the life support system , and it &apos;s looking through the life support system .
we rushed over to bed so i could see .
and we put a projector on a wall of the park outside the hospital .
and he went on to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking .
the funny thing was , we had to sit in the parking lot , so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti .
at the end of this he gave us an e @-@ mail and this is what he said to us , &quot; this is the first time he was drawing in seven years .
i felt like i had been underwater , and someone finally came to me and i was glad to get married . &quot;
isn &apos;t that wonderful ?
in a way , that &apos;s our scream at war .
that &apos;s what keeps us moving , developing .
and we have a long way to go with this .
it &apos;s a cool device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of a distorted screen .
someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and robust .
since then , we &apos;ve had all sorts of recognition .
we &apos;ve won a lot of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making money out of this .
everything comes out of our own pockets .
the prizes were the guy , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
armstrong supported something about us , and then , in december , time , time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 great inventions in 2010 , and it was really great .
best of all of this -- and this is what ends up closing -- is that in april this year in l.a. &apos; s <unk> at the center of los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; art in the streets . &quot;
&quot; art in the streets &quot; is going to have the best urban <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , all of them are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be in the show that &apos;s pretty cool .
so , basically , this is my idea : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
none of what &apos;s in this room was possible -- the stage , the computer , the microphone , the microphone -- nothing was possible at some point .
make it possible -- anything in this room .
i &apos;m not a programmer , i never did anything with eye recognition technology ; i just recognized something and help me with wonderful people so that i can make it happen .
and these are the questions that i want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like we have to do . if it &apos;s not now , when ? and if i &apos;m not , who ?
thank you guys .
you know what i do is write for kids , and indeed , i &apos;m probably the author of children , most read in america .
and i always tell people i don &apos;t want to look like a scientist .
i can claim it as a farmer , or with leather clothes , and no one has ever chosen a farmer .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and <unk> .
and you know , an epiphany usually is something that you fell somewhere .
you just have to turn the apple around and see it as an epiphany .
that &apos;s a picture of a circle .
a friend of mine did that -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of tricky circle i &apos;m going to talk to you .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s in the middle school , in <unk> , ohio where i was the freak out of the class .
that i <unk> to bleed every week to my children &apos;s bathroom , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me go into the <unk> of the teacher &apos;s room .
he was doing it in secret .
for three years .
and i had to leave the city .
i had a thumb , and 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- i found a lover -- and in the &apos; 80s , i felt the need to start working on organizations that were fighting aids .
about three or four years ago , in the middle of the night , i got a phone call from that teacher , the <unk> lady who said , &quot; i need to see you .
i &apos;m adults that we never get to know .
you could fly to ohio , and please bring that guy that i know you &apos;ve already found .
and i have to tell you that i have pancreatic cancer , and i would like you to be distracted by this . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we went to see it , we laugh , we cry , and we realized that she needed to be abused .
we found a place , we found it <unk> , and we looked at it and we commissioned her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and just like the woman who wanted to wake me up as a grown @-@ up , she became a <unk> box and was put in my hands .
and what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that i talked to you about was made in itself .
epiphany is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , my partner and i save her from her .
and you know that part of life needs everything the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m very happy that today talked a lot about this .
it also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our work to provide those things .
thank you .
so , imagine a big bang when you &apos;re 3,000 feet tall .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor doing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it sounds scary .
well , i had a one seat that day . i was sitting in the <unk> .
it was the only one that could talk to the flight assistants .
so i immediately looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem . you probably ate some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already cracked the plane , and we weren &apos;t so far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the aircraft <unk> the plane with the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the road .
i &apos;m going to use the motors .
imagine being on an airplane and without noise .
and then he said three words -- the three most <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he said , &quot; <unk> for impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more about the flying assistant .
i could see it in his eyes , it was terror . life is over .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about myself that day .
i learned that everything changes in a second .
we have this list of things to do before we die , these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to get there and didn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to fix , all the experiences that i &apos;ve wanted to have and never had .
as i was thinking about that later , i was a phrase , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m going to open it up .
i don &apos;t want to spend anything in life .
and that urgency , that purpose , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is while i was playing the bridge george washington , which was not for much -- i thought about , wow , i really feel a big deal .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
in my humanity and my mistakes , i have tried to improve anything i did .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego .
and i &apos;m sorry about the time that i &apos;m focused on things that i don &apos;t care about .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with the people .
and then , like <unk> on that , i &apos;m going to remove the negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
in two years , i haven &apos;t had a fight with my wife .
it feels like wonders .
i &apos;m no longer trying to be right ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is like your mental clock is ticking , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you see the water coming .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please fly . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this to break down into 20 pieces like you see in those documentaries .
and as i breathed down , i had the feeling of , wow , dying is not scary .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been working on it for all of our life .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness is a single thought , which is , i just wish for one thing .
i wish i could see my kids grow up .
a month later , i was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade , not so much artistic talent .
... still .
and i shout , yell , like a little one .
and for me , that was the whole reason of being in the world .
at that point , i understood , connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent .
above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good parent .
i was given a miracle , not dying that day .
and i was given another gift , which was the potential to look at the future and come back and live another way .
you &apos;re flying today , the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and please not be that way -- but imagine , how would it change ?
what would you do , which you still expect to do , because you think you &apos;re going to live forever ?
how would it change their relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and most importantly , are the best parents who can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the computer worm is actually very simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the nuclear bomb .
its biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the uranium <unk> plant .
the gray boxes that you see are real @-@ time control systems .
if we can engage these systems that control speeds and valves , we can cause a lot of problems with centrifuge .
the gray boxes don &apos;t use windows software ; they &apos;re from a completely different technology .
but if we can put a windows @-@ selling virus on a portable computer that &apos;s used by an engineer to set up this gray box , then we &apos;re ready .
this is the behind <unk> .
we started with a windows <unk> .
the <unk> enters the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian program is <unk> ; it &apos;s <unk> mission .
it &apos;s easy , eh ?
i want to tell you how we discover this .
when we started doing research on <unk> six months ago , the purpose was completely unknown .
the only thing that was known is that it &apos;s very , very complex at the windows part : the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities of the day @-@ to @-@ zero .
it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these control systems .
that really caught our attention , and we started an experiment where we filled our surroundings with <unk> and saw what was going on with this .
so they spent very strange things .
<unk> became like a laboratory rat where he didn &apos;t like our cheese : he smell it , but he didn &apos;t want to eat .
it didn &apos;t make sense for me .
and after experiencing different flavors of cheese , i realized , and i thought , &quot; this is a attack .
it &apos;s completely run . &quot;
the <unk> is seeking actively in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration , and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that location .
if not , <unk> does nothing .
so that called my attention , and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day , because i thought , &quot; we don &apos;t know what the goal is . &quot;
it could be , say , for instance , a u.s. energy plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
better than asking the goal soon .
so we pulled out and we pulled the attack code , and we found that it was structured in two digital bombs : a small one and a big one .
we also found that they were armed very professionally armed with people who obviously had all the information inside .
they knew all the points for attacking .
you probably even know how much the operator is .
so , you know everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that <unk> is complex and high tech , let me tell you , the payload is very complex .
it &apos;s very much above all we &apos;ve seen before .
here you see a sample of this attack code .
we &apos;re talking about around 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like the old <unk> language .
i want to tell you how we could find this code .
what we were looking at at at the beginning was called the functions of the system , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and trying to match the real world with potential goals in the real world .
we need theories about what we can pass or <unk> .
to get to theories about goals , we remember that it &apos;s definitely a violent <unk> , it &apos;s got to be a valuable white guy , and he &apos;s probably located in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections has been <unk> .
there are not many thousands of goals in that area .
it basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and <unk> plant of <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; let &apos;s have a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants among our clients . &quot;
i called them up , and i visited them in an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data .
and it worked pretty well .
so we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of rotor .
rotating is that cell phone inside the centrifuge , that black object you see .
if you &apos;re driving the speed of this rotating , you can actually recognize it and even make it <unk> .
what we also saw is that the goal of attacking was to make it slow and slow down in an obvious effort to go crazy to the nest maintenance engineers , so that they couldn &apos;t really resolve this very quickly .
we try to crack the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and the structures .
so , for example , <unk> number sticking out that code , you can &apos;t get away .
i started doing science literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and i found that they &apos;re <unk> in what &apos;s called a waterfall , and every waterfall is <unk> .
that made sense , there was a coincidence .
and he got better yet .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages .
and guess what do we find in attacking ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a good coincidence .
this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands .
so there was no misunderstanding , no way .
the results have been obtained after several weeks of hard work .
we had to go all the way down and we had to start again .
yet , we found that both digital <unk> attached to one single , same goal , but from different angles .
the little <unk> is taking a waterfall , and spinning these rotors and shaking , and the big <unk> is communicate with six <unk> and manipulating valves .
in sum , we &apos;re very confident that we have determined what the recipient is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
we don &apos;t have to worry about other goals being driven by <unk> .
so here i show you some really interesting things that we saw , i really got excited .
there &apos;s the gray box , and the top is called the <unk> .
so what this thing does is he <unk> the input values of sensors for example , of the pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provides legitimate code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
and believe it or not , this false entry data is <unk> by <unk> .
it &apos;s like in the hollywood movies where , during <unk> , the security camera is feeding video .
that &apos;s cool , huh ?
the idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the room of control .
it &apos;s really much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to <unk> a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast .
for example , in a power plant , when the big steam turbine comes up , you &apos;ve got to open up exhaust for a millisecond .
obviously , this cannot do a human operator .
that &apos;s where we need digital security systems .
and when they &apos;re engaged , then they can do bad things .
the plant can burst .
and you don &apos;t notice the <unk> or the safety system .
that scares it .
but it can be worse .
what i &apos;m going to say is very important .
think about this . this attack is generic .
it has nothing to do with it , specifically , with uranium <unk> .
it could also work , for example , in a power plant , or in a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to disseminate this burden with a usb key , as we saw in the case of <unk> .
you could also use conventional worms technology for <unk> .
let &apos;s make it as easy .
and if you do that , what you find is with a <unk> of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to deal with .
unfortunately , the greatest number of goals for such attacks is not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states and japan .
all the green areas are space @-@ driven spaces .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start preparing us now .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s taken public on many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this .
what &apos;s your opinion ?
ralph <unk> : okay , you really want to hear this ?
okay . okay .
my guess is that <unk> is involved , but the engine is not israel .
the engine behind this is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s one alone , and that &apos;s the united states , fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problems would be even bigger .
thank you for <unk> . thank you , ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years focusing on situations generally very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
it shot in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating only this -- fun at first , which is difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been sort of <unk> myself in situations where they are horrible with the only goal of looking at social issues in ways that are appealing , interesting , and hopefully measuring them in a way that will be seen and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew i &apos;d come here to do a tedtalk on the world of brands and patronage , i wanted to do something a little different .
so , some of you may have heard of it , or not , a couple of weeks ago , i took a ride on ebay .
i submitted some messages on facebook , some on twitter , which i offered for the rights of my tedtalk in 2011 .
so , some fortunate , a corporation , a nonprofit , was going to have the only chance in life asking chris anderson is not going to allow him to re @-@ buy the rights of the talk that you &apos;re seeing right now that chris had no title , and he didn &apos;t really understand what the topic would be .
so , what was the following : &quot; here , <unk> name shows : my tedtalk that you have no idea what it &apos;s all about and content could be shown in the face , especially if i put it ridiculous to you or your company doing it .
but with that , it &apos;s a very good news opportunity . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
it &apos;s a title for progress , by the way .
so even with that <unk> , i knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name .
if you had asked me a year ago , i could not have asked for sure .
but in the new film that i &apos;m working on , we examined the world of marketing , of advertising .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;ve been in horrible situations in the last few years , but nothing could make me ready , nothing could be <unk> , for something as difficult or as dangerous as i could get into the halls with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
i want to make a film that tries to deal with product <unk> , marketing and advertising , and that the whole film is all about products and marketing and advertising .
the movie is going to be called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what happens in &quot; the greatest movie ever <unk> , &quot; is that everything from the top down , in the beginning , has <unk> images , all the time , from the <unk> that appears before the title , the x @-@ ray .
now this brand , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center .
these people <unk> the film to <unk> -- forever .
and so , the film explores all this idea . is it what ? is it <unk> , forever ?
i &apos;m a storyteller .
it was more emphasis .
it was &quot; a <unk> . forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the x @-@ files , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to get all the categories that we can in the film .
maybe you &apos;ll get a shoe , and you get the coolest shoe that you &apos;ve used ...
the most cool car you have in &quot; the biggest film you &apos;ll ever drink , &quot; the best drink you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the idea is then to show the brands as part of life , to make them <unk> the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in this movie .
that &apos;s the whole idea , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love you to help make it happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny because it &apos;s the first time i hear that ; it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
however , i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t know if &quot; angle &quot; is too stubborn , but you know how it &apos;s going to crash ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
a million and a half .
i think it &apos;s going to be difficult to meet them , but it &apos;s certainly going to be worth sending a couple of big brands .
who knows , maybe for the moment the movie comes out , let &apos;s see us as a whole bunch of prescription idiots .
what do you think is going to be the answer ?
most of the answers will be &quot; no . &quot;
but will it be hard to sell , by the film or for me ?
jk : both things .
it means you &apos;re not very optimistic .
so , do you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
all right .
impressive .
we have to think about what brands .
yes .
when you look at the people you have to treat .
we have some places to go .
turn the camera off .
i thought , &quot; <unk> the camera , &quot; meant we have a conversation outside our mic .
the camera says , &quot; we don &apos;t want to know anything about your movie . &quot;
and so it was , one by one , all these companies suddenly disappeared .
none of them wanted to have anything to do with this movie .
i was shocked .
they didn &apos;t want to know anything about this .
and i was very struck by it ; i thought the concept of advertising , was given the product to as many people as possible , asking that so many people would see it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this intersection of new media and old media and the media setting , right , is it not the idea to have that new vehicle worthy of attention that &apos;s going to lead the message to the masses ?
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had a <unk> error , and that error was this .
actually , no , no such mistake .
there was no mistake at all .
this would have been fine .
but the problem was what this image represents .
see , when you &apos;re looking for transparency images in google , this is one of the first images that comes up .
i like your way to roll , sergey brin . no .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or seen , easily understandable -- that &apos;s characterized by visibility or <unk> of information , especially in business practices -- being the last line maybe the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency in these days .
our politicians name it , the ceo , <unk> , even the ceos name it .
but all of a sudden when it comes to it , something really changes .
but why ? well , transparency is afraid -- like that weird bear that &apos;s still <unk> .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this weird road .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what &apos;s another thing that &apos;s risky ?
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s very risky .
when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to teach it . &quot;
we want them to be a story , but we want them to read our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father would lie to me on a lie -- and there he is staring at me like he used to say , &quot; son , there are three sides in every story .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , and there &apos;s real history . &quot;
as you see , in this film , we wanted to tell the actual story .
but with just one company , an agency wants to help me -- and that only because i knew john bond and richard <unk> -- i realized i would have to go on my own , i would have to get out of the middle @-@ class and go to the companies myself with my whole team .
so what i started to realize all of a sudden -- and i started giving myself a sense of -- is that when you start talking to corporations , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends who make large films , huge , giant films and other people who make small films , independent films like mine .
and my friends who make great hollywood movies , giant , say the reason their movies are so successful is because of the associated brands that they have .
and then my friends who do independent movies say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
how are we going to see specifically to ban it in the movie ?
every time i &apos;m about to go out , every time i open my <unk> , you &apos;ll see the ban .
at any time during an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you cool for this interview ?
are you ready ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you out .
maybe you should get a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
and there he was one of these fabulous <unk> .
so much &quot; floral fusion &quot; as &quot; <unk> of paradise &quot; is going to have its opportunity .
we &apos;re going to have as much for a man as a woman , solid , to <unk> , onstage , whatever .
that &apos;s the general look .
now i can answer your questions and give you a glimpse .
we &apos;re a small brand .
similar to the kind of smaller movies that we dream about ; we &apos;re much rather a competing brand .
so we don &apos;t have the budget that has other brands .
so , doing things like that , you know , digging out people is the reason we &apos;re interested in this .
what words would they use to describe to ban ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a big question .
high tech .
technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put into the <unk> .
we talk about something bold , fresh .
i think &quot; cool &quot; is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus &quot; fighting the smell and sweat . &quot;
it keeps you cool .
how do we keep you getting cool ? with better , more freshness , three times cooler .
things like those that <unk> the benefits .
and that &apos;s a <unk> enterprise .
what about me ? what about a common type ?
i need to talk to the man on the street , to the people like me , to the common <unk> .
they have to talk to me about my brand .
how do you define your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like good clothes .
woman : she reaches &apos; 80s , &apos; <unk> &apos; unless she &apos;s <unk> .
okay , so what &apos;s the <unk> brand ?
something unique .
i guess the kind of gender , the style i have would be like a dark glamour .
i like dark colors , lots of gray and things like that .
i usually wear <unk> like sunglasses , or i like crystals and similar .
if dan was a brand , he could be a classic <unk> , mercedes benz .
the brand i am , i would call it casual flight .
woman # 2 : in a part of a hippie , in part of &apos; girl brooklyn , i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the type of pets .
i sell pet toys in the country and in the world .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my little sector , that &apos;s my brand .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because he <unk> the <unk> .
man 5 : <unk> @-@ <unk> .
is that something ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be tom , but i often get into the intersection of dark glamour and a casual flight .
i realized i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could get into my head , someone who could help me understand what they call the &quot; brand personality . &quot;
and i found a company called pittsburgh <unk> .
they helped him companies like <unk> , <unk> , help him discover that personality .
if they could do it for them , they could surely do it for me .
just shoot the photos , right ?
yes . the first photo is a family photo .
tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to being .
these guys shape my way of looking at the world .
tell me about that world .
that world ? i think your world is the world you live in -- like the people around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the work you do .
all of these things come from and they start in a place , and in my case , they come in and they start in my family , in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next is &quot; this is the best day of my life . &quot;
how does this relate to your thoughts , feelings and your way to be ?
it &apos;s like who wants to be me .
i like different things .
i like weird stuff . i like weird stuff .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; -- what &apos;s good for us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what &apos;s the <unk> stage do you find now ?
why is it important to <unk> ? what &apos;s red ?
tell me a little bit about that .
a little more of you , which is not who you are .
what other speakers have ?
it doesn &apos;t have to fear . what kind of rollercoaster you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yes . all right .
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of this .
there was a lot of madness .
the first thing i saw was this idea that there are two different sides , but margins , in your brand personality , morgan <unk> , is a self @-@ conscious brand .
they were getting really good together .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox in them .
and i think some corporations will only focus on one of their strong points or another rather than focusing on both .
many companies tend to -- and it &apos;s nature -- to avoid the things that are not safe ; it prevents fear , those elements , and you actually give them to sink and make them become positive for you , and it &apos;s nice to see that .
what other brands are like this ?
the first one here is the classic , apple .
and you can also see here at <unk> , wii , mini , which is <unk> and <unk> .
now , there are <unk> brands and conscious brands , those things that have come and come , but a playful self @-@ conscious brand is quite powerful .
a playful conscious brand . what is your brand ?
if someone asks you to understand your brand identity , your brand personality , what would it be ?
are you a ascending asset ? are you somebody who makes blood flow ?
or are you a lower asset ?
a little bit cooler , reserved , conservative ?
the further attributes are like being playful , like the prince , contemporary , <unk> , fearless , fearless or bold as <unk> , rapid , or <unk> , dominant , magic or mystic as <unk> .
or are you better off @-@ the @-@ down ?
are you mindful , sophisticated ?
are you set up , traditional provider , protector ? you &apos;re all distracted by oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , familiar , trustworthy , confident , holy or wise , like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of this movie , we had over 500 companies , climbing and <unk> , saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want to be part of this project .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film , mainly because they wouldn &apos;t have control , they wouldn &apos;t have control over the end product .
but we got 17 marketing partners who were willing to give up that control that they wanted to be in the business with someone who was aware of and playful like me , and ultimately , they gave us power to tell stories that we would usually not have been able to tell stories after a <unk> would usually go .
we were allowed to tell the story of <unk> , and we were able to tell the story in this movie of how they now use mri to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing like film .
we went to san paulo where advertising has been banned from open air .
throughout the city for the last five years , there &apos;s no fences , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and we went to school districts where businesses are on their way into schools with the liquidity problems .
the amazing thing for me is that the projects that i &apos;ve had the biggest answer , or where i &apos;ve been most successful are the ones that i &apos;ve been focused on .
and that &apos;s what these marks did .
they took the <unk> , they took their agencies , and they said maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to try directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to make people think , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world .
and how has it gone ? is it successful ?
well , ever since the movie was released in the <unk> festival , let &apos;s take a look .
as the movie came out in january , and since then -- and this is not <unk> , we &apos;ve had 900 million impressions in the media for this film .
this just takes a two @-@ week period .
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no tv .
the movie is still not <unk> .
it &apos;s still not online . it &apos;s not <unk> .
it hasn &apos;t even presented in other countries yet .
ultimately , this film has begun to gain momentum .
and it &apos;s not bad because almost all the agencies that we talk to her clients will not be part .
i &apos;ve always believed that if you risk them , if you take risks , that in those risks there are opportunities .
i think when you get people out of that , you &apos;re pushing them into failure .
i think when you train your employees at risk aversion , you &apos;re preparing your whole company to reward them for rewards .
i feel that what &apos;s happening to move forward is that we have to encourage people to risk .
we have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford .
ultimately , let &apos;s move forward , i think we have to bring fear back .
we have to put that bear in a cage .
it <unk> fear . it <unk> risk .
from a <unk> at a time , we have to embrace risk .
and ultimately , we have to go for transparency .
more than just a little bit of honesty , it &apos;s going to go a long way .
and by saying this , with honesty and transparency , all my talk , &quot; <unk> the <unk> , &quot; has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for dollars had the rights of the name on ebay .
it turns big data into big opportunities for companies around the world .
<unk> presents &quot; <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
thank you very much people .
so , morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened with those dollars growing ?
it &apos;s a fantastic question .
in my pocket , i have a check to be asked by the ted matrix , which is the international foundation , which is a check for dollars to be applied to my assistance for ted next year .
my name is <unk> .
and he was 18 months ago doing another job on google , until i launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss , who &apos;s here and let me do it .
it took me 18 and a half months .
many negotiations and stories , i assure you , 17 very interesting museums in nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did it .
i think my own story just explains this slide , and this is access .
i grew up in india .
joy of great education -- i didn &apos;t get educated , but i didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and artwork .
so , when i started traveling and going to museums , i started learning a lot .
and working on google , i &apos;m trying to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing so .
better than the demo i &apos;m going to show you a couple of interesting things that we &apos;ve done since the launch .
so , just simply : we &apos;re going to <unk> it .
look around all the museums there .
there &apos;s the <unk> gallery , moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i &apos;m actually going to go into one of my favorites , the <unk> , the new york art museum .
there are two ways of doing that -- very simple .
we click , we click , we click .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are , bombay <unk> , that doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around and you have fun .
do you want to browse to the museum ?
we cut the upper plane , and with one click , we jump inside .
they &apos;re inside , they want to go to the end of the hall .
keep on going . <unk> !
exploring .
thank you , but i haven &apos;t reached the best .
now , i &apos;m standing in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the <unk> &quot; by pieter <unk> .
i see the + sign .
if the museum shows us the picture , we click there .
look , this is one of the images .
here &apos;s all the metadata data .
for those of you who are really interested in art , you can click there , but i &apos;m going to click right now .
and this is one of the images we &apos;ve captured in what we call <unk> technology .
so this picture , for example , contains , i think , 10,000 million hits .
and there are a lot of people who ask me , &quot; what do you get with 10,000 million hits ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk> .
it can zoom in around in a very simple way .
you see fun things happening .
i love this guy , his expression has no price .
but if you really wanted to go into it .
so , i started playing , and i found something that was going on there .
and i said , &quot; wait a minute , this looks interesting . &quot;
i went in and discovered that kids were actually playing something .
i did a little research , i talked to some people from the <unk> , and i actually discovered that this is a game called &#91; unclear &#93; , which is to hit a stick with a stick on the front tuesday .
and it seems very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they were doing it , but i &apos;ve learned something about it .
and now we &apos;re going to get even further down , and you &apos;ll see that you can actually even get to the cracks .
now just to give you a little bit of perspective , i &apos;m going to take the picture away , so you &apos;ll really see what &apos;s there .
this is where we were , and this is painting .
the best thing is coming , second .
so now we &apos;re going to fast jump again to moma in new york .
here &apos;s another one of my favorites , &quot; the night <unk> . &quot;
the example i showed was to find some details .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
it increases , and it really does .
i go to one of my favorite parts in this picture , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
this is &quot; <unk> night , &quot; i think i &apos;ve never seen it before .
i &apos;m going to show you another one of my favorite features .
there are a lot more things here , but i don &apos;t have time to go .
this is the really cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
all of you , absolutely everyone , doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich or poor , or if you have a mansion , that just doesn &apos;t matter .
you can online create your own museum , create your own collection from all these pictures .
it &apos;s very simple ; we come in -- i &apos;ve created this kind of function that i call &quot; the power of zooming , &quot; -- we just kind of zoom in .
this is &quot; the ambassadors &quot; in the national gallery in london .
you can write things down , send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you contemplate these masterpieces .
so , in conclusion , i think for me , the main thing is that all incredible things really don &apos;t come from google .
no , in my opinion , they don &apos;t even come from museums .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say that .
actually , they come from those artists .
and that &apos;s been my humble experience with this .
i mean , i hope that in this digital medium does justice to its artwork and to be properly represented .
and the big question i &apos;m asked today is , &quot; are you doing this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s for supplement the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts .
the left side , which is the logical part , and the right side , which is the intuitive part .
so , if you look at a scale to measure the fitness of every hemisphere , you could design a plan of our brain .
for example , this would be someone who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s totally intuitive .
so , where do you measure your brain on this scale ?
some people spit through one of these extreme ends , but i think for most of the members of this audience , his brain is something like this -- with a great fitness in both of them <unk> .
it &apos;s not that they are mutually exclusive .
you can be intuitive , intuitive .
i consider myself one of those people , which is just the same as most of the other quantum physicists , we need quite a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas .
but at the same time , we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we like to play with things .
we start to play with them , and then we see them react , and then we develop our intuition from that point .
and actually , you do the same thing .
some intuition that you might have developed over the years is that one thing that says that one thing can only be in a place at a time .
i mean , it may sound odd to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , they developed it .
i remember looking at a kid playing in a parking lot .
he was a little kid , and he didn &apos;t do it very well , he always fell .
but i bet the game with that parking bar taught him a worthy lesson , and that is that big stuff doesn &apos;t allow the <unk> to stay in a place .
this is a big conceptual model that you can have from the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with parking bars , they play with these strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , they discover that they do all sorts of really strange things -- like they can walk across walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called it quantum mechanics theory .
at that point , physics was found a few years ago ; you had the quantum mechanics to describe these little particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the big objects around us every day .
that &apos;s not really good for my intuition , and maybe that &apos;s because i don &apos;t play very often with particles .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not so much .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody saw a particle .
but it also wouldn &apos;t get me started to my logical side .
because if it &apos;s all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t find the reason it shouldn &apos;t .
and so i would feel much better if i could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics .
that &apos;s why a few years ago , i set out to do exactly that .
and i did .
this is the first object you can see that it &apos;s been in a kind of quantum mechanics .
what we see here is a little computer chip .
and you can try to see the green dot right in the middle .
that &apos;s the little bit of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
this is a picture of the object .
and here i &apos;m going to expand a little bit . it &apos;s right in the middle .
and then here we do a big approach to the little metal <unk> .
what we see is a little bit of metal , a trampoline way , and it comes together on a platform .
and so i did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with a silicon chip , and i started running all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last material , i had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the form of the swimming underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap , but it needs some help .
let me make an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people .
i mean , when i &apos;m on a elevator only , i do all sorts of weird things , but then when other people come up , i stop doing those things , because i don &apos;t want to bother you , or , actually , frightening .
quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way .
so , the travel mates of inanimate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes up and the heat of the room .
so we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics , we would have to <unk> all the other passengers .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we <unk> the lights , then we introduced a vacuum , and we pulled all the air out , and then we cool it down to a lower temperature of a degree above zero .
now , being only on the elevator , the little bit of metal is free to act as you want .
so we measured their movements .
we found it moving into very strange forms .
instead of just staying still , i was vibrating , and the way i wrote it was kind of like a breath like this -- like a <unk> that expands and contracts .
and by giving it a nice push , we were able to make it float , and that doesn &apos;t hurt at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is really fantastic .
what does it mean that something <unk> and doesn &apos;t hurt at the same time ?
think about atoms .
in one case : all the billions of atoms that make up that little bit of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
it &apos;s just in certain directions when those are dancing .
in the rest of the time , they &apos;re <unk> .
it means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
i think this is great .
really .
it was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years , because , look at this , the difference on scale between one atom and that little metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , and that piece of metal can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you also ?
i mean , it &apos;s my logical part that he talks .
so imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time , what would that be ?
how would you affect your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space ?
there &apos;s another part of the story .
and that &apos;s when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and we looked inside the box , and we saw that the metal was still in one piece .
and i could get to this new intuition , apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected .
well , that &apos;s not so true .
it &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we needed to rethink how we think about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to go to live and work , they have the possibility of choice between at least a handful of different cities which are competing to engage new residents .
well , right now , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have a single city willing to describe it .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth much more than their construction cost .
so we could easily <unk> the tens of thousands , perhaps hundreds of new cities .
well , this may sound crazy if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but it just <unk> through apartment buildings .
imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already own , and yet half of them were still waiting to do it .
you could try to increase the capacity by making all the buildings out there .
but you know that the problem that <unk> is that buildings and areas surrounding them have rules to avoid discomfort and development distraction .
so it would be really hard to do all those <unk> .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new apartment building , always and when the rules of that place would build the construction rather than putting it in .
so i proposed that governments will bring new areas of reform to hold cities and give them a name : cities under charter .
i later learned that more or less at the same time , <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of honduras reform .
they knew that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in honduras .
and at a time , <unk> said to <unk> , &quot; what would happen if we were to take <unk> land , and we just gave them a u.s. embassy a little bit , a little bit of the u.s. embassy , and then , if people want to go to work under the rules of canada or the united states , they can go to work in , and they can look for all these lives in the terrain , and they could do it , and do it , and they could do it , do it ,
in the summer of 2009 , he went through a constitutional crisis .
in the next regular election , synthetic genomics have been awarded to a platform on which we collect reforms and at the same time in reconciliation .
he asked <unk> to be his boss &apos; boss .
meanwhile , i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal .
through a process of <unk> , trial and error and a tremendous amount of testing with users , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their most essential ideas .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t go and bother all the day residents of apartments .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes so much of technologies as rules to make progress , and usually it &apos;s the rules that keep us going .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent a link to the tedtalk .
he showed it to <unk> .
they called me .
they said , &quot; we will respect this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so in december , we sat in miami , in a hotel conference room .
i tried to tell you this point about how valuable cities are , much more valuable than their monetary cost .
and i used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like new york , notice , land that , in some cases , is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , and at some point , when there was a pause , he said , &quot; paul , maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk . &quot;
and the talk described in very simple terms that a city under a charter is a place where it starts out with <unk> territory , a charter that specifies all the rules that are <unk> there and a choice so that people can choose whether they want to go and not live under those rules .
so , the president of calcutta called me , and he told me that we had to do this project , this is important , this could be the way for our country to advance .
he asked me to go outside and talk again about the four and five of january .
so i presented another talk full of data , which included an image like this , which was trying to explain that in order to make a lot of value to a city , this has to be very big .
this is a photo from denver , and the white line is the new airport that was built in denver .
this airport alone covers over 100 square kilometers .
so , i was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city , you have to start with a site that was at least a thousand square kilometers .
that &apos;s over 100,000 acres .
everyone <unk> writes a lot .
the faces of the public were very serious and open .
the leader of congress approached the platform and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you so much for his talk , but maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk .
i have it here on my computer . &quot;
so i sat down and they showed the tedtalk .
and this explained the essentials that a new city can offer new choices for people .
there would be a option in a city where you could go that could be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away to the north .
and it also <unk> new choices for leaders .
because the leaders of the honduras government would need help from partners , could benefit from the countries that were associated with them and fulfill the rules of the charter , so that everyone could actually trust the charter .
and what the nih thought about was that there was this promise of performance that i was considering as a way of engaging the foreign investors in order to make sure that the city could be equal to all the parties in honduras for so many years for fear and mistrust .
we went and saw a website .
this photo is over there .
it could easily be about a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly afterwards , on the 19th of january , they voted in congress to <unk> their constitution , and add a constitutional that allowed us to create these special development regions .
in a country that had just passed through this painful crisis , the vote in congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was one .
all parties , all the factions in society , the <unk> .
to put it in the constitution , you have to pass twice in congress .
february 17 was approved again in another voting , from <unk> to one another .
immediately after the vote , of the 21st to the 24 of february , a 30 @-@ degree shifting delegation was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities .
one of them is south korea .
this is a picture of a new city center that &apos;s being built in south korea ; it &apos;s bigger than the center of boston .
everything that you see there was being built in four years , after four years passed away .
the other significant country in city building is singapore .
in fact , they &apos;ve already built two cities in china and are preparing for a third .
and if you think about this in a practical way , this is the point where we are .
they have a website , and they &apos;re already thinking about a website for the second city .
they &apos;re making a legal system that would allow the administrators to come , and at the same time it would allow them to operate under an external legal system .
a country has already committed to allowing its supreme court to be the ultimate court for this new criminal system .
there are <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project .
they can even get some funding .
but the only thing we know that they &apos;ve already solved is they have a good number of inhabitants .
there are a lot of companies that would like to lie in the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to go there .
there are 700 million people in the world who say they would like to be changed immediately to another .
there &apos;s a million a year that comes out of latin america to go to the united states .
many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go get a job ; sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make the money to just eat or buy clothes .
sadly , sometimes there are even kids trying to meet their parents who haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , in a decade .
so , what do you think about building a new city in honduras ?
or build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these all over the world ?
what does it seem to you to think about trying to make families choice between cities that are competing to engage new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friend <unk> asked me to say , &quot; thank you ted . &quot;
guess how many decisions we make one day ?
do you know how much we choose in a week ?
recently , i did a survey of over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says pick an average american , are about 70 a day .
not so long ago , in research , they continued for a week to a group of game presidents .
researchers registered the different kinds of tasks by these ceos and the time they were working with these tasks .
they found that , on average , they found <unk> jobs a week .
naturally , every single work included a lot of <unk> .
half those decisions took nine minutes or so .
only 12 percent it takes an hour or more of its time .
now think of your choices .
do you know how many people belong to the age of nine minutes , and how many of an hour ?
how do you deal with the way those decisions drive ?
i want to talk today about one of the major problems of today : choice of choice .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
while i &apos;m talking about this , i &apos;m going to ask you a few questions , and i need to know their answers .
when i ask a question , as i &apos;m blind , raise your hand only if you want to burn calories .
otherwise , when you ask a question , if your answer is positive , please have a <unk> .
and now my first question of the day : are you ready to hear about the problem of choice ?
thank you .
being a graduate student at stanford university , <unk> this very , very high @-@ level grocery store , at least at that time , was very sophisticated .
it was called <unk> .
it was almost like going to an amusement park .
there were about 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar , over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of bottled water . and this was when we were shooting water .
i loved going to that store , but one time i asked myself , why didn &apos;t i buy anything ?
this is the olive oil shelf .
they had over 75 different classes , including the ones that were in a sealed box that came out of <unk> trees .
i once decided to visit the manager , and i said , &quot; well , do you have this strategy to offer all these choices ? &quot;
he pointed to me the buses full of tourists every day , usually with his cameras .
we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> . this is the <unk> .
they had different classes .
we set up a seat for <unk> , right at the entrance to the store .
we put there six tastes there , or 24 different flavors , and we looked at two things : first , what if people were willing to stop at <unk> ?
more people stopped when there was 24 -- 60 percent , than when there were only six , 40 percent .
we also looked at what case they were most likely to purchase a <unk> .
here we find the opposite effect .
of those who stopped when he was 24 , only 3 percent came to buy <unk> .
the ones who stopped when there were six , we saw that 30 percent bought <unk> .
if we do the calculations , people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found 24 .
well , to decide that we don &apos;t buy <unk> , we probably want to have a good job , to save the <unk> , but it turns out that the problem of choice overload is affecting us in a profound way .
we decided not to decide , even when this doesn &apos;t hurt us .
now the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , where we look at the decisions about savings in terms of a million americans , out of some 650 plans in this country .
we were interested in seeing if the number of funds available for retirement savings plans , <unk> program , helping people save for the future .
and we found that there really was a correlation .
we had <unk> plans that went from two to 59 different options .
we found that the bigger the number of biomedical funds , there were less participation .
so , if you look at the edge , you see that in the plans that offer two funds , the participation rate was 70 or more , not as high as you would like .
and in the plans that a few 60 funds , the rate of participation brought down to the 60 .
it turns out even if you decide to engage , when there &apos;s more options , even in that case , there &apos;s negative consequences .
so , for those of you who decided to participate , the larger the number of choices , the more people would be empowered to avoid the actions or the investment funds .
as soon as there were more options , they were more willing to invest in financial accounts .
but none of these extreme decisions are the ones to optimize future wealth .
in the last decade we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities .
the most likely thing is that it <unk> the decision , that it <unk> even when this goes into self @-@ interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make the worst decisions ; in finance and health .
they &apos;re more likely to pick things less satisfying , even though they &apos;re buried better .
the main reason is that we &apos;re going to start looking at this huge array of <unk> , vinegar , and vinegar , but we &apos;re not able to do the calculations to compare , contrast and choose from that amazing exhibition .
today i want to use four simple techniques that we have tried , in one way or another , in different research , so you can actually test them in your business .
the first is cut , cut .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , which is less .
people always get upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they care about losing space in <unk> .
but actually , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut off , get rid of odd options , there will be a spike in sales , there will be a better experience in choice .
when <unk> &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; t @-@ &amp; amp ; <unk> , they saw a 10 percent increase in sales .
when the <unk> corporation removed the products for <unk> of cats who were less selling them , they grew up at 87 percent , for two causes : higher sales and lower costs .
you know , supermarkets today , on average , we have 14,000 products .
in a walmart store , you have 100,000 products .
but the nine biggest store in the world today is <unk> , and it offers only <unk> products ; it &apos;s a kind of tomato sauce .
in the world of financial savings , i think one of the best examples that has emerged on how to handle better choices is david <unk> &apos;s question , the harvard program .
all the harvard employees are automatically embedded in a safe living fund .
those who really want to pick , give them 20 funds , not 300 or more .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
they &apos;re all important options . &quot;
the first thing i do is i ask employees , &quot; <unk> the differences between those choices .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell the difference , they can &apos;t make your customers . &quot;
this afternoon , before i started this session , i was talking to gary .
he told me that he would be willing to offer the people of this audience a few holidays with all the most beautiful highway in the world .
here , a description .
i want you to read it .
i &apos;m going to leave a few seconds to read it , and then i want you to give it a hand if you &apos;re ready to take the deal of gary .
ok . anyone who &apos;s ready to accept supply .
aren &apos;t they more ?
well , i &apos;m going to show you something else .
you knew there was a trick .
who &apos;s ready for that journey ?
i think i actually learned more by hearing .
all right .
actually , you have more information in the first round , than in the second round , but i can tell you that you thought the second time was more real .
because the images made it more real .
this leads me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem that &apos;s <unk> .
for people to understand the differences between choice , they have to understand the consequences of every choice , and that the consequences have to feel very deeply vivid , concrete .
why is it that people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use card or credit cards , which when they &apos;re using cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t look real money .
it turns out that making people look more real , it can be a very positive tool for people to understand more .
we did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , on staff of <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were attached to a holistic plan .
at that meeting , which was exactly what it used to be , we did an addition .
what we added was that we asked the staff to think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were more money .
with this <unk> , there was a spike in 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or whatever they wanted to put in their savings accounts , four percent .
the third technique is to classify .
we can handle more categories than options .
for example , this is a study we did in a magazine hall .
we saw that in the <unk> valley throughout the northeast corridor , the exhibition of magazines can hold on different kinds of <unk> .
but , you know ?
if i show you 600 magazines and i do it in 10 categories , and i compare it to 400 <unk> in 20 groups , you &apos;ll believe that i &apos;ve offered you more choices and a better choice experience if i offer those 400 , that if i put 600 .
because the classification indicates how to behave .
these are two pieces of jewelry .
one is called &quot; <unk> &quot; and the other , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the one on the left is <unk> , and the one on the right is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
well , there are some .
if you think the one on the left is <unk> , and the one on the right is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
well , something else .
turns out that &apos;s right .
the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> . but , you know what ?
this rating is absolutely useless .
the categories need to indicate something you choose , not what you call them .
you often see this problem with these huge fundraising lists .
supposedly , who are they informing ?
my fourth category : <unk> complexity .
it turns out we can handle a lot more information than we think , if we just manage it a little bit .
we have to increase complexity gradually .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s look at a complicated decision ; buy it from a car .
this is a german car manufacturer that allows you to fully train .
you &apos;ve got to make 60 decisions , so you put the car together .
and these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one .
color , outdoor color . i &apos;m 56 possibilities .
engine , change box , four choices .
what i &apos;m going to do is change the order in which the decisions come up .
so half the clients are going to go from lots of options , 56 colors , just a few , four boxes .
the other half of the clients are going to go from a few options , four boxes , 56 colors , lots of options .
and what am i going to look at ?
how much you are involved .
if the default button in every decision , this indicates they &apos;re overwhelmed , i mean , we &apos;re losing them .
we found that those who go from lots of choices to a few , press the default button over and over and over again .
we miss them .
if you go from a few choices to a lot , they continue there .
the same information , the same number of choices .
the only thing i did was , i <unk> the order where the information is presented .
if you start with the easy thing , you learn to pick .
even though the choice of change doesn &apos;t say anything about the preferences of interior decoration , in all ways makes us choice .
we &apos;re excited about a product that we &apos;re building , which is now more <unk> to the process .
to sum up .
i &apos;ve talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of choice : cutting , cutting , cutting out strange alternatives ; <unk> them ; we can make it real ; we can put more categories with less choices ; <unk> complexity .
all these techniques that i presented to you were designed to help drive the alternatives , or better , for you , to use them in your business , or for the people who serve .
i think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to the choice .
and the more careful we stay in our best choices we &apos;ll be able to practice choice art .
thank you very much .
hello . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , youtube trends , and i look at youtube videos in a professional way .
it &apos;s true .
so today we &apos;re going to see why video videos are made viral and how important that is .
we all want to be celebrity stars ; singers , comedians -- when i was younger , that seemed like something very , very difficult .
but today the web video makes any of us , or our actions , copper in a part of our global culture .
anyone can be famous on the internet in a <unk> .
over 48 hours to youtube for a minute .
and , of those , just a small percentage gets viral , they get lots of views and they win cultural <unk> .
how does that happen ?
three things : creators of trends , communities of participation and surprise .
well , let &apos;s start .
oh , my god , my god .
oh , my god !
wow .
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> published this video clip outside his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was seen 23 million times .
this graph shows the views at the popularity of the past summer .
<unk> don &apos;t join with a viral video .
i just wanted to share a double rainbow .
that &apos;s what you do if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain <unk> .
i had published many videos of nature .
this video had been published in january .
so , what happened here ?
it was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> published this <unk> that <unk> video to popularity .
makers of trends like jimmy <unk> present new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience .
it &apos;s friday . you have to start friday . everyone wants the weekend to come , last week . friday , starting friday . you don &apos;t think we could have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
&quot; friday , &quot; rebecca is one of the most popular videos in the year .
they saw it almost 200 million times this year .
this graph shows the frequency of use .
just like , &quot; rainbow two , &quot; this video seemed to have emerged out of nowhere .
so , what happened this day ?
well , it &apos;s friday , it &apos;s true .
and if you ask for those other peaks , they &apos;re also friday .
but what happened this day , this particular friday ?
well , he took a look at it and a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael moschen , of <unk> science theater , was one of the first people to make a joke on the video on twitter .
but what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of creators take a point of view and share it with a wider audience , accelerating the process .
so , this community of people who share this great inner joke then starts talking about it and doing things .
and now there are 10,000 <unk> of friday on youtube .
just in the first seven days , there was a parody for each of other day .
unlike 20th @-@ century entertainment , this communal engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with it .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation with a music made .
so , that &apos;s it .
this year they saw him 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s odd , you know , there &apos;s a three @-@ hour version that &apos;s been seen four million times .
even the cats saw this video .
and there are cats who saw other cats watching the video .
but what &apos;s important here is the creativity that sparked amongst the internet community .
there was <unk> .
somebody made an old version .
and then international became international .
suddenly , there was a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be part of .
because today we don &apos;t just enjoy , we get involved .
who could have predicted something like that ?
who could have predicted &quot; was double @-@ rainbow , &quot; or rebecca <unk> ? &quot;
what a script could have written this situation ?
in a world where two days of video are uploaded to a minute , only that single , unexpected thing can be summed up in the way that these things have done .
when a friend told me that i had to see this great video of a guy who runs against the <unk> of bikers in new york , that i wasn &apos;t really interested .
i &apos;m criticized for <unk> , but there are often obstacles that keep you from running properly for <unk> .
thanks to the surprise effect and his humor , casey <unk> managed to get five million people to see and understand their idea .
so this approach is worth all the new things that we do in a creative way .
and all this leads to a big question .
what does this mean ?
<unk> .
what does this mean ?
the creators of the tendency , the creative communities of participation , the whole unexpected , are features of a new kind of media , of a new culture , which we all have access to , and is the audience that defines popularity .
as i said before , one of the current celebrities of the world , justin , started on youtube .
don &apos;t ask permission to express your ideas .
now we &apos;re all a little owners of our pop culture .
these are not the characteristics of the old media , they &apos;re just the ones of today &apos;s media , but they &apos;re the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how i can rotate it in 10 minutes about the links between women for over three generations , how the incredible force of those ties is scattered into the life of a four @-@ year @-@ old girl , <unk> alongside her sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights on a small boat in the sea of china , over 30 years ago , that girl never lives .
this is not a finished story .
it &apos;s a puzzle which is still <unk> .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man is burning the work of a whole life .
he &apos;s a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been supported by the single hope of unity and freedom of his country .
<unk> while the communist comes in <unk> , <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain .
words , so long as a friend of mine , now we will .
he was silent .
he died through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never allowed me to forget her story .
my job was not to let that have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that history tried to hate it , but i <unk> it .
the next part of the puzzle is about a boat as quietly dawn on the sea .
my mother , <unk> , was only 18 years old when her father died , and a marriage and two little girls .
for her , life had gone to one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was inconceivable for her that she could not do it .
and then , after a four @-@ year @-@ old <unk> who defies fiction , a boat <unk> into the sea of <unk> ship .
all the adults knew the risks .
the biggest fear was pirates , rape and death .
like most adults , my mother was wearing a poison <unk> .
if i could catch you , we would first take my sister and i would , and then she and my grandmother .
my first memories are from that boat , the constant pace of the engine , <unk> it into every wave , and the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came several times , but they were fooled by the <unk> of men on our boat , or the engine dying , and not being able to break for six hours .
but i do remember the lights on the oil shelf front coast of malaysia , and the young man who collapsed and died , finishing on the journey was too much for him , and the first apple i tried , given by the men on the platform .
no apple then had the same taste .
after three months in a refugee camp , <unk> in melbourne .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women across three generations leading a new life together .
we set up in <unk> , a working @-@ class <unk> , whose population is made up of immigrants .
in contrast to the middle @-@ class suburbs , whose existence i practiced , in <unk> , there was no sense of the right .
the smells that came from the shops were from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> english fragments was <unk> between the people who had one thing in common : they were starting again .
my mother worked in farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , twice .
yet , he found time to study english and get a title in it .
we were poor .
all the dollars were pouring in , and the extra <unk> get involved in english and math , they didn &apos;t care what was supposed to take off , which was usually new clothes ; it was always <unk> .
two middle pairs for school , one to hide holes in the other .
a school uniform up to the ankles , because it had to last six years .
and there were weird , little <unk> about the <unk> eyes and some graffiti : &quot; <unk> , come home . &quot;
where ?
something in me is being distracted .
i was accumulating determination and a voice saying , &quot; i &apos;m going to pray . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i <unk> in the same bed .
my mother was devastated every night , but we had a conversation about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home .
my mother ached , all the ship .
and my task was to be awake until its nightmares began in order to be able to get them wrong .
she opened up a computer shop , then studied to be a <unk> and opened another business .
and the women were coming up with their stories about men who couldn &apos;t make the transition , angry and <unk> , and kids were caught in between two worlds .
they were looking for subsidies and sponsors .
and they created centers .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , it was the classic asian student , <unk> what i <unk> with .
on the other hand , i was <unk> in <unk> lives , tragically <unk> by violence , abuse of drugs and isolation .
but a lot of help from the years .
and for that job , when i was learning my last year of <unk> , i was elected the united states of the year .
and i was <unk> from a piece of puzzle to the other , but its edges didn &apos;t match .
so inviting me , the anonymous <unk> resident , was now le <unk> and social activist , invited to speak at sites that i never heard before , and homes whose existence she would never have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
i didn &apos;t know how to use <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to retreat into life @-@ stay dinners and into a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for nearly 20 years , <unk> on the day of every single one and a <unk> , the three still in bed .
and i told my mom i couldn &apos;t do it .
it reminded me that i was right now the same age that she had when we got on the boat .
the &quot; had never been a choice .
&quot; do it , &quot; he said , &quot; and not be what you &apos;re not going to do . &quot;
so i talked about juvenile <unk> and education and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> .
and the more frankly i was talking about , the more i was glad to speak .
i met people from all walks of life , a lot of them doing what they loved , living on the border of the possible .
and although i finished my undergraduate degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t stay in a career of <unk> .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a stranger , a very recently arrived , on the scene -- and not only that it &apos;s okay , but it &apos;s something to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
because being inside can easily mean <unk> the horizons , it can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your province .
i gave the enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that , yes , the world will melt down , but not the way we fear .
possibilities that hadn &apos;t been <unk> were tremendously <unk> .
there was an energy there , a <unk> optimism , a rare mix of humility and courage .
so i follow my intuition .
i joined a small group of people who the slogan &quot; cannot be done &quot; was a compelling challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
at the end of every day , i did a giant soup pot that we all shared .
we worked up to the entrance to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but some brilliant , and we just turned around .
i made the decision to get it to the u.s.
after a single trip .
my hunch again .
three months later , i had moved , and the adventure continued .
before i finish , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when <unk> was social norm and local mandarin was the person who cared .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after she was born .
the mother grew up alone .
when i was 17 , he became a mandarin <unk> whose mother beat her up .
without support of her husband , he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to get the cause himself , and much more <unk> caused when he won .
the &quot; can &apos;t be done . &quot;
i was in the shower in a hotel room in sydney when she died , a mile away in melbourne .
i looked through the shower guy , and i watched him stop the other side .
i knew i had come to <unk> .
my mother called for minutes later .
days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his coffin .
we tell stories and we make sure that we were still with it .
at night a monk came in and told us that he had to close his coffin .
my mother asked us to hold her hand .
he asked the monk : &quot; why is his hand hot , and the rest of the body so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve taken your hand since the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they haven &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a nerve in our family , it runs through women .
given those of us and how life formed us , we can now see that the men who would have reached our lives would have frustrated us .
the defeat would have easily <unk> .
now i want to have my own kids , and i wonder about the boat .
who could wish for that ?
however , i fear the privilege of the easy , the right .
can i give you a <unk> in your life , <unk> in every wave , the constant pace of the engine , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it up and see it safe , it would .
<unk> <unk> and also the <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph .
or is it <unk> ?
because , of course , they &apos;re photographs that they can &apos;t take with their cameras .
my interest in photography was introduced to my first digital camera to the age of 15 .
it was associated with my previous passion for the drawing , but it was a little bit different because using the camera , the process was in planning .
and when you take a picture of a camera , the process ends up when you click the <unk> .
for me , photography had more to do with being in the right place , at the right time .
it seemed that anyone could do it .
so i wanted to create a different thing , a process that started <unk> the <unk> .
photos like this : a very <unk> highway .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and , despite that , it holds a level of <unk> .
or pictures like these -- dark and colorful pictures at the same time , but with the common goal of keeping track level .
and when i say <unk> , i say <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that can happen , but i always want it to be captured in some way like photography .
photos that you have to think about for a moment to discover the trick .
it has more to do with capturing an idea than a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes them look real ?
are the details , or the colors ?
does light intervene ?
what does the illusion create ?
sometimes the illusion is perspective .
but ultimately , it &apos;s our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a two @-@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s actually not about whether it &apos;s realistic , it &apos;s about what we think it &apos;s realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality .
let me show you a simple example .
so here we have three objects which is something that we can all relate to the three @-@ dimensional world .
but they combined , in a way , they can create something that still looks three , as if it existed .
but at the same time , we know it doesn &apos;t exist .
so , <unk> the brain , because the brain doesn &apos;t really accept the fact that that doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process by combining pictures .
it really is about combining different realities .
and the things that make a realistic photo look like this , i think it &apos;s those that we don &apos;t even think of -- the things that surround us in our everyday life .
but when we combine pictures , it &apos;s very important to consider it , because otherwise something will look bad .
so i &apos;d like to say , there are three simple rules to go on and achieve realistic results .
as you can see , these images are not very special .
but combined , you can create something like this .
so the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective .
second , the pictures combined must have the same kind of light .
and these two pictures play with these requirements , they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light .
the third thing is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of all different images with a perfect union .
it has to be impossible to see where the image is going to be .
by measuring the color , the contrast and the <unk> on the edges , which are among the images , adding birth defects to depth of field , <unk> colors and noise , <unk> the boundaries between the various images and making it look a single , although a picture actually can have hundreds of layers .
this is another example .
you might think that &apos;s the picture of a landscape , and the bottom is manipulated .
but this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places .
personally , i think it &apos;s easier to create a place to find out because you don &apos;t have to put the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and as i thought about this idea in winter , i knew that i had several months to go in and find the different locations for the puzzle pieces .
for example , the fish was captured on a fishing journey .
the shores is a different location .
the <unk> part was captured in a stone pit .
and yes , i even did a red house on the top of the island so it sounds more swedish .
so to make a realistic result , i think it takes planning .
you always start with a sketch , an idea .
then you have to combine the different photographs .
and here , every piece is really neat .
if you do a good job by taking the photos , the result can be very beautiful and very crude .
all the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk about why a lot of health @-@ care projects fail .
and i think , really , the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at <unk> university was we <unk> a director of the listening .
and not in a very scientific way , she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients , family and they know , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
&quot; how can we help ? &quot;
and we tend to think , this is one of the big problems that everyone , or maybe not all , but most of the health and @-@ health projects fail , because we stop listening .
this is my logarithmic scale . this is a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a flip switch and off .
every morning i go up .
and yes , i have a challenge as you can see .
i put the challenge up to 95 kilograms .
but it &apos;s so simple , that every time i link to you , it sends my information to google health .
and my <unk> doctor has access to him too . so , he can see what my weight problem is , not at the same time when he needs <unk> assistance or some <unk> sense of that style , but to see it backwards .
but there &apos;s another thing .
as some of you know , i have over 4,000 followers on twitter .
so , every morning i link to you on a scale of wi @-@ fi , and before i get up to my car , people start telling me , &quot; <unk> , i think you need a light lunch today . &quot;
that &apos;s the best thing that can happen , because it &apos;s peer pressure to help patients , because it could be used for obesity , and also for patients to stop smoking .
on the other hand , he can rotate it to move people from his chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of his health .
from next week , it will be available .
this little <unk> attached to an iphone or another device .
and people will be able , from their houses , take their blood pressure , send it to their doctor , share it with others , for example , for 100 dollars .
this is the point where patients assume a position , they return to control and to be captains of their own boat , but it can also help us care about the challenges that we face , like the firing of costs of attention , the <unk> of demand and other issues .
making techniques that are simple to use and start with this to involve patients involved in the team .
and you can do it with techniques like this , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we did want to share with you with a video .
we all have car navigation controls .
maybe we even have them in our mobile phones .
we know perfectly where the atm machines are .
also , where are all the <unk> .
and of course , we can find fast food chains .
but where is the closest <unk> to help this patient ?
but we didn &apos;t know .
nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now .
so , what we did was , we <unk> the netherlands .
we created a website , and we asked the audience , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please tell us where , and when it &apos;s open , &quot; because it occasionally opens up in offices and others are closed .
and over 10,000 <unk> already were introduced in the netherlands .
the next step was to look for the application for that .
and we did an app for the ipad .
we created an app for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these <unk> .
and every time you &apos;re in the city of <unk> and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and the next few weeks you can use your mouse phone to find the nearest <unk> , which can save lives .
and from today , i would like to present this one , not just as <unk> <unk> , which is the name of the product , but also as <unk> .
and we <unk> them globally .
we &apos;re forcing all the colleagues in the world , in other universities , to help us find , to work and act as a hub for <unk> throughout the world .
every time you &apos;re on holiday and someone , it can be a relative or someone in front of you , you can find it .
i also would like to invite companies around the world that they could help us <unk> these .
they could be fedex or phone services , for example , to see whether the <unk> that &apos;s shown is still in place .
please drive into this and not only improve health , but take control of it .
thank you very much .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little company is looking at engaging the environment that &apos;s focused on ...
extended collaboration .
this is a little video of what we do .
mm : wait a minute .
you can take a little bit of a load .
we can -- we can continue -- we better leave the video on the side ...
no .
this is not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
oh , i &apos;m out of time ?
all right . thank you very much .
a couple of years ago , i set up an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work on an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to focus ; we need them to work on government .
the initiative was called america code , and it would be like a <unk> for <unk> .
we select a few members every year and we put them to work with the municipalities .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them to the wild city world .
they made big apps ; they worked with the employees <unk> .
his homework is about showing the possibilities of technology today .
meet al .
it &apos;s a boston poster .
here it appears as if i &apos;m looking for a quote , but what it really looks for is someone who has been <unk> by the snow , because he knows it &apos;s not very good at putting fires when it &apos;s covered by a foot of snow .
how did it get to ask help in this particular way ?
last year in boston , we had a team of members of code for america .
they were there in february , and at that time , they were last year .
they realized that the city never wiped out these <unk> .
but one of the members called erik <unk> @-@ <unk> noticed something else : that citizens were dealing with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them .
so he did as any good programmer , he developed an app .
it &apos;s a nice application in which you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you hold <unk> when you win .
when you do , you put a name on it , in this case you put al .
if you don &apos;t , someone can get you .
so , it has a playful component .
it &apos;s a modest application .
maybe it &apos;s the youngest of the 21 applications that are going on last year .
but it does something that no other technology in government does .
and it spreads viral .
a responsible driver of <unk> &apos;s city when he saw this application , he realized he could use it , not for snow , but for the citizens to <unk> the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these tar sands work , but people steal batteries .
so he asks the citizens to control them .
and then seattle decided to use it to get the citizens to prescribe the <unk> .
and chicago just came out there to get people to clear sidewalks when they were clear .
so , now we know nine cities that we could use it .
and this has spread out <unk> , organically .
if you know a little bit about government technology , you &apos;ll know this doesn &apos;t happen normally .
the software acquisition usually takes a couple of years .
last year in boston , we had a team working on a project that took three and a half months .
it was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children .
then we were told that , in fact , for the normal channels , it would have taken at least two and a half million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
now , there &apos;s a project in the california <unk> that &apos;s up until now two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so , an app that shows up in a couple of days , and spreads in viral form is a kind of warning to the institution of government .
it suggests the best way to work , not as in private enterprises , as many people think it should be .
neither as a technological company , but rather as the internet itself .
i mean , no constraints , open and <unk> .
and that &apos;s important .
but the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way of addressing this government question that has the new generation -- not as a problem of an institution -- but as a collective action problem .
and that &apos;s very good because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
and there &apos;s a very large community of people who are building the tools to build them together effectively .
and it &apos;s not just america &apos;s code , but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to civic apps every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up with government .
they feel great frustration to that , but they don &apos;t complain , they fix it .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost sight .
and that is , if we stop the feelings about politics , row in the front lines and all those other things that put us crazy , the government is essentially , in the words of tim o <unk> : &quot; what we do together because we cannot . &quot;
now , a lot of people have cleaned up the government .
if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask you to celebrate it , because things are changing .
politics does not change ; government does .
and because the government ultimately generates of us -- remember that from &quot; we , the people &quot; ? the way we think about it will affect the way we make change .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started with this .
and as a lot of people thought that the government was about choice people to make charges .
well , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that government is , above all , <unk> .
this is the telephone service and information center .
it &apos;s the place that manages phone calls if you mark <unk> in america .
if you ever have the opportunity to work in a city center like scott <unk> like part of this initiative -- in fact , everybody will find that people call the government with a very broad range of issues , even when it finds a <unk> in the house .
scott <unk> this call .
he entered &quot; <unk> &quot; at the official knowledge base .
he found nothing . he started with animal control .
and he finally said , &quot; hey , can you open the house doors , put quiet music and see if it &apos;s gone ? &quot;
and it worked . so , scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
boston has no call center .
it has an app , web and mobile , called <unk> .
don &apos;t give that application .
it was the work of very smart people at the office of new york <unk> .
one day , this really happened , came up with this request , &quot; <unk> in my garbage cube . i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s dead .
how do i make it go ? &quot;
<unk> &apos;s dynamic is different .
scott was talking in person .
freestyle itself is all public , so everyone can see this .
in this case , he saw a neighbor .
the next paper said , &quot; i approached the site , i found the garbage cube behind the house .
okay ? yes . yes .
i turned the cube around . i went home .
good evening , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the confluence of digital and physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government &apos;s income for distributed collaboration .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and here i don &apos;t necessarily mean the technological definition of platform .
i talk about a platform for people to come and help others .
so , a citizen helped another one , but here the government had a key role .
he connected the two people .
and it could be connected to government services to be necessary , but the neighbor is a better choice and cheaper than government services .
when a neighbor helps another , it <unk> communities .
if we call animal control , that costs a lot of money .
one important thing we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
a lot of people understand it , but think you &apos;re the input from the other .
our entry into the government system is voting .
how many times have you chosen a political leader , sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we expect the government to <unk> our values and challenge our needs , but then we don &apos;t see changes .
that &apos;s because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the surface four @-@ centimeter surface .
below that &apos;s what we call bureaucracy .
and we say that word with a lot of contempt .
but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps what that really belongs to us that we fund as something that operates against us , that other thing , and therefore we &apos;re losing power .
people think politics is sensual .
if we want this institution to work , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government work happens .
we have to collaborate with government machinery .
that makes <unk> motion .
have you seen them ?
it &apos;s a group of citizens concerned that they have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the <unk> of the financial reform project .
that &apos;s not political activism . that &apos;s bureaucratic activism .
and for those of us who are <unk> to government , it &apos;s time for us to ask what world we want to leave our children .
you have to see the huge challenges that they have to face .
do you really think we &apos;re going to get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of everyone ?
we cannot do it without government ; we need it to be more effective .
the good news is that with technology , it &apos;s possible to rethink the root function of government , so it can expand <unk> society .
there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and it knows it &apos;s not that hard to act <unk> , you just have to articulate the systems in the right way .
the average age of our members is 28 years old , so i , <unk> , i &apos;m a bigger generation than many of them .
this is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking the word and giving that almost by sitting .
they &apos;re not giving that battle that we all face about who &apos;s going to talk about ; everyone &apos;s going to talk .
they can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and do .
so when they face the government problem , they don &apos;t really care about making their voices heard .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they put hands on the work to program applications that make government work better .
and those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
it can be burning a fire hydrant , taking weeds , casting a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside .
of course , we were always able to have those <unk> and a lot of people do .
but these applications are like digital <unk> that we &apos;re not only consumers , we &apos;re not just consumers of government who pay taxes and we get services .
we &apos;re more than that : we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix the government until we don &apos;t <unk> the citizenship .
so i want to ask everybody here , when it comes to all the important things that we have to do together , all of us together , will we be a crowd of voices , or will we also be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
generally , i try to explain to people the wonderful thing that &apos;s going to be the new technologies that are emerging . you have to look backward to understand what &apos;s going on . here among friends , i want to tell you what i think about these big technological advances , so we can barely slow down .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a slide about technology , very boring .
please , if you can put it in ...
it &apos;s a diagram anyone i took out of a folder .
i &apos;m not so interested in showing you the details , but the general thing .
this is an analysis we were doing on the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that this , as many other people we tend to see , is sort of a straight line on a log scale .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in the yield scale .
talking about disruptive technology is something new .
here &apos;s a weird thing .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m going to talk about .
please turn on the lights .
it would take more intensity because it took over paper .
why would you change technological curves on <unk> ?
the answer is , if you were to draw on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , these are the years , or some unit of time , and this would be any measure of the technology that i would like to chart , the diagram would look ridiculous .
it would be something like this .
it doesn &apos;t say much .
but if you look at it , for example , some other technology , like transportation , on a hot spot , it would be really dumb , we would see a straight line .
but if something like this happens , you have a qualitative change .
if the technology of shipping is as fast as the microprocessors , last morning we could take a taxi and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
but it doesn &apos;t go through that pace .
there is no precedent in the history of technological development of <unk> that every few years advance the order of magnitude .
the question i want to make is -- we look at these exponential curves , we see that they don &apos;t go forever .
you can &apos;t hold this change as fast as it goes .
it will happen one of two things .
or you &apos;re going to turn it into a typical s @-@ like curve , until something else comes out , or maybe it will do something like that .
that &apos;s all that can happen .
i &apos;m optimistic , so i think maybe something will happen .
if we were , then we would be in the middle of a transition .
in this line , we &apos;re in a transition from what used to be the world , to a new way .
so what i &apos;m trying to ask , and i &apos;m saying , &quot; what is that new way around the world ? &quot;
where is the new state going ?
the transition seems very , very confused if we &apos;re embedded in it .
i remember as a child , the future was happening in 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
this is a conference where people talk about the future , and we see that the future is still 2000 .
that &apos;s all we see .
in other words , the future has <unk> , year after year , throughout my life .
but i think it &apos;s because we feel something &apos;s going on .
that &apos;s a transformation . we can feel it .
and we know it doesn &apos;t make any sense to think of 30 or 50 years , because it &apos;s all going to be so different to transport what we &apos;re doing today doesn &apos;t make any sense .
so i want to talk to you about how that might be , how could that transition be that we experience .
but to do that , i &apos;ll have to talk a little bit about things that don &apos;t have a lot to do with technology and computer technology .
because i think the only way to understand that is to take a distance and look at things over the long term .
the time scale i &apos;d like to do that is the time of life on earth .
i think this picture makes sense if we look at it every billion years .
so , we go back about 2.5 billion years when the earth was a big barren rock with a lot of chemicals <unk> around it .
if you look at the way those chemicals organized , you give us an idea of how things happened .
and i think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of rna . i &apos;m going to tell you a simple version of this , and that is , at the time , i had floating some oil <unk> with all sorts of chemicals inside .
some of these oil droplet covered a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside , so the blobs grew up .
and they started to divide .
in a sense , those were the most primitive cell forms -- those oil <unk> .
but those drops were not alive , in the current sense , because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals .
and every time it was added -- an unequal distribution of chemicals inside .
so every single <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the blobs which were somehow getting better than the time to incorporate the chemicals around , grew more chemical , grew more chemical and more chemical .
they were usually living longer ; they were more represented .
it was a form of life , chemistry , very simple chemistry , but things got interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction .
so , in a way that we don &apos;t really understand very well , they learned how to store information .
they learned to store information , which was the recipe for the cell , in a special chemical called dna .
in other words , <unk> in this evolution without any sense , a writing system that allowed them to record what was amazing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 million years .
our recipe , our genes , have exactly the same code , that same writing system .
in fact , every living thing is expressed exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
and one of the things i did just for fun -- we can now write things with this code .
here i have 100 <unk> of white dust that i try to hide people from airport security .
but it contains -- <unk> this code -- the code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and i wrote my personal data into this little piece of dna , and we gave it 10 to 22 times .
so if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card , i have a lot of everyone here , actually , for every single person in the world , and it &apos;s here .
if he was a <unk> , he would have put him in a virus and he would have spread him through the room .
what was the next step ?
writing dna was an interesting step .
this made these cells happy to be another billion years .
but then there was another big interesting step in which things got really different , and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know it , but bacteria can exchange dna .
so , for instance , it evolved antibiotic resistance .
some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little dna with other bacteria and now there &apos;s a lot of penicillin @-@ resistant because bacteria communicate .
this communication actually gave rise to communities that , in a way , were together in that , and there was a synergy .
so , <unk> or <unk> together , which is that if a community was very successful , all individuals in that community were increasingly <unk> by evolution .
and the tipping point happened when these communities came so close that , in fact , they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board into a string of dna .
the next interesting stage for life took another billion years .
and at that stage , we have <unk> communities , communities of many different kinds of cells working together as one organism alone .
in fact , we are a <unk> community .
we have lots of cells that don &apos;t act alone .
the skin cell doesn &apos;t work without the heart , or muscles , or brain .
so , these communities evolved and bred more interesting levels than cell phones , something we call an organism .
the next level happened within these communities .
these started <unk> information .
and building very special structures that they didn &apos;t do more than process information in community .
these are the neural structures .
neurons are the devices that process information that these mobile communities built .
in fact , they started <unk> inside the community being responsible structures to register , understanding and transmit information .
those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that moment as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism , and not the evolutionary period .
so , an organism could , for example , learn not to eat any fruit because he knew badly and got sick the last time he ate it .
that could happen during the life of an organism , because they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals who ate that fruit .
so the fact that the nervous system would build those structures of information that sped off the evolutionary process .
because evolution could now happen confined to an individual .
it could happen in time necessary to learn .
but then , of course , the individuals discovered the trick of the communication .
so , for example , the most refined version we know is human language .
if we think about it , it &apos;s an amazing invention .
i have a very complicated idea , a vague idea in my head .
i &apos;m here sitting emitting some <unk> and , hopefully , building a similar idea , vague and fuzzy , in his head that keeps some analogy to mine .
but we took something very complicated , we converted it into sound , in sound sequences , and we make something very complicated in another brain .
that now allows us to start running like an organism .
in fact , as humanity , we &apos;ve started doing <unk> .
now we go through similar periods to the multicellular organisms ; we <unk> our record methods , presentation and information processing .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
computer telephony , computer , video tape , cd @-@ rom , etc . , these are the specialized mechanisms that we &apos;re now building that information .
and that brings us into something much bigger , faster and able to evolve more than we would do before .
now evolution can happen at microseconds .
you saw the evolutionary <unk> in which there was some evolution with the <unk> program , in front of our eyes .
and now we &apos;ve accelerated the time again .
the first phase of the story i told you were a billion years each .
the next stage , the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
the next , the language . they took less than a million years .
and the next , like electronics , it just seems to take a few decades .
the process <unk> ; i guess self @-@ organizing is the right word to name something that <unk> its own pace of change .
the more it changes , the faster it does .
and i think that &apos;s what we see in this explosion of the curve .
we see the process <unk> .
but i make a living by designing computers , and i know that the mechanisms that i work to make may not be possible without the recent computer advances .
but now design objects of such complexity would be impossible for me to predict it in a conventional way .
i don &apos;t know it does every transistor in that string of connections .
there are billions .
instead , with the designers of <unk> <unk> , we think of a level of abstraction , we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that you couldn &apos;t before , it gets much further and much faster than ever before .
in fact , sometimes it uses methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
a particularly interesting method i &apos;ve been using lately is evolution itself .
inside the machine , an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds .
and , for example , in the most extreme cases , we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions .
we say , &quot; for computer , can you run a hundred million random instructions ?
would you run these sequences of random instructions , running all these programs , and take those who are the ones that we want to do ? &quot;
in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to order numbers , to put a simple example .
so , we found the programs that get closer to order numbers .
of course , it &apos;s unlikely to be a random set of instructions , <unk> numbers , so none of them succeeded .
but one , fortunately , could put two numbers in the right order .
and i said , &quot; computer , could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that they did best ?
it <unk> those and <unk> the rest .
and now they were looking at the best @-@ selling numbers .
and let &apos;s go back to <unk> following an analog process to sex . &quot;
let &apos;s take two programs , let &apos;s take kids , we &apos;ll test them , and we &apos;ll test them for the two @-@ way properties .
so we got a new generation of programs that had a little bit more success .
and we say , &quot; please repeat the process . &quot;
try it again .
you put in some mutations .
and it tries again and it <unk> with another generation .
well , every generation takes a few milliseconds .
so , i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or , in complicated cases , in a few hours .
ultimately , we end up with programs that report numbers absolutely perfect .
in fact , these are much more efficient programs than i could have written by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i &apos;ve been trying to analyze it to see how they work .
these are dark programs , strange .
but they do .
in fact , i know , i have the security that they achieve the aim of , because they come from a hundred thousand of thousand programs that they did .
in fact , their life depended on doing that .
once i was on a 747 , and actually figure out a card and he says , &quot; look at this .
he says , &quot; this plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a safe flight . &quot; does it not make you feel quiet ? &quot;
we know that engineering processes don &apos;t work very well when they get complicated .
so we started to rely on computers to make very different design processes .
and that allows us to produce much more complex things than normal engineering .
however , we don &apos;t understand all the choices there are .
in that sense , it goes ahead of us .
now we use these programs to make much faster computers , so we can run these programs much faster .
i mean , it &apos;s <unk> .
the thing is getting faster and faster , and that &apos;s why i think it &apos;s so confusing .
because all these technologies were getting together .
we &apos;re <unk> .
and we &apos;re at an analog moment to the one @-@ celled organism organisms when they become multicellular .
we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t understand what the hell we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re at the tipping point .
but i think something comes behind us .
i think it would be really arrogant about our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all part of the creation of whatever comes from .
but now comes lunch , and i think i &apos;ll stop here before i get scared .
my story starts at <unk> about two years ago .
i was in the desert , under the <unk> skies , with the catholic singer <unk> ali .
we were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the former indian <unk> &quot; the mahabharata &quot; was .
in those days when the indian people wanted to travel , we wanted to travel in a car and remove the sky .
now we do it with airplanes .
at that time when <unk> , the great indian warrior , he had thirst , he was dragging out a bow and a <unk> on the ground , he was able to get water .
now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines .
the conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic .
and that gave me a lot of fun .
every time i felt a little more about myself .
i was struck by this idea of losing the capacity to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if i didn &apos;t have the camera , if i couldn &apos;t afford my friends .
it seemed to me that technology had to allow magic , do not succeed .
as a child , my grandfather gave me his silver <unk> .
and this 50 @-@ year @-@ old piece of technology was for me the most magic thing .
it became a golden door to a world full of images , of pirates and <unk> in my imagination .
i had the sense that mobile phone , luxury clocks , and the cameras keep pouring in .
we <unk> our inspiration .
so i set out , i jumped into this technological world to see how to use it to create magic , rather than owning it .
i illustrate books since the age of 16 .
so when i saw the ipad , i saw a storytelling device able to connect readers of the whole world .
you can know how we take the book .
where we are .
put the text together with the image , the animation , the sound and touch .
storytelling becomes increasingly <unk> .
but what &apos;s good for ?
i &apos;m about to launch <unk> , an interactive application for ipad .
he says , &quot; puts your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so ... <unk> : &quot; this box belongs to &quot; -- i write my name .
and so i go back to a character of the book .
in a number of moments , i have a <unk> -- the ipad knows where i live from gps -- which comes for me .
my inner girl gets excited by all these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
and i don &apos;t mean magicians and dragons , but that magic of childhood , those ideas that arise from children .
for some reason , fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me .
so , over here , we have to <unk> the ipad to unlock fireflies .
and , really , really , they light your way into what the book is .
another idea that i was fascinated with as a child was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk> galaxy .
so here , every book and every world transforms into a <unk> that i <unk> into this magic device inside the device .
and this opens up a map .
in every fantasy book , there have always been maps , but there have been <unk> maps .
this is a map that grows , <unk> and guide you through the rest of the book .
in certain points of the book , it also reveals .
now i &apos;m going to go in .
another extremely important aspect to me is to create indian content and contemporary time .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian counterparts , the <unk> ?
these poor <unk> have been trapped in the wine cameras for millennia , in an old <unk> book .
so we &apos;re bringing them back into a contemporary child history .
in a story that deals with issues like the environmental crisis .
and , speaking of the environmental crisis , one of the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked up , glued to their pcs , have not gone out into the outside world .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children out into the natural world with their technology .
one of the interactions in the book is this adventure where you have to go outside , take the camera or the ipad , and collect images from different natural objects .
as a girl , i had lots of collections : sticks , stones , <unk> and shells .
for some reason kids don &apos;t .
so , to get back this ritual of childhood , you have to go out and , in a chapter , take a picture of a flower and then proceed .
in another chapter , you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then proceed .
this is how you create a digital collection of pictures that you can then put on the web .
a kid in london puts a picture of a fox and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox . &quot;
a boy in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taken .
within the variants of connection between magic , earth and technology , there are many possibilities .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to have an interaction where one comes out with the ipad and the video is controlled and it actually sees a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inside of the house .
in a moment , the screen is full of leaves .
and you have to make the sound of the wind and the <unk> so you can read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology are coming together .
we take the energy of the sun .
we &apos;re approaching our children and ourselves into the natural world and that magic , joy and child love that we feel through a simple story .
thank you .
this is for me a real honor .
i &apos;ve spent most of the time in prisons , prisons and death row .
i &apos;ve spent most of my life in <unk> communities , in projects and places where there is so much despair .
and being here at ted , watching and listening to these stimuli has given me a lot of energy .
one of the things i &apos;ve noticed in this short time , is that ted has identity .
and the things that are said here are impact on everyone .
occasionally , if something comes from ted , it makes sense and a force that would not have otherwise .
i say this because i think identity is important .
here we &apos;ve seen fantastic presentations .
and i think we have learned that words from a teacher can make a lot of sense , but if you teach them with feeling , they can have a special meaning .
a doctor can do good things , <unk> , if it &apos;s <unk> , can do much more .
so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t really learn this in the practice of the right , my job .
i learned it from my grandmother .
i grew up in a traditional home of an african @-@ american family dominated family , which is my grandmother .
it was hard ; it was hard ; it had power .
it was the last word in the entire family .
she <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home .
he was a daughter of people who had been slaves .
his parents were born in slavery in virginia over the 1840 .
she was born on the 1880 and her experience with slavery in a way that she saw the world .
she was hard , but she was also loving .
when i was little and i looked at her , she would come up and give me a good hug .
i was so strong that i could barely breathe , and then i was overwhelmed .
one or two hours later , i would come back and look at her , and she would come up and say , &quot; <unk> , do you still feel my hug ? &quot;
and if he said no , he would take me back and he would say yes , he would leave me in peace .
i had this human quality that would always wish you to be near it .
the only problem is , i had 10 kids .
my mother was the youngest of 10 .
occasionally , when i was going to spend a time with it , it wasn &apos;t easy to catch your time and your attention .
my cousins were running all over the place .
i remember when i was eight or nine years old , i woke up one morning , i went to the room and there they were running all my cousins .
my grandmother was on the other side of the room and stare at me .
at first i thought it was a game .
so i looked at her and i looked at her , but she was very serious .
after 15 or 20 minutes , she got up , went in the room , took me out of my hand and said , &quot; you see me <unk> . we &apos;re going to discuss them . &quot;
i remember this like yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget .
it took me outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you can &apos;t tell anyone . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
she said , &quot; now you &apos;ll act that you won &apos;t . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
then he sat me down , and he said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve been looking at you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
he said , &quot; i think you can do whatever you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget .
then he said , &quot; i just want you to get me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
and he said , &quot; the first thing i want you to ask me is that we always want your mother . &quot;
he said , &quot; she &apos;s my <unk> , &quot; and you &apos;ve got to make sure you always wear her . &quot;
as i <unk> my mom , i said , &quot; yes , <unk> , i will . &quot;
then he said , &quot; the second thing i want you to ask me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing , although the right thing is difficult . &quot;
i thought about it , i said , &quot; yes , <unk> . i will . &quot;
then finally , he said , &quot; the third thing i want you to get me is that i never get alcohol . &quot;
i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , <unk> , i will . &quot;
i grew up in the field , in the south , and i have a brother a year older and a sister , a less year .
when i was 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home with a six @-@ beers , i don &apos;t know where he got it , he grabs my sister and i left to the forest .
we &apos;re just doing the crazy things all the time .
he took a sip beer , offered my sister , she took a little bit and offered me to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . you follow , but i &apos;m not going to take beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; go . come on . today you do it . and you always do the same thing as us .
i &apos;ve already taken something , your sister , too . take a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; no . i won &apos;t feel good . you can follow . &quot;
then my brother looks at me .
and he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? take a beer . &quot;
i went in and stood up , and it went , &quot; oh , it &apos;s not going to still be thinking about the conversation with <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; but what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are special . &quot;
i was terrified .
i have to admit something to you .
i &apos;ll tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t say .
i know this is widely <unk> .
but i have 52 years , and i can admit that i &apos;ve never taken a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying this by thinking it &apos;s a virtue ; i say it &apos;s in the power of identity .
when we create the right type of identity , we say things to others that really don &apos;t see sense .
we can &apos;t get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
i think my grandmother naturally believed that all her grandchildren were special .
my grandfather had been convicted during the court .
my uncles died of diseases related to alcohol .
and these were the things that , according to her , we had to commit .
now , i &apos;m going to try and talk about our criminal justice system .
this country is now very different than it was 40 years ago .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 prisoners .
today , there are 2.3 million .
in america , we have the largest incarceration rate in the world .
we have seven million people in isolation .
and this mass incarceration , in my opinion , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor , black communities , there is so much <unk> , so much despair , determined by these facts .
one out of three black people between 18 and 30 years is in jail or in liberty .
in urban <unk> across the country , los angeles , baltimore , washington , washington , 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail or in freedom .
our system is not only distorted in front of the race , but it &apos;s also about poverty .
in this country , we have a criminal system that deals you very much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty , that if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
it &apos;s not guilt ; it &apos;s wealth that affects outcomes .
and we seem to be very quiet .
the politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems with us .
we &apos;re disconnected .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
we &apos;re looking at our work , some pretty curious developments .
in my state , in alabama , just like in other states , you will be <unk> by the time if you have a criminal conviction .
right now in alabama , 34 percent of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote .
and if we toss it to the next 10 years , the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before we <unk> the law to vote .
we have this amazing silence .
i play children .
many of my clients are very young .
america is the only country in the world where children were 13 years old to die in prison .
we have in this country prison for children , unable to ever go .
right now , we &apos;re in a process of some litigation .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in the death row .
this issue of death row is interesting .
in a sense , we have <unk> to think that the ultimate question is , do people deserve to die for the ultimate <unk> ?
a very sensitive question .
but you can think differently about how we are in our identity .
there &apos;s another way to look at it : it &apos;s not about deciding whether people deserve to die for their crimes that we deserve to kill .
this is interesting .
the death penalty in america is defined by mistake .
of every nine people who have <unk> , they have identified one that is innocent that it is <unk> and released from the death row .
an error rate , amazing , innocent rate of every nine .
this is interesting .
in aviation , you would never be able to run an airplane if every nine that you would have <unk> .
but somehow we get sick of the problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these things .
i talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill .
it &apos;s interesting that in my classes with african american students , i talk about slavery .
i talk to you about terrorism , which started at the end of the reconstruction and lasted to world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know much about this .
but for black americans in this country , it was a seminal time defined by terror .
in many communities , people were afraid of being <unk> .
they were worried to be distracted .
the threat of terror was what defined their lives .
now , there are older people who come up to me and say , &quot; mr. <unk> , you &apos;re telling me , you &apos;re telling me , you &apos;re giving talks , you &apos;re going to help people say that in our history we deal with terrorism for the first time , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they ask me to say , &quot; no . say we grew up with that . &quot;
the age of terrorism went on , obviously , with <unk> and decades of rape and separation .
in this country , we have a dynamic where we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we haven &apos;t really understood what we &apos;ve done historically .
all the time it takes a few other people .
we constantly create tensions and conflicts .
it costs us to talk about races . i think it &apos;s because we &apos;re not prepared to engage us with a real and reconciliation process .
in south africa , people understood that they couldn &apos;t overcome race <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
in rwanda , even before the genocide , they had this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t .
i was in germany giving talks about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s kind of disturbing to listen to what you say . &quot;
he said , &quot; we have no death penalty in germany .
naturally , we &apos;ll never have it here . &quot;
the room was silent , and a lady said , &quot; there is no way for our story , we can never get into the systematic death of human beings .
it would be irrational that we , intentional and <unk> , we were going to run people . &quot;
tell us about this .
how would we feel in a world where a nation like germany , <unk> people , especially if they were in their majority ?
we could not tolerate it .
it would be irrational .
and yet , in this country , in the southern states , we keep running people . in the same areas where it &apos;s 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white , that if it &apos;s black , it &apos;s 22 times more likely to attack if the <unk> is black , and its <unk> is white in the same state that are buried in the people that were buried .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
i think our identity is in danger .
if we don &apos;t really care about these issues as difficult , the positive , wonderful things are , however , intractable .
we love innovation .
we &apos;re fascinated with technology . we worship creativity .
we love entertainment .
but lately , those are well @-@ versed realities for suffering , abuse , degradation , <unk> .
in my opinion , we need to integrate both things .
we talk about the need to have more hope , more engagement , more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world .
i think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor , the <unk> , the people who never get to ted .
think of them is , in a sense , something that is within our being .
it &apos;s true that we have to believe in issues that we haven &apos;t seen .
so we are . despite being so rational , so committed to intellectual .
with innovation , with creativity . development comes not just from brain ideas .
these things come from <unk> ideas , also for their heart convictions .
this connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look not only in the shining and <unk> , but also in the dark and the hard .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe suffering , we wanted all sorts of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , guidance for the spirit , a willingness to stand on sites of despair and be witnesses . &quot;
well , that guidance for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what i think is still in communities like ted , has to engage us .
there is no disconnect with technology and design , which allows us to truly be human if we don &apos;t pay attention to poverty , at <unk> , to inequality , to injustice .
now i want to warn you that these thoughts are much more challenging than if we neglect these things .
we go back to them .
i had the great privilege , being a very young lawyer , to meet <unk> <unk> .
she &apos;d come to <unk> with some frequency , to come up with two of her closest friends , some older ladies , <unk> <unk> who had <unk> the buses of <unk> , a wonderful <unk> lady , virginia , a white lady , whose husband , <unk> , was dr. king &apos;s lawyer .
these women were just getting together to talk .
occasionally , the <unk> lady would call me , &quot; <unk> , lady comes in . we &apos;ll get together to speak .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; yes . yes i want . &quot;
so she said , &quot; well , what are you going to do when you came ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so , i was going , and i just listened to them .
it was very <unk> , very <unk> .
and on one occasion , i was there , listening to these ladies , and after a couple of hours , mrs. <unk> turned to me and said , &quot; now , <unk> , that &apos;s that idea of equal justice .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and i started giving him my speech .
i said , &quot; well , we &apos;re trying to question injustice .
we try to help those who have been convicted .
we try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration .
we try to end up with life sentences , without freedom from children .
we try to do something about death penalty .
we try to reduce the population in prisons .
we try to end with massive <unk> . &quot;
i gave him all my best speech , and he finally looked at me and said , &quot; hmm . &quot;
and he said , &quot; let &apos;s march off , very much . &quot;
at that time , ms. dewey <unk> , he put my finger in the face , and he said , &quot; that &apos;s why you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
i think that actually , the ted community has to be much more structured .
we have to find a way to deal with these challenges , those problems , that suffering .
because finally , humanity depends on compassion for others .
i &apos;ve learned some very simple things in my work .
i &apos;ve been invested in simple things .
i &apos;ve come to understand and believe that every one of us is above the worst we &apos;ve ever made .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
i &apos;m convinced that if someone says a lie , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s a liar .
i &apos;m sure if you take something that doesn &apos;t belong to you , it &apos;s not that a burglar .
even if someone kills another , it &apos;s not a killer .
so i think there &apos;s a basic dignity in people who have to be <unk> by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country and , surely , many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
that &apos;s not it .
i really think a lot of the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think even though it &apos;s very dramatic , very beautiful , very <unk> , very inspiring , we will not be distracted by our technology , by our designs , not by our intellectual ability or rational ability .
ultimately , the character of a society , not because of the way the rich , powerful and privileged , but because of the way the poor people deal , the <unk> , the prisoners .
because it &apos;s in this context as we start to understand truly deep issues about what we are .
sometimes i feel <unk> . i &apos;m going to end with a story .
sometimes i make too much force .
you &apos;re tired , like everyone .
sometimes those ideas go beyond my stories into a major way .
i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk> .
i go to jail and i see my 13 and 14 @-@ year @-@ old clients who have been trained to make them as adults as adults .
and i start thinking , how can it be ?
how can a judge turn someone into what &apos;s not ?
judge <unk> him as an adult , but i see a child .
one night very late , i was thinking -- god , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , must have magical powers .
<unk> , <unk> , judge has magical powers .
you should ask for some of that .
as it was too late , i couldn &apos;t think properly , but i started working on a <unk> .
i had a 14 @-@ year @-@ old client , a little , poor , black .
i started working on the <unk> , with a <unk> who said , &quot; <unk> for my 14 @-@ year @-@ old black client to be treated like a 75 @-@ year @-@ old , ceo of a corporation . &quot;
in buddhism , i started to have <unk> behavior in the accusation , in the behavior of the police and in the process .
there was a bold line about how in this country there is no ethics , but a lot of ethics .
the next morning , i woke up thinking , was that a dream , or was i really writing it ?
for my horror , not only had it been <unk> , but he had sent to court .
it was about two months , i &apos;d already forgotten it .
and i finally decided -- oh , god , i have to go to court for this stupid case .
i got myself in the car , and i felt really overwhelmed , overwhelmed .
i went in the car to the court .
i thought this would be very difficult and scary .
i finally got off the car . i was walking to the court .
i was going up the stairs when i encountered a larger black man ; it was the court of the court .
when he saw me , he approached me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; is you a lawyer ? &quot; i said yes .
so , i was amazed and i was embarrassed .
and i <unk> in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
i have to tell you now that was rude .
that connected my background deeply , with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope .
well , i dove in the audience room .
as he walked in , the judge saw me .
and he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you write this <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; mr. i was me . &quot; and we started discussing .
people started getting there . they were all <unk> .
i was the one who had written these crazy things .
they got the police officers &apos; <unk> , the <unk> .
suddenly , not knowing how , the room was full of people , because we were talking about races , because we were talking about poverty , because we were talking about inequality .
with the <unk> of my eye , i saw the <unk> going and coming .
i was looking out the window , and i was going to hear all that <unk> .
he kept walking over here and over there .
finally , this old black man , with a <unk> of concern , came into the room and sat behind me , almost at the table of lawyers .
so , about 10 minutes later , the judge was going to hit a <unk> .
during the break , an assistant at the <unk> was shown because the <unk> had gone into the room .
the assistant <unk> over the old black .
and he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the audience ? &quot;
and the old black man stood up , looked at the assistant , looked at me and said , &quot; i walked into this audience hall to tell this young man to keep his sight on the stand @-@ up . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted today , because i think a lot of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big , but it folds into justice .
we cannot be truly human @-@ centric humans if we don &apos;t care about human rights and by dignity .
our survival is tied up with others .
that our views of technology , design , entertainment and creativity have to go to <unk> and <unk> and justice .
and above all , those of you who share this , i just want to tell you that keep your eye on the <unk> goal .
thank you very much .
you just hear , and you see an obvious desire from the audience , this community , to help in your purposes , to do something .
something that &apos;s not a check . what can we do ?
there are several near opportunities .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there will be a spring in which there will be an effort to fund the funds that are being spent today in blame policies .
for example , here in california , a billion dollars is going to spend on death row , over the next five years . a billion dollars .
and despite this , 46 percent of the cases in homicide not at all .
56 percent of the rapes do nothing .
here &apos;s an opportunity for change .
this little guy is going to propose that he <unk> these funds to get the law , to the security .
i think there &apos;s a very close opportunity .
there &apos;s been a huge spike in crime in the united states , in the last three decades .
part of the explanation is that it has to do with the biggest <unk> rate .
what would you say to those who believe it is ?
actually , the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable .
the big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes of violence .
it &apos;s the wrong war on drugs .
that &apos;s why this dramatic rise in the <unk> population arises .
and we &apos;re allowed to convince ourselves of the rhetoric .
we have three legal causes to bring people to life in life , for stealing a bicycle , for little crimes against property , rather than making those resources into their victims .
i think we have to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less .
it seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn &apos;t do anything for anyone .
i think that &apos;s the guidance that has to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve been excited today .
you &apos;re so inspiring .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
issued the threats to bin laden &apos;s death threats .
<unk> : <unk> in somalia .
<unk> 4 : <unk> posters . five : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : social decline .
<unk> : mind <unk> .
several <unk> : war for drug destruction . mass destruction .
recession . success . end judgment . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh , my god !
these are just some of the clips i got in the last six months -- you could be just the last six days or the last six years .
the idea is that press media prefer negative news because our minds are paying attention .
and that answers to a very good reason .
in every second of each day , our senses are given many more data than probably the brain can process .
and we all care more about survival , the first stop that data is an ancient passage of the temporal lobe .
the amygdala is our early warning detector , the danger detector .
it records and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us .
so , of course , a bunch of <unk> stories , looking at negative stories .
that old adage in the press , &quot; if there &apos;s blood , it sells , &quot; it &apos;s very true .
and because all digital devices provide us with negative news for the seven days of the week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not surprising to be pessimistic .
it doesn &apos;t seem to be surprised that people think the world is going wrong .
but maybe it &apos;s not .
perhaps , instead , what happens is we actually get <unk> .
perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades .
i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our good problems : climate change , species extinction , water scarcity and energy ; we certainly have them .
as human beings , we &apos;re very good at solving problems and , in the long run , we &apos;ve just come up with them .
so let &apos;s look at what happened in the last century to see where we &apos;re going .
in the last hundred years , the average life has been more than doubled , the average per capita income for inflation has tripled throughout the world .
child mortality has reduced 10 times .
also , the cost of food , electricity , transportation and communications , has fallen 10 to 1,000 times .
steve pinker showed that we are living the most peaceful times in human history .
and charles berry : the world &apos;s literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we &apos;re actually living an extraordinary time .
a lot of people forget it .
and we continue to have higher expectations .
in fact , we emphasize the meaning of poverty .
think about it , today in america , a lot of the people living under the poverty line have electricity , water , toilets , <unk> , television , air @-@ conditioning and cars .
the rubber <unk> from the last century , the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such luxury .
supporting a lot of this is technology and , lately , its exponential growth .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve , moore &apos;s law , and double the price performance over 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone that &apos;s in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a 70 @-@ year @-@ old supercomputer .
now look at this curve .
it &apos;s moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
i want you to look at two things on this curve .
first , how smooth it is -- in good and bad times , in war and peace , in recession , in depression and rise .
it &apos;s the end of fast computers used to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t stop at all big challenges .
and even though he &apos;s stuck in a law on the left , the curve goes up .
the growth rate of technology is actually getting faster and faster .
and on this curve , moore &apos;s law , there &apos;s a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today .
the computation in the cloud , which my friends from autodesk call infinite computation , sensors and networks , robotics , 3d printing and its capacity to democratize and distributed personalized production throughout the planet , synthetic biology , fuels , vaccines and food , digital medicine , digital medicine , <unk> and ai .
i mean , how many of you saw the victory in &quot; jeopardy , &quot; from ibm ?
it was epic .
i looked in the newspaper the best headline i would have .
and i love this one : &quot; watson <unk> to human opponents . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy is not an easy game .
play with the nuances of human language .
imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud , available for everyone in the mobile phone .
four years ago , here at ted , ray kurzweil and i , launched a new university called <unk> university .
we teach these technologies to our students , and in particular , how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask them to release a company , or a product or service , which can really affect the lives of a billion people in a decade .
think about that , the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people .
30 years ago , that would have been absurd .
we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done that .
when i think about creating abundance , it doesn &apos;t mean creating life for every single planet -- it &apos;s about creating a life of what &apos;s possible .
it &apos;s about taking that thing which is scarce and making it plentiful .
you see , scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources .
let me give you an example .
it &apos;s a story of napoleon in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited dinner the king of <unk> .
the troops ate napoleon with silver , and the same napoleon , with gold <unk> .
but the king of <unk> , ate covered in aluminum .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet ; it was worth more than gold and platinum .
that &apos;s why the tip of the washington pump is aluminum .
you see , although aluminum is <unk> percent of the mass of the earth , it doesn &apos;t come as pure metal .
it &apos;s tied up with oxygen and <unk> .
but then the <unk> came in and made it out of aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it were <unk> .
it <unk> this analogy towards the future .
think about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re on a planet , bathed 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
they come to earth 16 <unk> of energy every morning .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , it &apos;s about affordability .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , the cost of solar energy in india is 50 percent less than the fuel produced : <unk> rupees versus 17 .
the cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year .
last month , the mit published a study that shows that in the late 1900s , in the parts of america , solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents of the national average .
and if we have plenty of energy , we also have plenty of water .
let &apos;s talk about the wars over the water .
do you remember when carl sagan pointed the voyager spacecraft to earth in 1990 , after saturn ?
he took a famous picture . what was he called ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water .
yes , <unk> percent is salt water , two percent is ice , and we fight for half percent of the water on the planet , but here &apos;s also hope .
it &apos;s a technology that &apos;s available not 10 or 20 years , but right now .
nanotechnology comes with <unk> .
in a conversation with dean kamen this morning , one of the innovators in the <unk> -- i &apos;d like to share with you , gave me permission to do this -- his technology called <unk> <unk> -- is the size of a small refrigerator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water a day of any salt source , contaminated water , a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon .
the ceo of coke has just <unk> that will do an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world .
if that comes right , and i have a full confidence that it will be , coke will globally , globally , globally , countries on the planet .
this is a <unk> innovation that is out there today .
and we &apos;ve seen it in mobile phones .
my god , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013 .
think about it , that masai warrior has better cell communications in the middle of kenya than president reagan 25 years ago .
and , having a smartphone with google , it has access to more knowledge and information that president clinton 15 years ago .
he lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could ever have predicted .
better than that , the things that you and i have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video , armed images , libraries of books and music , diagnostic technology -- are now <unk> and lost market value with mobile phones .
maybe the best thing comes when the health care applications come .
last month , i had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> foundation something called the <unk> x prize , 10 million dollars .
we &apos;re challenging the equipment in the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that you &apos;re talking about , and because you have ai , you can get blood out of your finger .
to win , it has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team .
imagine this device in the developing world where there are no doctors , where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent , and there are 1.3 percent of the health care workers .
when this device <unk> a rna or dna virus that doesn &apos;t recognize , it will ring at the fda , and , in the first place , it will make a pandemic happen .
but this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance .
i call it the billion increase .
the white lines over here are the population .
we just went through seven billion .
by the way , the best protection against the demographic explosion is to provide the world of education and health .
in 2010 , we had less than two billion people online , connected .
by 2020 , it will happen two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion minds have never known before that add up to the global conversation .
what do these people want ?
what a <unk> ? what wishes you have ?
and instead of economic collapse , we &apos;ll have the greatest economic injection of history .
these people represent tens of billions of dollars living in the global economy .
and <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> , better education with the khan academy and because of the use of 3d impressions and cloud computing , they &apos;ll be more productive than ever before .
what can you provide 3,000 million more members of humanity , healthy , productive ?
how about some voices we never had before ?
what if we give them to the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time ?
what are these three billion ?
what if they &apos;re contributions we cannot predict ?
something that i learned with the x prize is that small teams , led by their passion with a clear goal , can do extraordinary things , things that could only do big things and corporations .
i &apos;m going to end by sharing a story that really got me excited .
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
it &apos;s called foldit .
he came up at the university of washington , in seattle .
it &apos;s a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein behaves .
the folds determine the structure and the functionality .
it &apos;s a very important thing in medical research .
and , up until now , it was a supercomputer problem .
they &apos;ve played with this college professors , among others .
then hundreds of thousands of people got angry and started playing .
and it &apos;s been shown today that the human @-@ pattern recognition machinery is better at <unk> proteins than the best computers .
and these people were looking at the best protein <unk> in the world , and i wasn &apos;t teaching at mit , i wasn &apos;t even learning at caltech ; it was a person from england , in manchester , a woman who , during the day , was a ceo worker at a rehabilitation clinic and , at night , was the best <unk> of protein in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in the future is that we now have more power as people to take on the grand challenges of the planet .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
we have the passion of <unk> .
we have <unk> capital .
and we have 3,000 billion new minds that are focused on the solution of big challenges and doing what we should do .
we have for a few very extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something with a part of healthcare culture that needs to change .
and i think this starts with a doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and i &apos;ve spent enough time on my fake prestige about that .
before i try my talk , let &apos;s talk a little bit about baseball .
why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , the world cup begins .
we love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of amazing statistics .
there are hundreds of statistics .
it &apos;s about getting &quot; <unk> the rules , &quot; it talks about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team .
i &apos;m focusing on one of them , and i hope many of you will know it .
it &apos;s called the <unk> average .
and we talk about 300 , of a <unk> that will infect 300 .
that means that <unk> is effectively three out of 10 times .
that means throwing the ball into the playing field without being caught , and anyone who tries to throw it out at the very first base , doesn &apos;t get there in time , and the second base will be thrown out .
three attempts at 10 .
do you know how they call a 300 @-@ light <unk> in the great plains ?
well , really good , maybe of the equipment of stars .
do you know what they call a 400 @-@ year baseball <unk> ?
by the way , that &apos;s someone who , 10 strokes , gets it four .
legendary -- like the legendary ted williams , the last players at the democratic league of <unk> to run more 400 hits in a regular season .
now , i &apos;m going to link this to my world of medicine , where i feel much more comfortable , or maybe less uncomfortable , after what i &apos;m going to tell you today .
suppose you have <unk> and you &apos;re derivatives of a surgeon who also has a four @-@ way record on the fly .
that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
now suppose you live in a remote place , and a loved one has two coronary arteries , and your family doctor is heading to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 .
but , you know something ?
she &apos;s dramatically improving this year .
and his <unk> have been <unk> .
this is not working .
but let them tell you .
what do you think it should be the average <unk> of a heart surgeon or orthopedic surgeon , of a nurse or a thousand , very well .
and the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows about a good surgeon , a doctor or a <unk> .
what we do , however , is we <unk> the world , and i include myself , with the mandate of being perfect .
never , ever , ever mind me making a mistake and trying to figure out how to do it well .
that was the message i was going to get when i was in medical college .
i was a obsessive student .
once , a fellow in high school said that brian goldman sachs studied to a blood test .
just like that .
i studied in my little <unk> , in the nurses &apos; chief hospital in toronto , not far from here .
and i learned everything from memory .
out of my kind of anatomy , <unk> the origin and the work of muscle , the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the aorta , the regular diagnosis and the usual .
and i even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify kidney <unk> .
and as long as we gather more and more knowledge .
and i went really well ; i graduated with <unk> .
and he <unk> from the medical school with the impression that if he <unk> everything , then he would know everything , or as close as he can , close to everything , because so i get tired of mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met the madame <unk> .
i was a resident in a university hospital here , in toronto , when they brought the lady to the emergency service where i was working .
at the time , i was welcomed in cardiology .
and when emergencies requested a bribe , i was able to attend that patient .
and it inform the boss &apos;s boss .
when i saw the madame <unk> , i was <unk> .
i heard a <unk> sound .
and when i rescued it , i heard a sound <unk> on both sides , which indicate to me heart failure .
in these conditions , the heart stops working , and instead of injecting the blood into the stem , the blood goes into the lungs , they fill in the blood , and that &apos;s why there &apos;s a difficulty breathing .
and it wasn &apos;t hard to diagnose .
i did , and i started working on the treatment i would give .
i gave him aspirin and medication to help alleviate the pressure in his heart .
i gave her <unk> , water pills , so she could remove liquid .
and in an hour or two , she started feeling better .
and i felt really good .
and that &apos;s when i made the first mistake , i sent her home .
i actually made two more mistakes .
i sent her home without talking to her boss .
i didn &apos;t get up the phone , i didn &apos;t do what i should have done , which was to call my boss , and i <unk> it with him so he saw it .
and if my boss would have seen it , it would have been able to provide pure information .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a conductor who was always paying attention .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibilities , that i could take care of my patients without even reaching my boss .
the second mistake i made was worse .
when i send her home , i will not pay attention to a voice in my inner world that said , &quot; goldman sachs , that &apos;s not a good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i was so insecure that i even asked the nurse who was taking care of the lady , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay if you &apos;re home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought , and then she said , &quot; yes , i think it &apos;ll be okay . &quot;
i remember that as it was yesterday .
so , i signed the high , and the ambulance next to the residents drove her home .
and i went back to the hospital room .
the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had a bad <unk> in the stomach .
but i did follow my job .
at the end of the day , i set out to leave the hospital and i walked into the parking lot where my car was going home . at the time i did something i don &apos;t normally do .
i went through the guidance service at home .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not the one who was taking care of the lady before , but another . she told me three words , those three words that most emergency physicians fear .
other specialists who are also afraid of it , but there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> , and that is that we see the patients <unk> .
the three words are : does it remember you ?
&quot; does it remember the patient who sent home ? &quot;
he asked the other nurse full .
&quot; well , she went back , &quot; with the same voice tone .
she was fine .
but he went back and on the brink of death .
after an hour of having arrived at his house , after i gave him the high , he suffered a collapse and his family called 911 ; the ambulance <unk> with a 50 @-@ millimeter pressure , which means severe shock .
i was barely breathing , and i was blue .
emergency staff are driving all their resources .
they gave her medication to raise her blood pressure .
and they put an artificial <unk> .
i was <unk> and <unk> to the marrow .
he had a mix of feelings , because after he got it , he was in intense therapy and he hoped against all the hope that he would get tired .
and in the next two or three days , it was obvious that they never cooked .
it had a permanent brain damage .
the family gathered together .
and in eight to nine days , he was facing what was going on .
and at the ninth day , they let her go . mrs. <unk> , wife , mother and grandmother .
they say they never forget the names of those who die .
that was my first experience .
the next few weeks , i was struck by it , and i experienced this for the first time that there is a shame that exists in our medical culture , and i was lonely , and i didn &apos;t feel that healthy , because you can &apos;t relate to your colleagues .
you know , you know that health state when you ask the best friend to write a secret that they promised to save , and you discover that . so your friend is facing him , and you have a terrible argument , but at the end , that disgusting feeling is his <unk> , and you can admit that he never <unk> that error .
you make peace and you never make that mistake .
that &apos;s a shame that leaves a teaching .
the shame that i &apos;m talking about is what makes us feel very bad inside .
it &apos;s the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong , but we &apos;re bad .
and that felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for my boss ; he was a <unk> .
he spoke to me with the family , and i &apos;m sure he <unk> things and made sure he didn &apos;t get me wrong .
and i kept asking these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask my boss ? why did i send her home ?
and in my worst moments , why was i making such dumb error ?
why did i choose medicine ?
slowly that feeling was <unk> .
and i started feeling better .
and on a rainy day , the sky opened and finally the sun came out . and i wondered if i &apos;d feel better again .
and i did a deal with myself in which , if i put the efforts to be perfect , to make no more mistakes , i would cheat those voices .
and so it was .
i went back to work .
but it did happen again .
two years later , i was an assistant at the emergency department in a community hospital in northern toronto , and i got a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man with a pain in his throat .
i was very busy .
and he <unk> over here .
i looked at his throat , he was kind of angry .
i <unk> penicillin and i sent him home .
but while he was running at the door , he was still pointing his throat .
two days later , when i came to do my <unk> change , my boss asked me to talk to me about his office .
and he made the three words : does it remember you ?
do you remember the patient who saw from a pain in your throat ?
so he went back and he didn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
he had a potentially fatal condition called <unk> .
you can search for google . it &apos;s an infection , not from the throat , but from the upper air force , and it can cause the closing of those roads .
he , fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he <unk> antibiotics through <unk> , and he recovered at the very few days .
and i took the same period of shame and <unk> , then i moved back and went back to work , until it happened over and over again , and again .
twice at the same emergency rate , <unk> <unk> .
and it &apos;s a big effort , especially working in a hospital , because it &apos;s 14 patients at the same time .
but in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s been a <unk> .
one of them thought i had a kidney calculation .
he downloaded an x @-@ ray of kidneys , but it turned out to be normal -- a colleague that was looking at the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the lower right quadrant and called the surgeon .
the other patient was with a lot of diarrhea .
i <unk> her liquid for <unk> , and i asked my colleague to fix it .
he <unk> it , and he noticed some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant , called the surgeon .
both of these were operated and they recovered well .
but every case i get tired , i <unk> .
but i would like to tell you that i made the worst errors in the first five years of exercise , and as many colleagues say , it &apos;s a mess .
the most significant have been over the last five years .
only , shame and no support .
and here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t go back and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the <unk> that tells me what really happens , how can i share this with my colleagues ?
how do i teach them this so that they don &apos;t make the same mistakes ?
if i now started a place like this , i would have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failing , after failure , after failure ?
of course , at a party , you &apos;ll hear about the mistakes of other physicians , but you won &apos;t hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
if he started a room full of colleagues now , if he asked them for support and telling them what i just told you , he would not have to come to the second story before he started screaming , someone would make a joke , they would change and they would follow .
and if i knew and my colleagues too , that a <unk> in my hospital would shake the wrong leg , believe i would have difficulties in my eyes .
this is the system that we have .
complete denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s the system in which there are two positions : those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t -- those who cannot sleep and those who do ; those who have a lousy outcome and those who have great results .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like antibodies that starts to attack that person .
we have the idea that if you step back from medicine to people who make mistakes , you will stay in a safe system .
but that brings two problems .
in 20 years , approximately a spread and medical journalism , i have done a healthcare staff study and medical failures to learn how possible , from the very first paper i wrote to toronto , &quot; white , <unk> , art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous .
we work in a system where mistakes happen every single day , where one out of 10 drugs locked up in the hospital is wrong , or <unk> is not right . in a system where hospital acquired infection is getting more and more , and more numerous , causing chaos and death .
in this country , 24 / 7 dying of <unk> medical errors .
the u.s. medical institute set out 100,000 .
in both cases , this is <unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re not <unk> the problem as we should .
and so there are things .
a holistic system where knowledge grew up every two or three years , and we didn &apos;t get distracted .
sleep deprivation is <unk> .
and we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have cognitive biases that allow you to do a perfect history of a patient with pain in their chest .
now , let &apos;s take the same patient with a chest pain , it &apos;s <unk> with <unk> eyes and with breath for alcohol and , all of a sudden , my story is <unk> .
it &apos;s not the same story .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things always .
and my patients are not cars . they don &apos;t always have their symptoms in the same way .
all over this , mistakes are inevitable .
so , if we take the system as we were taught , and eliminate all the professionals would be wrong , well , no one will stay .
and what about people not wanting to talk about their most serious cases ?
in my program , &quot; <unk> black , black art , &quot; now it &apos;s a custom to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; i would tell all of you , from the <unk> to the head of cardiac surgery : &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah -- what are your mistakes ? &quot; and <unk> the microphone into them .
and his students would be wondering , <unk> , <unk> his head and <unk> saliva and would start telling his stories .
they want to tell their stories , they want to share them .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake . &quot;
they need a context where they can do it .
they need a medical culture .
and he begins with a physician every time .
so , <unk> is human ; you know , human ; you accept it , and you don &apos;t enjoy their mistakes , but you try to learn from what &apos;s happened to teach others .
they share their experiences with them .
it &apos;s support for those who talk about their mistakes .
it points out the errors of other people , not with the intent of <unk> , but in a way of loving and support for everyone to get sick .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system , and when this happens , they make mistakes rather than when .
but the system is evolving to create <unk> that will allow you to spot in a simple way those mistakes that inevitably make humans . and also promote the support and the love , spaces from where you see in the healthcare system , you can find potential errors and be rewarded for that , particularly people like me , so that we can make mistakes by <unk> for them .
my name is brian goldman sachs .
i &apos;m a christian doctor .
i &apos;m human ; i make mistakes .
and i &apos;m so sorry , but i &apos;m hard to learn something that i can convey to others .
i don &apos;t know what they think about me yet , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three personal words : i remember it .
i &apos;m going to talk about a very small idea .
the <unk> of the starting point .
and as the idea can be explained in a minute , before i &apos;ll give you three examples to make time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
he was here , as you know , <unk> .
you probably think it was <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t .
he actually would pick fish .
and he described one of them as very common .
it was just pure .
they were sweating a lot to the 1880 decade .
now , the fish is in the red array of the iucn .
but we &apos;ve heard this story many times , about the galapagos and elsewhere , so that has nothing special .
but the thing is , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re <unk> .
the <unk> still say it &apos;s intact .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
second story , it also illustrates another concept : the shifting of the waist .
because i was there in 1971 studying a lagoon in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe , and then i wanted to work in africa .
i thought it could be wrong .
i was very pleased with the sun , and i was convinced that i wasn &apos;t there .
this is my first exhibition to the sun .
the lagoon was surrounded by <unk> , and , as you can see , of a mangroves .
there were about 20 inches , black beard <unk> .
and the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and was <unk> for a very good time , so he would win more than half in ghana .
when i was there 27 years later , the number of fish had fallen in half .
we went to five inches .
they experienced a genetic pressure .
there were still fish .
in a way , they were still happy .
and the fish were still happy to be there .
i mean , nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third story is , i was introduced in the introduction of <unk> fishing in southeast asia .
in the 1970s , well , it started in europe &apos;s <unk> .
development <unk> was trying to implement countries that had 100,000 fishermen already , <unk> industrial fishing .
and this boat , pretty ugly , called the <unk> 4 .
i went out and fishing in him , and we did studies in the south of the china sea and , above all , in the java sea .
what we captured there was something <unk> .
we capture , now i know , the bottom of the sea .
90 percent of what we capture were sponges , other animals that are in the background .
and most of the fish are the tiny blobs of these things , the remains that are coral reefs .
in short , the bottom of the sea came on the deck and then it was <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary , because transition is very fast .
in a year , you do a study and then you start commercial fishing .
the background is going to be a solid coral deep , soft coral in this case , to be a <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat them . they ate them because they were dead .
we once captured a life .
i was still not pregnant .
so they wanted to eat it because it was a good food .
this mountain of remains is what fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they never have fish .
but it &apos;s not documented .
we turn the world , but we don &apos;t remember .
i &apos;m going to take the starting point , the new level , not to remember what was there .
if you look at this , something like this .
on the y @-@ axis , we have good things : biodiversity , the number of killer whales , the <unk> of the country , the water supply .
and that changes over time . it changes because people do things with sadness .
every generation of images that &apos;s been trained in the beginning of their conscious life like normal and <unk> it forward .
the difference is that they experience loss .
but they don &apos;t perceive the loss that happened before .
you can analyze the set of changes .
and in the end , it keeps some <unk> .
and that , largely , is what we want to do now .
we want to keep things that are no longer , or they &apos;re not what they were .
but you should think that this problem impacts people when societies kill animals without knowing what they &apos;ve done to a few generations later .
because obviously , an animal that &apos;s so abundant , before it &apos;s extinct , it &apos;s kind of frequent .
you don &apos;t lose existing animals .
you lose small animals .
even if this doesn &apos;t feel like a big loss .
over time , we focus on big animals , and a sea synonymous with big fish .
they become unusual because the <unk> .
over time , we have a few fish , but we think that &apos;s the starting point .
and the question is , why do we accept this ?
well , because we don &apos;t know it was different .
in fact , a lot of people , scientists , argued that it was very different .
and they will do it because the evidence introduced in an earlier way is not the way that they would expect evidence to be .
for example , the anecdote that some of us have , as a captain and just observed many fish in this area can &apos;t be used or , by and large , they don &apos;t use fishing scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
so , we have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in civilized societies , because they don &apos;t rely on the sources of the past .
that &apos;s the huge piece of paper that can deliver a protected ocean area .
because with the marine protected areas , we actually create the past .
so , we think back to this past that people can &apos;t imagine , because the starting point has gone and is extremely low .
that &apos;s for the people who can see a protected ocean zone and can benefit from vision that provides , which allows them to delete their starting point .
and what about the people who can &apos;t do it because they have no access , like the people in the midwest , for example ?
i think the arts and film can probably fill in the vacuum . simulation .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were gray whales in chesapeake bay , 500 years ago .
and you may have noticed that the nuances and the <unk> are like &quot; avatar &quot; .
and if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were moved with the film -- let &apos;s talk about the story of <unk> -- why would you interact with images ?
because it raises something that , in a sense , has lost .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is cameron , &quot; avatar , &quot; underwater .
thank you very much .
in the &apos; 80s , in east germany , if you had a typewriter , you had to write it down to government .
you had to register a piece of text for example written with the machine .
and this so that the government could track the origin of texts .
if they found a script with the wrong message , they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea .
in the west , we don &apos;t think that someone could do this , how much this would undermine the freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our countries .
but today , in 2011 , if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer and prints a page , that page will end up having some yellow dots on every page that follows a pattern that makes you one and its own printer .
that &apos;s happening today .
and nobody seems a lot about this .
this is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us , citizens .
and it &apos;s one of the three main causes of problems in the network .
if we look at what happens in the online world , we can set up the attacks according to their attackers .
there are three major groups .
there are <unk> .
like mr. <unk> &apos;s city of <unk> , in ukraine .
the <unk> cell is very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use cyber weapons to make a lot of money , enormous amounts .
there are actually many cases of <unk> , <unk> , that will raise money with their attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> , of estonia , estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
this is stephen hansen .
this is <unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> al @-@ <unk> and so on and so forth .
these guys are doing their <unk> online , but they &apos;re doing it for illegal means using banking to steal money from our bills when we buy online , or they steal our keys to get information from our boards when we buy a computer infected computer .
the secret service of america , two months ago , <unk> the swiss account of this gentleman , sam jain , and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain <unk> : his <unk> is over .
and i say that today is more likely than any of us to be a victim of a real crime .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to happen worse .
in the future , most crimes will come online .
the second group of prescription weapons in importance that we observe today is not motivated by the money .
there &apos;s another thing that moves them , they motivate the protests , they motivate their opinions , they motivate them all the laughter .
groups like <unk> have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a leading role in online attacks .
those are the three leading attackers : the criminals who do it for money , the <unk> as <unk> , who make it for granted , and the last group are national states that attack .
and then we see cases like <unk> .
that &apos;s a good example of government attack against its own citizens .
<unk> is an authority of the netherlands , or indeed , it was .
he declared bankrupt the last fall because of a <unk> .
it <unk> the safety of the site and it <unk> a <unk> .
last week , i asked , in a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders if they started <unk> the death of people because of the attack <unk> .
and the answer of him was yes .
so , how does people die of a attack from these ?
<unk> is a <unk> authority .
they sell a certificate .
what do they serve for ?
well , you need , if you have a website with <unk> , services like <unk> , services like gmail .
now all of us , or almost all of us , use gmail or some of their competitors , but these services are very popular in <unk> states like iran in which dissidents by foreign services like this , because they know that they are more reliable than local services and are embedded in connections so that the local government can &apos;t deal with them .
unless you translate a foreign authority .
and he <unk> a <unk> .
and in the <unk> case that happened exactly .
and what happened in the arab spring and those things that have happened , for example , in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the protesters who did the secret police headquarters in april , 2011 , and during the <unk> of the building , they found a lot of papers .
amongst those papers was this folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and inside that folder , there were notes from a company based on germany that had sold the egyptian government , egyptian tools to intercept the great scale of the communications of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company &apos;s headquarters are right here .
so , western governments provide tools for governments to train them to do this to their citizens .
but western governments also do this themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , the <unk> was found -- a <unk> used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a good criminal case , it &apos;s pretty obvious that your phone is <unk> .
but today it goes further .
it <unk> the internet connection .
they use even tools like the <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication , and listen to online arguments to get our data .
when we think about things like this , the obvious answer should be , &quot; well , it sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m an honest citizen .
why worry ?
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s in play privacy .
privacy is not arguing .
it &apos;s not a question of privacy versus safety .
it &apos;s about freedom versus control .
if we could well rely on our governments today in 2011 , any right that we will use today will forever .
in any future government , in a administration that we could have within 50 years ?
these are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years .
this may seem strange , but i &apos;m a huge <unk> of the concrete block .
the first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea : cement modules of a fixed measurement that fit together .
very quickly , these became the most construction unit used in the world .
they have allowed us to build bigger things that we , like buildings or bridges , a brick at a time .
essentially , these blocks have become the pillars of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , <unk> came to mind .
he was called the automatic assembly brick .
and in a few years , the building blocks of <unk> came to all the homes .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges , buildings or homes .
lego made it accessible .
lego just took off the concrete block , the favorite part of the world , and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination .
meanwhile , exactly that same year , in the bell labs , the next big revolution was about to say , the new building block .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of bricks that would take a few more to a world where everything was interactive .
just like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to create much bigger and more complex circuits , a brick at a time .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
i don &apos;t personally accept that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts , so i decided to change it .
eight years ago , when i was at the media lab , i started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
i &apos;m going to show you how they work .
<unk> are electronics each and a specific function .
they &apos;re wired to be light , sound , engines and sensors .
and the cool thing about it is , they unite through magnets .
so you can &apos;t get it wrong .
the bricks have a code of colors .
the green is the output , the blue is the stream , the pink is the input and the orange one is the wire .
so you just have to assemble a blue one with a green one , and very quickly you can start doing big circuits .
a blue one with a green one is making light .
we can put a button in the middle , so we have a regulator probe .
if we change the button for a pulse module , which is here , and now we have a light bulb .
we add this <unk> to create more impact , and we have a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop this .
so beyond the simple game , <unk> is actually very powerful .
instead of having to program , connecting and self @-@ centered , it allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
to make your blink faster or slower , you simply turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing collection .
we want all the interactions in the world to go into bricks that are ready to use .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors ; everything has to be accessible .
we &apos;ve given the kids to watch them play with them .
and it &apos;s been an amazing experience .
the cool thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics of every day that you don &apos;t learn in schools .
for example , how does a light at night , or why the front door of an elevator stay open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also taken <unk> to design schools .
so , for example , designers without any experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material .
here you can see , with paper bottles and <unk> , we have <unk> , creating ...
a few weeks ago , we took <unk> to the designers at rhode island school of design , which have no experience in engineering , <unk> in cardboard , wood and <unk> and said , &quot; make something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that you &apos;ve done , a cannon , powered by motion .
but wait , here comes my favorite project .
it &apos;s a locust made in play @-@ dough that is afraid of the darkness .
for these non @-@ engineers , <unk> became another material , electronics became another material .
and we want this material to be at the reach of everyone .
so , <unk> has open source .
you can visit the website , download all the design files and throw it away .
we want to encourage a world of creators , inventors and collaborators , because this world we live in , this interaction world , is ours .
so go ahead and invent .
thank you .
