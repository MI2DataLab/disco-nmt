one day the los angeles <unk> steve times was walking across the streets of los angeles streets when he heard a beautiful music .
he came from a man , a very lovely , <unk> man , hard face , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
i &apos;m telling you a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s column was the basis for a book that then became a film , with robert <unk> , acting like steve <unk> and jamie <unk> , like nathaniel <unk> , who &apos;s trained in <unk> whose promising race was <unk> by a tragic <unk> of schizophrenia .
nathaniel quit <unk> , he suffered a total and 30 years later he was living on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles .
i encourage you to read the book by steve or look at the film to understand not just the beautiful bond that was created between these two men , but how music helped to shape that link , and finally played a useful role to help nathaniel out the streets .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
he had just heard an interpretation of the first and fourth symphony by beethoven and came behind the stage to present .
i was speaking in a very <unk> and social way about me @-@ yo @-@ yo ma and hillary , and how the palace never would go to the world , all because of the performance of the first violin ticket in the last game by beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
and we talk about music , and a few days later , i got an electronic mail saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , i have to mention that nathaniel denies the treatment , because when he was treated by <unk> shock therapy , <unk> and wives , and that scar has remained in his entire life .
but as a result now , it &apos;s going to be prone to these schizophrenics , and the worst episode can be measured by him exploding and then disappearing for days , <unk> by the streets of skid row , exposed to his <unk> , with the <unk> of his own mind without control .
and nathaniel was in such a state of turmoil when we started our first lesson in the walt disney hall who had a kind of flash <unk> in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was sleeping with him .
and i felt fear , not for me , but fear that i was going to lose it , that i was going to sink in one of his states and that i would raise his relationship to the violin if i started talking to scales and some other ways of pedagogy <unk> for the violin .
so i just started playing .
and i played the first move of beethoven &apos;s violin .
and as i felt that a profound change was happening in nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if i was under control of some unseen drug , a chemical reaction , for which i played music was its catalyst .
and cholera that was transformed into understanding , into a sit curiosity and in grace .
and as a miracle , he raised his own violin , and he began to touch some clips of concerts for a violin , which then asked me to join , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , from bach all the way to beethoven and brahms , <unk> , all the <unk> , all the way down to that <unk> .
and i understood that he had not only a <unk> knowledge of music , but he shared it with this music at a personal level .
he talked about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man became from the paranoid man who had come from walking the streets of the center of los angeles to the very lovely , scholar , brilliant , educated musician @-@ born music .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is mine .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and his delusions and turn through his imagination and his creativity actually .
and this is an escape from his <unk> state .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the real reason why we make music , that we take something that exists within all of us , in our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we are able to transform those emotions actually .
and the reality of that expression hits us all , it moves us , it inspires us and binds us .
and for nathaniel , the music brought him back to the group of friends .
the <unk> power of music came back to the family of musicians who understood it , who recognized their talents and respected him .
and i will always make music with nathaniel , whether we &apos;re in the walt disney hall , or on skid row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta magazine .
robert gupta : i want to play something that without some embarrassment of the <unk> .
so please excuse me .
so i &apos;ve met a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve only loved two .
the first was more like a passionate romance .
it was a beautiful , tasty fish , with texture , <unk> , a <unk> in the menu .
fish .
even better , he was raised with the highest <unk> of sustainability .
so you could feel good at selling .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , he called the chief of the company , and he asked if i would talk in an event about sustainability <unk> .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve this problem for our chefs that had been called a suicide tornado , like we keep fish in our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we were fishing in the shallow seas in the same way as our forest <unk> .
it &apos;s hard to get rid of destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the salmon , the swordfish , all collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for good or for worse , <unk> , fish parenting , will be part of our future .
there are many arguments against it . fish <unk> , at least most of them do , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take the example of tuna . a bigger disadvantage .
it has a 15 @-@ to @-@ one food conversion .
this means that you need 15 pounds of wild fish in order to get a kilo of <unk> .
it &apos;s not very sustainable .
it &apos;s also not very tasty .
so here , finally , there was a company trying to do the right thing .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the pr superintendent of the company .
don <unk> .
&quot; gift , &quot; i said , &quot; only to have the facts for clear , you are famous for raising so far sea inside , not <unk> . &quot;
he said , &quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far away , that the waste of our fish distribute , they don &apos;t concentrate . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world in itself .
was that food conversion ? 2.5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best at <unk> . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what are they feeding them ? &quot;
<unk> proteins , &quot; he told me .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . and we &apos;ll fix the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , right before the event , i called him don .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he told me he didn &apos;t know . i &apos;d say over there .
well , i spoke on the phone with some people in the company . nobody could give me a direct answer , until i finally spoke on the phone with the <unk> in charge .
let &apos;s call it don .
&quot; gift , &quot; i said , &quot; what are these examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish food , and then he said chicken <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> chicken ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone , remains , <unk> and minerals in food . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of the food is chicken ? &quot;
think , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you have sustainable <unk> to feed the fish chicken ? &quot;
there was a long silence in the line , and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i got tired of this fish .
no , not because it &apos;s some gourmet <unk> .
i really am .
no , i actually got into this fish because , i swear to god , that after that conversation , fish had a taste of chicken .
the second fish , is another kind of love story .
the romantic guy , the guy you know the fish , the more you love the fish .
i ate it for the first time in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine was talking about this fish for a long time .
somehow she organized our first date .
he came to the table of a white color , of course , and almost <unk> .
the chef had gone on fire .
type twice .
incredibly , it was just delicious .
can you make a fish @-@ like fish that are rich after being so rich ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
call him michelangelo . actually his name <unk> michelangelo .
and no , he &apos;s not <unk> the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way we understand him and i .
it &apos;s a biologist running the palm .
it &apos;s a fish <unk> on the <unk> @-@ west edge of spain .
it &apos;s at the very end of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , the <unk> was in the hands of <unk> .
it also <unk> cows in what they were essentially <unk> .
they managed to <unk> the earth .
they built this <unk> series of canals , and crossed the water into the ground into the river .
well , they didn &apos;t make it work , not in any economic way .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed something like 90 percent of the birds , which for a place like this , are many birds .
and then back in 1982 , a spanish company with an environmental awareness bought the earth .
what did they do ?
they inverted the flows of water .
it literally <unk> the switch .
instead of pushing the water out , used the canals to attract the water into .
we channel channels .
they created a <unk> of pack @-@ acre fish -- <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and in the process , michelangelo and his company <unk> the whole ecological destruction .
<unk> is amazing .
i mean , they never saw something like this .
you look at the horizon that &apos;s about a million miles away , and you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s <unk> channels and this <unk> and rich swamp .
i was there not a long time with michelangelo .
it &apos;s an amazing guy , three charles darwin and a <unk> part .
ok ? so , there we are <unk> over the swamp , and i &apos;m <unk> and <unk> with mud at the height of my knees , and michelangelo is doing this with a biology conference .
here &apos;s a <unk> black @-@ <unk> .
now , there &apos;s a quote of the mineral needs of the <unk> .
and here , here he is looking at a pattern of clustering that makes him remind the <unk> of tanzania .
turns out , michelangelo spent most of his career in <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became an expert in fish .
he said , &quot; did i know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then he starts talking again about strange birds and algae and strange plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community out that kind of thing .
it &apos;s fantastic , but i was in love .
and my head was bathed in that piece of delicious fish .
so , i said , &quot; michelangelo , which makes your fish so tasty ? &quot;
he showed me the algae .
&quot; i know , <unk> , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it &apos;s amazing .
but , are you eating your fish ?
what is the food conversion rate ? &quot;
well , it starts telling me , it &apos;s such a rich system , that fish are eating what they would eat in their natural <unk> .
the biomass of plants , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , is what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s fully self @-@ renewable .
there &apos;s no food .
have you heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
later that day , i was driving with michelangelo around a property , and i asked her , &quot; i said , &quot; to a place that looks so natural , &quot; different to any <unk> that i &apos;d visited , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that time , it was as if a movie director would order to change the stage .
and by bending in the corner , we saw the most incredible landscape , thousands and thousands of pink <unk> , literally a rose to the horizon .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at his <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re doing a <unk> . &quot;
okay ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , they &apos;re not doing a <unk> with your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs to the birds . <unk>
well , last year , this property had 600,000 more than 250 different species .
it became the largest , and one of the most important <unk> of birds across europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; michelangelo , a population of thriving birds is not the last thing you &apos;d like to have in your fish <unk> ? &quot;
he moved his head , &quot; no . &quot;
he said , &quot; we grew up in a hurry , not intensive .
this is an ecological network .
shrimp are eaten by shrimp .
shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the more pink you have the belly , the better the system . &quot;
well , congratulations . a <unk> that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , and a <unk> that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a fish <unk> , but also a bird sanctuary .
oh , and by the way , those <unk> , first of all , shouldn &apos;t be there .
<unk> in a village that remains to 1,500 miles in which the ground conditions are better at making nests .
every morning , they fly 150 miles up to <unk> .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they get the white <unk> line on the highway .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i was imagining a kind of penguin march , so i looked at michelangelo .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , fly 150 miles up to <unk> , and then they fly 150 miles back to night ?
do you make that for your pups ? &quot;
he looked at me as if he had just quoted a song from houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t even like the fish skin . i don &apos;t like to shave . i don &apos;t like to shave .
that &apos;s <unk> taste , like tar .
i almost never use it for cooking .
however , when i tried it in that restaurant in southern spain , i had nothing taste for fish skin .
i had a sweet , clean taste , as if you &apos;re eating a <unk> of the ocean .
i mentioned that to michelangelo and <unk> with his head .
he said , &quot; the skin <unk> like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something between the body .
it evolved to absorb <unk> . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water does not have any <unk> . &quot;
ok . a fish that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a <unk> that measures their success for the success of their predators .
and then i realized when he says , a <unk> that has no <unk> , made a huge understatement , because the water flowing through that <unk> comes from the <unk> river .
it &apos;s a river that <unk> all the things that rivers tend to drag today , chemical pollutants , pesticide <unk> .
and when they &apos;re entering the system and they go , the water is cleaner than when they entered .
the system is so healthy that it <unk> the water .
so , not only a <unk> that does not feed your animals , not just a <unk> that measures your success for your predators , but a <unk> that is literally a water <unk> plant , and not only for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should also take it , because this love story , although romantic , is also educational .
you might say it &apos;s a prescription for the future of food , whether we &apos;re talking about <unk> or beef .
what we need now is a radically different conception of agriculture , in which food is actually tasty .
but for a lot of people , that &apos;s too radical .
we &apos;re not realistic with us ; we &apos;re lovers .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love small family farms . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and when it suggests that these are the things that <unk> the future of good food , someone next to them and says , &quot; hey , <unk> , i love pink <unk> , but you &apos;re going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , it &apos;s not because we &apos;re producing calories out there to feed the world .
one billion people will be starving today .
one billion is more than ever before in history -- because of big inequities in the distribution , not <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it has determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feeding grain to the herbivores , pesticides to crop , chemicals on the ground , chicken for the fish , and all the way down , the <unk> has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people in a more cheaply , how terrible it can be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motivation . it &apos;s been the <unk> . it &apos;s been the business plan for american agriculture .
we should call it what it really is , a business in <unk> , a business which is rapidly <unk> the ecological capital that makes its own production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our bread basket is now being threatened today , not by a supply of supplies , but by a decrease in resources .
not for the last invention of tractors , but for the fertile soil , not for bombs , but for fresh water , not for <unk> , but by forest , not for ships and fishing nets , but by fish in the sea .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better . how can we create conditions that allow every community to feed itself ?
to do this , don &apos;t look at the <unk> model for the future .
it &apos;s really old and exhausted .
it &apos;s <unk> in capital , chemistry and machinery , and it &apos;s never really rich to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s the two billion years of actual work experience .
look at michelangelo , farmers like michelangelo .
they &apos;re saying that they &apos;re not a world that is locked away from themselves , that they will involve , rather than just a surplus , farmers who are not just producers , but expertise in relationships .
because they are the ones that are also the experts who are taste experts .
and i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re better chef than i &apos;ll never be .
you know , i don &apos;t have a problem with that , because if that &apos;s the future of food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i can leave you this day with a very big idea , is that the data cluster we consume is bigger than the sum of the parts , and instead of looking at it as an information overload , what i want you to think about is how we can use that information to actually draw patterns and see trends in a different way .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sheet of mortality organized by age .
this tool i use is a small experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and with <unk> what i can do is filter a particular cause of deaths , say accidents .
and immediately we see a different pattern .
this is because , in the central section here , people are their most active stage , and here they are in the most fragile .
we can go back and look at the data because of death , looking at disease and cancer are the usual suspects , although not for everyone .
if we take age , say age 40 , we see that accidents are really the main cause of people to worry .
and if you get more involved in that , it &apos;s more common in the case of men .
so , they understand the idea that seeing information and data in this way , is like swimming through a living information <unk> .
and if we can do this with raw data , why don &apos;t we also do this for content ?
so what we have here , is the cover of all the <unk> that have been produced .
all over here . on the web .
they can go back to their rooms and try this after my talk .
<unk> can reduce it to a decade .
or reduce it to a particular year .
or you can leap straight into a particular issue .
so i &apos;m looking at this , i see athletes that have come up with this issue , sports .
i &apos;m a fan of lance armstrong , so i &apos;m going to click on that , which reveals me , all the <unk> in which this is lance <unk> .
now if you just want to take a look at this , you might think , &quot; what if we look at all the stuff that &apos;s related to cycling ? &quot;
so i can go back , and i can scale that up .
and now i see greg <unk> .
so , you have an idea that when you cross the information like this , <unk> , expanding , <unk> , you &apos;re not looking , you &apos;re not browsing .
they &apos;re doing something slightly different .
it &apos;s an in @-@ between , and we think that it changes the way we tap into information .
so i want to convey a little bit of this idea , which is a bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve taken all the pages of wikipedia , and we &apos;ve brought them down to a little summary .
the summary is a little <unk> , and an icon that indicates the area of <unk> that comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the 500 more popular pages of wikipedia .
but even in this limited view , we can do many things .
immediately , we can have a sense of the most popular wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to encourage you to select government .
now , having selected government , i can see that the wikipedia categories which most frequently correspond to that are the magazine of the year .
this is really important because this reveals something that was not content on any wikipedia page .
you can only take that look when you step back and see it all .
so , looking at one of these particular gallery , i can then drill down into the concept of time <unk> magazine , and look at them all .
so , looking at these people , i can see that most of them come from government . some of them come from natural sciences . a few , come from the world of businesses . there &apos;s my boss , and one of them comes from music .
and more interest , bono is also a winner of the ted prize .
so we can jump in and take a look at all the ted prize winners .
as you can see , we &apos;re browsing the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a network , not a page , but at a much larger level of abstraction .
i want to show you one more thing i can probably tell you a little bit .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times <unk> here .
and lo and behold , this tool -- i don &apos;t like a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see pages with it -- and we bring the information technology close to every page like this .
i can go back , give a <unk> back to a specific section .
now , the reason why it &apos;s important is because , by the simple fact that i can see pages like this , i can see my full shipping record <unk> in the same way .
and i can go into what i &apos;ve done in specific periods of time .
here , in fact , the state of all the demonstration that i just gave .
and i can do a reproduction of some of the things i saw this morning .
and , if i want to go back and see everything , i can go back and cut my history , maybe for the search history . here , i was doing a little bit of <unk> search , looking for <unk> , over here in the live <unk> .
and from here i can go to the website and make it again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that has a new purpose every time , and in every case it makes the sum bigger than the sum of its parts with the data .
so now , in this world , we think of data as a curse .
we talk about the information overload curse .
we talk about <unk> in data .
what if we turn this around and put our heads on the web , so that instead of going from one thing to the next , we get ourselves into the habit of being able to go from a lot of things , and then being able to see patterns that would otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do that , then rather than being trapped in data , we can actually extract information .
and if , instead of just dealing with information , we can gather knowledge .
and if we have knowledge , then maybe we can find wisdom .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up with a science @-@ fiction diet .
in the institute , a bus to school of an hour &apos;s journey every day .
and i was always involved in a book , a science fiction book , which <unk> my mind to other worlds , and <unk> , in a narrative , the insatiable sense that i had .
and you know , curiosity also serves itself in the sense that , as long as it wasn &apos;t in school , it was in the forest , doing <unk> and taking &quot; samples , frogs , bugs and ponds , and <unk> , looking through the microscope .
you know , i was a real science fan .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , to understand the limits of possibility .
and my love for science fiction was reflected in the world around me , all around me , at the end of the &apos; 60s , <unk> the moon , <unk> the deep oceans .
jacques cousteau came out with his incredible special room where he taught us animals and places and a wonderful world we could never have imagined before .
so , that sounded like part of science fiction .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i found that , because there were no video games or this saturation of films made by computer and all this media landscape , i had to create images in my head .
we all make them , as kids who have to read a book , through the description of the author , we put something on the movie screens of our heads .
so , my answer to this was painting , drawing aliens and their worlds , robots , space ships , all of that .
i was infinitely present in the mathematics class behind the notebook .
that was the creativity that had to come somehow .
and something interesting happened , jacques <unk> &apos;s show actually <unk> me about that there was a <unk> world right here on earth .
i could probably not go to an alien world on a spaceship some day . that seemed quite unlikely .
but that was a world that could actually go , right here on earth , which was so alive and as exotic as anything that could have imagined one of those books .
so , i decided that i was going to become a diver at 15 years .
although the only problem about that was that he lived in a canadian <unk> , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let that leave me behind .
i gave her the can to my father until he finally discovered a kind of diving in buffalo , new york , just crossing the border next to which we lived .
so , i <unk> myself in a swimming pool in a <unk> in the middle of winter in buffalo , new york .
and i didn &apos;t come to see an ocean , a real ocean , for two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the last 40 years , i &apos;ve been about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 of them in submersibles .
and i have learned that that habitat from the deep ocean and even the least deep ocean , are so rich from an amazing life that really exceeds imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so <unk> compared to our weak human imagination .
still today , i &apos;m still completely unaware of what i &apos;ve seen when i do these <unk> .
and my romance with the ocean continues , and just as strong as it was always .
although i chose a profession , as an adult , it was the director .
and it seemed to be the best way to reconcile those who would have to tell stories , with the willingness to create images .
and i was , as a child , constantly drawing comics and so forth .
so , making films was a way of putting images and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that we were telling were stories of science fiction : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and with &quot; the <unk> , &quot; i bring my love to be underwater and diving , making films .
combining the two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; which actually used to solve a kind of narrative problem in the movie , which was to create a type of liquid water creature , so we adopted computer animation .
and it turned out to be the first kind of surface @-@ made characters that has never been done in a movie .
and even though the movie wasn &apos;t too profitable , pretty much profits and losses , i should say that i witnessed something incredible , which was the audience , the world audience , was devastated by this apparent magic .
it &apos;s like the law of arthur clarke who says that any advanced technology can &apos;t be distinguish the magic .
they saw something magic .
so that made me really depressed .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be adapted to <unk> art . &quot;
so &quot; 2 terminator , &quot; my next movie , we took this much more <unk> .
working with <unk> , we created the liquid metal uncle in that movie . the <unk> was in case the effect would work .
and it worked . and we created magic again , and we had the same outcome of audience , although we took some money out of this .
so , drawing a line through those two points of experience , we came to , this was going to be a new world , this was a whole new world of creativity for creativity .
so , he believes a company with stan winston , my good friend stan , who is the main <unk> and designer of the moment , and we call it the digital <unk> .
and the goal of the company was that you would have a leap over the fiber <unk> processes , etc . , and you would go straight into digital production .
and we actually did , and we got a competitive advantage for a while .
even though we were left behind the mid @-@ 1990s in creating and designing characters , for what the company had been founded .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; , &quot; which avatar set out absolutely to drive the development of visual effects , facts by computer , but beyond , with human characters generated by computer , and the main characters would be all done by computer . and the world would be done by computer .
but the challenge was , and the company &apos;s challenge told me we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so i took it off , and i made this other movie about a big boat that <unk> .
you know , i went and sold it to the studio like &quot; romeo and juliet &quot; and &quot; juliet ; it &apos;s going to be an incredibly exciting movie .
aside , what i wanted to do was to immerse myself in the true <unk> of the titanic .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the study didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go into the remains of <unk> . we &apos;re going to actually record them . &quot;
we &apos;ll use it at the beginning of the movie .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing hook . &quot;
and i spoke to them to fund an expedition .
it sounds crazy . but this goes backwards to that about their imagination in creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later i was in a russian submersible two and a half miles underwater , looking at the actual titanic through a window .
not in a movie , not <unk> , really .
now , that made my mind fly .
and that took a lot of preparation , and we had to build cameras and lights and all those kinds of things .
although , that made me realize how much of this dive , these deep <unk> seemed to a space mission .
you know , it was pretty technical , and it had massive planning .
you get into the capsule , you go down through that dark , you get an environment where there &apos;s no hope for rescue if you can &apos;t go back for yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like i &apos;m living a science fiction movie .
this is great . &quot;
so , i really became fascinated by the exploration of the deep ocean .
of course , curiosity , the scientific component of it , was it . it was adventure . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , i could imagine a creature and we could create a special effect for her , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was looking through that window .
as we did in some of our <unk> expeditions , i was looking at <unk> across the <unk> of the water and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before , that actually wasn &apos;t described by science at the same time as we saw them , and we were <unk> them .
so , i was completely disillusioned by this , and i had to do more .
so , i made a curious decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to set up my job as a director of hollywood , and i &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time <unk> . &quot;
so , we started planning these expeditions .
and we ended up going to the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to fill with <unk> vehicles .
we went back to the remains of the titanic .
we had a few little robots that we had created with a fiber optic coil .
and the idea was to go in and do an internal recognition of the ship , which had not been done before .
nobody had seen the remains of the <unk> inside ; they &apos;d never had the media to do it , so we created a technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am , on the deck of the titanic , sitting in a submersible and looking at the sets that looked much like these , where i knew the gang had been playing .
and i would train a little robotic vehicle throughout the ship hall .
when i say , i drive , but my mind is in the vehicle .
like it was physically present inside the remains of the titanic .
and it was the most surreal leave that i &apos;ve never had before , because before we bent a corner , i knew what was going to be before the lights of the vehicle were doing it , because it had been <unk> by the <unk> for months when we were doing the movie .
and the <unk> was based on an accurate replica of the flat ship .
so it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
and it really made me realize the experience of television that you can have with these robots , through which your consciousness is embedded in a vehicle , in some other way of existence .
it was really deep .
and it can be almost as a glimpse of what can be going on in a few decades when we start having bodies that are ready to explore , or for some other medium in many types of human <unk> that i can imagine , like a fan of science fiction .
so , having done these expeditions , i really started to appreciate what was down there , in the <unk> of the deep ocean where we had <unk> animals are basically aliens here on earth .
they live in a habitat for habitat .
they don &apos;t survive a system based on sunlight like us .
so , you &apos;re looking at animals living around 500 degrees centigrade .
they didn &apos;t even exist .
at the same time , i was very interested in spatial science as well , again , the influence of science fiction , as a child .
and i ended up experimenting with the space community , very involved with nasa , with a position in nasa &apos;s advice , planning real space missions , going to russia , looking at the <unk> protocols for pre @-@ <unk> , and all that sort of thing , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d cameras .
and it was fascinating .
but what i ended up doing was bringing spatial scientists with us up to the depths .
and they came together so they had access , they were biologists , planetary scientists , interested in these extreme habitats , <unk> into ventilation , <unk> to see , and take samples and test instruments , and all that .
so , there we were doing documentaries , but actually we were doing science , and especially space science .
i had completely closed the bow between being a fan of science fiction , you know , as a kid , and doing all this stuff seriously .
and , you know , along the way of this journey of discovery , i have learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . although i also learned a lot about leadership .
you can think that a director has to be a leader , a captain of the ship , and all that .
i really hadn &apos;t learned about leadership until i did these expeditions .
because i had to , at a certain point , i say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why am i doing it ? what am i wearing ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money with these programs .
just financially , there &apos;s no fame about it .
people think that i &apos;m going to go somewhere between &quot; titanic &quot; and avatar &quot; and i was chewing the nail , somewhere , sitting on the beach .
i made all these films , all those documentaries for a very small audience .
no fame , no fame , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , by the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment , which is , by the emotion of discovery , and by that strange <unk> that comes when a small group of people form a very tight team .
because we would do these things with 10 @-@ 12 people working for years at a time , sometimes in the sea for two @-@ and @-@ three months at a time .
and with that <unk> , you realize that the most important thing is the respect you have and you have , when you do something you cannot explain to another .
when you go back to shore and you say , &quot; we have to do this , &quot; and the fiber , and the optical fibers , and this and the other , all the technology of that , and the difficulty , the aspects of human performance when you &apos;re working in the sea , you can &apos;t explain to people . that &apos;s what maybe policemen are .
it creates a <unk> , a <unk> of respect .
so , when i went back to my next movie , which was &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same principle of leadership in which i attached to your team , and thus make you respect .
and that really changed the dynamic .
and there i was with a little team , in unexplored terrain making &quot; avatar , &quot; building new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremendously exciting .
tremendously challenging .
and we become a family , over a period of four and a half years .
and that completely changed the way i make films .
people have <unk> over how it &apos;s changed , well , you know , we brought back to the organisms in the ocean and put them on the couch pandora .
for me , it was more a fundamental way of doing work , the process itself , which changed as a result of that .
so , what can we sum up all of this ?
what are the lessons ?
well , i think the first is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing they have .
imagination is a force that can manifest a reality .
and the respect of his team is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some advice to do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put you limits .
other people will do it for you , don &apos;t do you yourself , don &apos;t harm you , and take risks . &quot;
nasa has a phrase they love : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
and no major effort that has needed innovation has been done without running any risk .
they have to be willing to run risks .
and that &apos;s the thought that i would like to leave you with , whatever you do , fail is a choice , but fear is not . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a little bit amazing , because my full @-@ time work in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and improve the lives of the two billion poorest .
but , energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than anything else on the planet .
climate change means that for many years their crops won &apos;t grow . there will be too much rain , rain , and things will change so that their fragile environment can &apos;t just keep .
and that leads to hunger . it leads to <unk> riots .
climate change will be terrible for them .
also the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could choose one single thing to which you would value the price to reduce poverty , you would certainly increase energy .
the price of energy has come down over time .
indeed , the advanced civilization is based on energy advances .
the coal @-@ powered industrial revolution , and even in the years 1900 , we saw fast decrease in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have <unk> , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a fantastic situation with electricity in the developed world .
but as we make it more inexpensively -- and let &apos;s try to make it twice as much cheaper -- we have to fulfill a new constraint , and that restriction has to do with co2 .
co2 is heating the planet , and the equation of co2 is actually very simple .
if you add the co2 that &apos;s being issued , that gives rise to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase gives rise to some very negative effects , the effects on climate and perhaps even worse , the cumulative effects , because natural ecosystems cannot adjust to these rapid changes , and then the ecosystems overlap .
the exact <unk> of how to map from a certain co2 increase , until temperature we have and the exact behavior of variables , there &apos;s some uncertainty there , but not too much .
and there &apos;s probably uncertainty about what bad those effects will be , but they &apos;ll be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the leading scientists about this a few times , do we really have to go down to almost zero emissions ?
can &apos;t we just cut half or a quarter ?
and the answer is , until we can &apos;t get near zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we &apos;re a four @-@ foot tall truck trying to get under a 10 @-@ foot tall bridge , and we can sort of pass it on a little bit just a little bit to go by .
this is something that has to get to zero .
we make a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 3.2 billion tons .
about 20 tons per american . and less than a ton per one in poor countries .
it gives an average of about five tons per person on the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes to take that number to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly increasing .
it &apos;s just because of some economic changes that have come to <unk> , so we have to go from rapidly to <unk> , and we &apos;re going all the way down to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplying . so you have one thing on the left , co2 you want it to be zero , and it will be based on the number of people , the services each person uses on average , energy for every service , and the co2 that is emitted by every unit of energy .
so , let &apos;s look at each and see how we can go down to zero .
probably some of these numbers will have to get very close to zero .
now , back to high school algebra , but i &apos;m going to do a <unk> .
first , we have the population .
the world has now <unk> million people .
and it &apos;s on the way to get 13 billion .
now , if we do a big job in new vaccines , health care , and reproductive health services , we might be able to reduce that number , maybe 10 or 15 percent , but there we see a rough increase in the ground up of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this includes everything , the food we eat , coat , television , heating .
these are very good things , and eliminating poverty means giving these services to almost everybody on the planet .
and it &apos;s a big thing that this number is going up .
in the rich world , maybe the billion plus <unk> , we could reduce and use less , but every year , this figure , on average , goes up and then , in general terms , is going to double the services per person .
here &apos;s a very basic service . do you have light in your home so you can read your homework ?
in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they go outside and read their homework under the light of street lamps .
now , the efficiency of e is the energy for every service , here , finally , we have good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various invention and new ways of making illumination , through different kinds of cars , different ways of building <unk> , there are many services in which you can significantly reduce energy consumption .
some individual services do it in 90 percent .
there are other services , just like the way to make fertilizers , or <unk> transport , in which they make them much smaller .
and so , in general here , if we &apos;re optimistic , we can perhaps get to a factor of three , maybe even a six factor .
but for these three first factors , we go from <unk> million to maybe 8,000 million tons in the best cases , and that doesn &apos;t get the goal .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be the key factor -- and this is the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to come up with every unit of energy .
and the question is , can you really make it go to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you pump natural gas , no .
almost every methods that we create electricity today , except for new renewables and nuclear , they emit co2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do on a global scale , is to create a new system .
and so , we need miracles of energy .
when i use the word miracle , i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and services are a miracle .
the people who are here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
usually , we don &apos;t have a date , where you have to have the miracle ready for some date .
usually , somehow you wait , and some of them come , and not .
this is a case where we really have to move forward at maximum speed and get a miracle in a very slow time .
i thought , how can i really capture this concept ?
is there any kind of natural illustration ? have you any demonstration that <unk> people &apos;s imagination ?
i thought , in the past year , when i brought mosquitoes , and in a sense , people will enjoy it .
i actually got the idea that , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
so , with energy , the only thing that occurred to me was this .
i decided that falling fireflies would be my contribution towards the environment , here , this year .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
i &apos;ve been told that i won &apos;t shave , actually , maybe not get out of this jar .
now , there are all sorts of <unk> solutions like that , but in order and doing not too much .
we need solutions , it can be one or several , that have an unimaginable scale and an unimaginable reliability , and , although there are many directions that people are looking for , i only see five big changes .
i quit the <unk> power , geothermal , geothermal , fusion and bio @-@ fuels .
those can come up with a contribution , and if you can get more than i hope , much better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work in every single one of these five , and we can &apos;t get into any of them because they look meaningful , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels that are burning , both burning or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there seems simple , but it &apos;s not , and this is to take all the co2 after the burning of it , create a liquid , <unk> it somewhere , and wait for it to stay there .
we have a pilot tests that accomplish this with a success between 60 and 80 percent , but reaching up to 100 percent , that will be very difficult , and agree where to store these amounts of co2 will be hard , but the most difficult thing here is the long @-@ term topic .
is it going to be safe ?
does it make sure that it &apos;s literally one billion times bigger than any other kind of waste compared to nuclear or other ?
this is a lot of volume .
so , this is complicated .
next , it would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems . the cost is high , particularly in highly <unk> countries . the security issue , feel really good that nothing can fail , that even having human operators , the fuel doesn &apos;t even use for weapons .
and then what to do with waste ?
and even if it &apos;s not too big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns about it .
people need to feel quiet about it .
so it &apos;s three very difficult problems that could be solved , and it should then work on them .
it &apos;s going to last three of the five .
these are the ones that many times people refer to as renewable sources .
and actually -- although it &apos;s very good that they don &apos;t require gas -- they have some disadvantages .
one is that energy density into these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
these are energy farms , so we &apos;re talking about lots of square kilometers , thousands of times bigger than traditional energy plants .
in addition , these are blinking sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day ; it doesn &apos;t glow every day , and in the same way , the <unk> doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
and so , if we rely on these sources , we have to have some way to get the energy for those periods where it &apos;s not available .
so here we have huge cost challenges . we have input challenges , for example , if this energy is out of our country , we not only need technology , but we have to deal with the risk of energy coming from the other side .
and finally , this storage problem .
and , in order to test it , i investigate and i looked for all the kinds of batteries that are made for cars , for cars , for phones , <unk> , for everything , and i compared that amount of electrical energy that uses the world , and what i discovered is that all the batteries that we make could now store less than 10 minutes of that energy .
so , actually , we need a big breakthrough in this regard , an improvement by a factor of a hundred or more than the advances we have right now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very easy .
this is what happens when you try to get the <unk> source to be up for 20 or 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re relying on this for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
how are we going to go ahead with this ? what &apos;s the right way of <unk> ?
is it like the manhattan project ? what &apos;s going to bring us to destination ?
well , we need a lot of companies working on this , working on it .
in each of these five ways , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , pick them up and say they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
and i think here in the ted group , we have a lot of people who are already chasing this goal .
bill <unk> has several companies , including one called <unk> , which has several very good solar technologies .
<unk> <unk> is investing in dozens of companies that are doing big things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to figure them out .
with nathan myhrvold , we &apos;re seeing a <unk> that is , perhaps , amazingly , focused on nuclear .
there are innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
and the innovation takes off in this industry quite a long time ago , so the concept that there are some good ideas going around is not surprising .
the idea behind <unk> is that instead of burning some of the uranium , one percent , which is <unk> , we decided , we &apos;re going to save 99 percent , <unk> .
it &apos;s a crazy idea .
in fact , people have talked about this for a long time , but they could never properly simulate if it would work or not , and it is through the arrival of modern supercomputers that you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material approach , it seems that it could work .
and because you &apos;re burning 99 percent , you have a profile of highly improved costs .
you &apos;re actually burning the waste , and you can use it as a fuel from all the waste that comes from today &apos;s reactors .
so , instead of worrying about them , you use them . it &apos;s a big thing .
it &apos;s consuming this uranium as it advances . it &apos;s like a candle .
as you can see there , it &apos;s a log , it <unk> a lot like a radiation wave reactor .
at the gas level , this actually solves the problem .
i have a picture here from a place in kentucky state .
this is the waste . 99 percent , of which already took out the part that &apos;s burning now , so it &apos;s called uranium <unk> .
that <unk> from electricity to the united states for hundreds of years .
and they would simply <unk> seawater through a low @-@ cost process , have enough gas for the entire rest of the planet .
so , as you know , it has a lot of challenges ahead , but it &apos;s an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to go ahead .
so , let &apos;s think , how should we define ourselves ?
what should our school address look like ?
well , let &apos;s look where we really have to get , and then look at the intermediate point .
by 2050 , you heard a lot of people talking about this 80 percent reduction .
it &apos;s really important that we get to that point .
and that 20 percent will be used by needs in poor countries like agriculture ; we wish we have cleaned and cement .
so , in order to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to change their generation completely .
so , the other note is : are we getting this zero @-@ emission technology ? have we <unk> it in all developed countries ? and are we in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
that &apos;s very important .
it &apos;s a key element to pass that school newsletter .
so , going back from there , how should you see the cartoon of the year 2020 ?
well , again , it should have two elements .
we should be able to implement these efficiency measures to begin to dramatically reduce . the less <unk> , the less the sum of co2 , and therefore , the less the temperature will be .
but , in some ways , the note that we get there , doing things that don &apos;t take us all the way to the big <unk> , is just the same , or maybe even a little less important than the other , which is the piece of innovation of these big breakthroughs .
these advances , we need to move at maximum speed , and we can measure that at the level of companies , race projects , and require that they have changed .
there are many good books that have been written about this .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; our <unk> &quot; and the book by david <unk> , &quot; sustainable energy , not hot air . &quot;
they really study it and create a framework for this to be widely discuss , because we need a broad support for this .
there &apos;s a lot to keep .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish for this technology .
if you give me just a wish for the next 50 years , you could choose who &apos;s president , you could choose a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could choose that this thing that has half the cost and zero co2 emissions is invented this wish to me .
this is the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t have this wish , the divide between the people who think in the short term and in the long term will be terrifying , between the u.s. and china , among the poor and rich countries , and most of those 2,000 billion lives will be much worse .
so , what should we do ?
what am i focusing on you to take a step forward and drive ?
we need to look more funding for research .
when countries come together in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just argue about co2 .
they should discuss on this innovation agenda , and they would be amazed at these levels of ridiculously low overhead , these innovative approaches .
we need market incentives , co2 tax over co2 , carbon bonds , something that <unk> that price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need this <unk> to be more rational , that it &apos;s a more <unk> , including the steps that government takes .
this is an important wish , but it &apos;s a wish that i think we can reach .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand more about <unk> , right -- i mean , first of all : can you give us a sense of what the scale of investment would be ?
bill gates : to make the software out of super @-@ computer , to employ all of the big scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials on a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , there would only be only 10 million .
the hard thing is to build the pilot , get the various billions , find the regulator , where the location of what would be going to build the first of these .
once you have the first built , and if it works like <unk> , then it &apos;s clear like the day , because economic variables and energy density are as different from nuclear as we know it .
now , is this really important to build deep on the ground , almost like a vertical nuclear fuel column , of these kinds of uranium already used , and then the process starts from above and then goes down ?
<unk> : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always getting gas from the reactor , so you have lots and lots of controls that you can have a mistake that you have to open and move things in and out . that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap gas from which one you can carry for about 60 years -- just think of it as a trunk -- and not have those same complications .
and it only stays there and it burns for the &apos; 60s , and then it &apos;s there .
it &apos;s a nuclear plant that includes its own solution of disposal .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens with the garbage , you can leave it there -- there &apos;s much less waste with this approach -- then you can actually grab that one , and put it in another and burn that one .
and we started taking the waste that exists at the moment of today , which is in these cooling <unk> or <unk> <unk> , which is our fuel to break .
so , what was a problem for those reactors is what we feed our ours , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of waste in a fairly <unk> way by going the way .
but when you talk to different people around the world , about these possibilities .
where is there more interest to actually do something with this ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t chosen a particular place , and there are all these rules of about anything called nuclear , so we &apos;re very interested in the company that &apos;s been in russia , india and china . i &apos;ve been here with the secretary of energy , talking about how this might fit into the energy agenda .
so i &apos;m optimistic . french and japanese have done some work .
this is a variation on something that had been previously done .
it &apos;s a major breakthrough , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anyone who has done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first is .
so , in your head , scale of times and probability of putting something online ?
<unk> : well , we need first one of these things that &apos;s very large @-@ generation projection that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to implement .
that &apos;s roughly the term that we have to fulfill the environmental model .
and , you know , let &apos;s face it , if things work well , that it &apos;s very wish , it could easily be distracted .
and there are now , fortunately , dozens of companies , but we need them to be hundreds , which at once , if their science works well , if the funding for their pilots working well , that they can compete for this .
and it &apos;s better if several of them are successful , because you could use a mix .
we need a successful .
in terms of large @-@ scale play changes , this is the biggest thing you know is ?
<unk> : a revolutionary progress in energy is the most important .
it would have been , even without environmental constraint , but environmental restriction makes it much more important .
in the nuclear world , there are other innovators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their jobs as well as we know this , but the modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a reactor of the liquid that looks a little bit difficult , but maybe tell the same thing about us .
and so , there are several different , but the beauty in this is that uranium atom has millions of times more energy than for example , a carbon atom and then , if you can deal with the negative dots , which are essentially radiation , footprint and cost , in terms of effect on the ground and various things , it &apos;s almost in a category .
what if this doesn &apos;t work , then ?
should we start taking action measure that we should try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
<unk> : if you go into that situation , it &apos;s like you would have a fan of more , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack . and what do you do ? you probably need heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research line about something called geo @-@ engineering , which are a number of techniques that <unk> warming to give us maybe 20 or 30 years away , until we agree .
now , that &apos;s just a insurance <unk> .
you don &apos;t expect to have to do that .
some people say that you shouldn &apos;t work on the insurance <unk> because you can make yourself safe and consume them because you know that heart surgery can save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the option given to the importance of the problem , but there is now the argument about geo @-@ engineering , if we should have a list in our sleeve in case things would happen faster , or that innovation will be much slower than it was expected .
climate skeptical : if you had a sentence or two to tell you , like the <unk> that are wrong ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , skeptical come from different sides .
those who make scientific arguments are very few .
are you saying that there are negative feedback effects that you have to do with clouds that offset things ?
there are very , very few things that you can even say there &apos;s a possibility in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here is something like aids .
you increase the error now , and you pay the price much later .
and so , when you have all kinds of urgent problems , the idea of suffering now that it has to do with a profit later -- and a meaningful suffering -- in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst stage , and there are people in the developed world looking at the ipcc and say , well , this is not a big deal .
the fact is , it &apos;s that uncertain part , which should be moving towards this .
but my dream here is that if you can do it in an economic way , and fulfilling the constraints of co2 , then i &apos;m going to say , well , i don &apos;t care that i &apos;m not going to give co2 , i wish i &apos;d co2 , but i think i accept it because it &apos;s cheaper .
and so , that would be your answer to the <unk> argument , which basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take your attention from your other goals to try to release the world of poverty , and malaria , and so on , to invest money in that is a waste of the resources of the soil when there &apos;s better things that we can do .
<unk> : well , real spending on the part of me &amp; amp ; d -- says the united states should spend 10,000 million more than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t take other things .
the moment you go into big numbers , and in this reasonable crowd , you can disagree with , that &apos;s when you have something that &apos;s not economic and you &apos;re trying to cure them . that , to me , is a big deal , a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re funding the learning curve , and it &apos;s going to be very cheap . i think we should try more things that have a potential to be much less expensive .
if the exchange you come in is , let &apos;s make the super expensive energy , then the rich can buy it .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times more for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disaster is for those two billion .
and even <unk> has changed .
his <unk> is now , because he &apos;s not discussing the most i and d ?
he &apos;s still , for his earlier arguments , associated with the side of the skeptical , but he &apos;s realized he &apos;s on a pretty lonely side , and then he &apos;s <unk> the argument of the i r &amp; amp ; d.
and then there &apos;s a string of something that i think is appropriate .
the part of me &amp; amp ; d , it &apos;s amazing how little it &apos;s being funded .
well bill , i suspect i speak in the name of most people here saying , i really hope your wish will be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> introduced the <unk> of design called the marshmallow challenge .
and the idea is pretty simple : four people &apos;s teams have to build an autonomous structure with 20 <unk> of <unk> , a string <unk> , a rope <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to go up .
and , although it sounds easy , it &apos;s quite difficult , because it force people to collaborate very fast .
and so , i thought it was an interesting idea , and we put it in a design shop .
and it was a great success .
and since then , i &apos;ve done some 70 design workshops around the world with students , designers and architects , all the way to the <unk> of major companies , and there &apos;s something that reveals deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
most people start working with the task .
the members argue and calculate what the structure will look like , by the power .
then you &apos;re planning , organizing . you draw it and you get spaghetti .
they spend most of their time riding the <unk> into structures .
and then finally , right when you just take the marshmallow , and you get a grain of salt over it , and then you move away , and &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
but actually , what &apos;s often going on is that the &quot; ah @-@ ha &quot; becomes &quot; oh @-@ no @-@ &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow makes the whole structure collapse .
so there are several people who have more moments , &quot; oh , &quot; than others , and the worse are the graduates in business school .
lie , they cheat , they absorb <unk> , and they produce <unk> structures .
and , of course , there are teams that have many more structures , &quot; ah , &quot; and , amongst the best ones , there are the graduates of kindergarten .
and this is quite incredible .
peter tells us , they don &apos;t only get the tallest structures , but they &apos;re also the most interesting of all .
so , what you want to ask is : how ? why ? what do you have ?
peter likes to say , &quot; no children try to be the ceo of spaghetti sauce . &quot; right .
they don &apos;t spend time fighting for power .
but there &apos;s also another reason .
and that is that business students are trained to find the only right plan , ok .
and then they don &apos;t .
and what happens , when you put the marshmallow over , they stay out of time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
does it sound something ? ok .
what kids do differently is , they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , prototyping <unk> , always keeping the marshmallow over , so they have a lot of opportunities for failed prototypes in the process .
designers consider these kinds of collaboration like the essence of the <unk> process .
and with every version , kids are taking snapshot observations about what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so , the ability to play with prototypes is essential , but look at how they deliver different teams .
the average for most people is about half feet , business students , get half of that , lawyers , a little bit better , but not much more , kids , better than most adults .
who gets better than anyone ?
architects and engineers , thank god !
the tallest structure i &apos;ve seen is one meter .
why is it ? because they understand that the triangles and patterns that self @-@ sustain are the key in building stable structures .
the ceos , a little bit better than the average , but this is where it gets interesting .
if you put a management executive in the team , ceos improve quite a lot .
it &apos;s amazing . take a look and you say , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can see them beforehand . and why ?
because they have special skills of self @-@ similarity .
they drive the process , they understand it .
and any teams that manage , and they do well in work , they will really enhance the performance of their team .
specialized skills and <unk> skills , and the combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that usually work together , we &apos;ll work with about six stable structures .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , i &apos;ll play the bet .
i decided to give 10,000 dollars in software to the winning team .
and what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . none of the teams had a stable structure .
if someone would have built , say , an inch structure , they could have taken the prize for home .
isn &apos;t it interesting that high risk has a strong impact ?
we did the same test with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
under these conditions , they understood the value of prototypes .
and the same team step from being the worst to being amongst the best .
they get the tallest structures in the short time .
there are important lessons here about the phenomenon of incentives and success .
you were saying , &quot; why would someone spend time designing a <unk> challenge ? &quot;
and the reason is that i will help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the challenge of the marshmallow does is to help you identify the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , all the projects have their marshmallow , right ?
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of the experience , of this simple exercise .
and those of you , you probably want to visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build <unk> .
there &apos;s instructions on this .
there are crazy examples that come from around the world of how people change and follow the system .
there are world records as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i think , is that design is a contact sport .
it demands that we have all our senses on the task , and that we apply our best ideas , our sentiments and acts on the <unk> that we care about .
and sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is all we need to take us out of a &quot; oh @-@ no @-@ &quot; moment &quot; at a moment ... &quot; da @-@ da . &quot;
and that can create a huge difference .
thank you very much .
don &apos;t realize we have a machine right here .
a big machine , a super @-@ ted machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and that everyone in this room has to get in .
and you can go backwards ; you can go ahead ; you can &apos;t stay where you are .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i was asking my friends this question quite recently , and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before they had <unk> or twitter , or &quot; american idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of <unk> towards <unk> , towards magic thinking .
and i get that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because the possibilities on this planet are not going backwards ; they &apos;re going forward .
so i want to get into the machine , and i want to go ahead .
this is the best time i &apos;ve ever had on this planet under any criteria you want to use : health , mobility , opportunity , disease rates going down .
there has never been a while like this .
my <unk> died , all of them for when they arrived at 60 .
my grandparents will cut that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in 80 .
so it &apos;s better than there &apos;s a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is much bigger than that .
a child born in new delhi today can wait to live as much as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about that . it &apos;s an amazing fact .
and why is this true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed millions of people on this planet .
it &apos;s called the balloon demographics in a way where no war has done it .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s disappeared .
the <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases that benefit millions of us just one generation of us , there is no more , almost .
<unk> , <unk> , polio ...
someone even knows they &apos;re these things ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are wins from the scientific method .
and in my mind , the scientific method , to try things , to see if it works , when it doesn &apos;t work , is one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the only good news because there are other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is , despite all of our achievements , a billion people go to hunger bed in this world , every day .
that number is growing , and very fast , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to <unk> this world .
clean water , <unk> soil , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re running out , and they &apos;re running out soon , and unless we start off in a solution to this disaster , we &apos;re <unk> ourselves .
so , the question is : we can do it ? i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that <unk> billions of people without <unk> the land that we live in .
i think we can feed this world with energy that we can &apos;t do it at once .
i really believe this , and , no , it &apos;s not magic .
but there &apos;s one thing that doesn &apos;t allow me to sleep -- one of the things that keeps me awake . we &apos;ve never needed the progress of science more than now .
and we &apos;ve never been in a position to think properly , as we can .
we &apos;re at the edge of amazing events in many different fields , and yet , i certainly believe that we should go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we &apos;re going to cross progress , where we &apos;re going to link to these things that we &apos;re more hopeful about , what we &apos;re doing now .
people get into their beliefs , and they do it so <unk> that you can &apos;t release them .
it won &apos;t even be free .
and listen , everybody has a right to have their opinion ; they have a right to have their opinion about progress .
but you know what you have no right ?
you have no right to have your own facts . sorry , but you don &apos;t .
and realizing this took me a while .
a decade ago , i wrote a story about vaccines for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a short story .
and i &apos;m just surprised to find opposition , opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and i went ahead .
and soon after that , i wrote an article on genetically modified foods .
he did the same thing , only worse .
people applaud .
so , i took a paper about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenstein , &quot; why we found that moving the <unk> back in a specific way , more than neglected , it was invade nature &apos;s terrain .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article and i went ahead .
i mean , i &apos;m just a journalist .
<unk> , <unk> , we &apos;re going to dinner , okay .
but these stories provided me , and i couldn &apos;t understand why , and i finally understood .
and that happened because the <unk> who were getting me crazy were not really fans .
i was thinking , people who were polite , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and that worried me so much .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress that we used to have .
we talk about him <unk> .
we talk about him in terms of <unk> , quote : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we have lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why we haven &apos;t done it .
you can just say a few names , and people will pray .
<unk> , <unk> , the challenger , <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , <unk> electoral <unk> .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe that they were always right , so be skeptical .
ask , do we test , test evidence .
don &apos;t give them any for granted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get evidence , you have to accept evidence , and we &apos;re not good at doing that .
and the reason i can say this is because we &apos;re now in a fear epidemic like i &apos;ve never seen before , and i hope i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a <unk> came out , a horrible story , that <unk> the autism epidemic to receive the vaccine against measles , <unk> and <unk> .
very scary .
lots of studies were done to see if this was true .
lots of studies had to be done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the results arrived .
the results came from the united states , england , from sweden , from canada , and everything was the same , no correlation , no connection , nothing .
that doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe in what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe a lot of documents from a government official giving us information , and i understand that , i think we all understand .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disastrous .
disastrous for this fact : the united states is one of the few countries in the world where immunization rate is falling .
this is unfortunate , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it &apos;s nasty .
what kind of thing happened so we could do that .
now , i get it . i certainly get it .
because here , some of you have measles ?
have you ever seen anyone die from measles ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very much .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened sometimes in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from measles . 20 an hour .
but because it didn &apos;t happen here , we can get it out of our minds , and people like jenny can predict fear and illiteracy from fear and illiteracy around from oprah and larry <unk> .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t have causality and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these two things look the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
and it &apos;s something we have to learn , and we need to learn very soon .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
the moved away from us one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no agony : polio , <unk> , no more .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul <unk> .
he only developed a <unk> vaccine with a group of people .
he saves the life of 400,000 children per year , in the <unk> world .
pretty good , no ?
well , it &apos;s okay , except , because paul is out there talking about vaccines , and he says how valuable they are and people should just stop them .
and really , he says that .
so , paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks in a public audience , he can &apos;t deal with armed guards .
he gets calls in his house , because people like to tell him that they remember where their kids go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
and i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you get them out , and disease comes back , awful diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and very soon kids are going to die of that again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
and they &apos;re not going to die only from measles .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a school companion wrote me a few weeks ago , and he said he thought i was a little stubborn .
never before had someone said that .
she was not going to get her child to polio . no way .
okay .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy took a plane in lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to los angeles , right now he &apos;s on ohio .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet we live on . let &apos;s not make it like we don &apos;t .
now , we love <unk> . we love doing it .
everybody got their vitamins this morning ?
<unk> , a little girl to stay young .
i know they did it because half americans do it every day .
they take those things , and they take choices , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they don &apos;t serve at all .
the data tells you all the time .
your urine . they almost never do more than that .
okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m totally with you .
urine , dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand , we hate the great drug .
we hate big governments . we don &apos;t hate them in the guy .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system sucks .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolute and amazingly cold , and even for those that we can pay for .
so let &apos;s move away from him , and where are we running ?
we jump to the arms of the great gatsby .
it &apos;s fantastic . i love the great gatsby .
but , you know , it &apos;s a really serious thing because these things are garbage , and we spend billions of dollars on them .
and i have all kinds of little supplements here .
none of them -- <unk> , fraud , fraud , fraud , fraud , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know it &apos;s but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on this ; it &apos;s a fraud .
and you know what ? when i say this , people scream at me , and they say , &quot; what do you mind ? let people do whatever you want .
he makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i &apos;m not going to be disappointed if i &apos;m the minister of health who says , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m not going to do any case of the evidence of my experts in <unk> , &quot; or some sort of oncologist who want to treat your patient with coffee <unk> .
when you start the <unk> where you believe and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in south africa .
he killed 400,000 of his people to insist that the <unk> and lemon oil were much more effective than anti @-@ retroviral drugs that we know can reduce aids progress .
hundreds of thousands of <unk> deaths in a country that has been <unk> more than any one for this disease .
please don &apos;t tell me there &apos;s no consequences of these things .
there are . there are always .
now , the most insane epidemic in which we &apos;re engaged right now is this crazy battle between genetically modified foods and organic elite .
it &apos;s a controversial debate . it has to end .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metaphors .
ideology is not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every <unk> of <unk> , every <unk> of brussels , has been modified by the man .
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden of eden .
there was no <unk> .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some things worked and some didn &apos;t .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can do it much more precisely , and there are risks , absolutely . but we can put a little bit of vitamin a in rice , and that can help millions of people , millions of people , to prolong their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t get it .
we distract genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things that i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , crop , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want life @-@ changing companies .
we don &apos;t want seed companies .
and you know what my answer is to that ?
yes , they &apos;re right . they &apos;re <unk> .
it &apos;s true , we have a very big food problem , but this is not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s the law ; it &apos;s the moral ; it &apos;s the issue of patents .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea . it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do its work because we &apos;re afraid , it &apos;s really fatal , and this preventing millions of people can thrive .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to produce 70 percent more food than today , 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
they need it , and we &apos;re not going to hate it .
and why ? genetically modified foods .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat those bad things , like &quot; <unk> &quot; for example .
<unk> is something that 500 million people eat .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a lot of calories . it sucks .
and it has no nutrients , it has no proteins , and scientists are actually modifying all this in it right now .
and then people could eat it and they could avoid being blind .
you don &apos;t die of hunger , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be &quot; <unk> , &quot; but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is , why are we exhausted ?
i mean , hey , why are we exhausted ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes back .
it &apos;s about moving genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> to have bigger food , better food , unique food .
this is not about &quot; rice burroughs , &quot; this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s time that we start to understand what that means .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we continue acting like now , we &apos;re guilty of something that i don &apos;t think we should be guilty of being guilty , &quot; high @-@ tech anxious . &quot;
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beyond us , and we really have to fix it .
so , after this funny funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to go into this ridiculous machine of time and go ahead ? &quot;
absolutely . i want .
it &apos;s <unk> in the present now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can program that time machine in what we want .
we can move where we want , and we &apos;re going to move where we want to move .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but when we get into the machine and go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy to do it .
i know we can , and , as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the effect of <unk> , which might seem a strange thing to what a magician could be interested in , not be aware that you think in the way that i do , which is , &quot; if somebody believes something fake enough , it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in some studies , placebo effect , just for one person to think that what &apos;s happening to this is a pharmaceutical thing , or something like driving pain , for example , if you believe enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect in the body called the placebo effect .
something fake turns into something real because of the perception you have .
so , for us to understand better , i want to start by showing you a simple magic trick and rudimentary .
and i will demonstrate to you how it works . this is a trick that has been in children &apos;s books for kids at least .
i learned it from the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it to you .
and then i &apos;ll tell you why i explained it .
this is what happens .
the knife , which you can examine , my hand , which you can examine .
he <unk> the knife in my coat like this .
grab my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing goes up or down , hold up my right wrist here .
so , at no point , something can move around . for the time that my wrist is holding , you can &apos;t go up or down my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and i hope , if this whole <unk> , my animal magnetism <unk> the knife .
in fact , it &apos;s sustained so hard that i can hide , and the knife does not fall .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , nothing you can look at everything .
<unk> @-@ da !
so , this is the trick that i usually teach young people who are interested in <unk> , because they can learn quite a lot about delusions studying this trick -- even when it &apos;s a simple trick .
probably a lot of you in this room know the trick .
what happens is this .
i &apos;m holding the knife with my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to hold my wrist , and make sure that nothing goes up or down my sleeve , it &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding my wrist is because that &apos;s really the secret of illusion .
at the moment that the front of my hand moves to be hidden from you , this finger , my finger will move where it is , to a position pointing like this .
very good .
someone who didn &apos;t have childhood is over there .
so , it &apos;s moving over here .
and as i move , my finger moves .
and we could talk about why it &apos;s a deception , why they didn &apos;t realize there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three . the <unk> .
but that &apos;s not really what this is all about , right ? so , i open my hand .
obviously , it &apos;s hanging there and not by animal magnetism , if not fraud , my finger lies there .
and when i close my finger , like that , when i move , this kind of movement covers my finger &apos;s <unk> .
he retirement his hand . he <unk> the knife .
this is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
i read a studio , about a year ago that really opened my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me was an amazing thing .
it turns out that if you use a placebo in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s like the shape of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round pill , it has some measurable effects .
but if you change the way you measure placebo , like doing a smaller pill , blue <unk> , and you give a letter , it &apos;s notoriously effective .
even though none of the two have a pharmaceutical effect -- these are sugar pills .
but the white pill , it &apos;s not as good as the blue pill .
what ? that really stuck me with a <unk> .
but it turns out that &apos;s not all .
if you have capsules , they &apos;re more effective than any other tablet .
a colored capsule , this is , yellow on one side and red on the other , is <unk> that a white capsule .
<unk> has something to do with this .
a pill twice a day , it &apos;s not as good as three <unk> -- i don &apos;t remember the statistics now . i &apos;m sorry .
but the point is ...
these <unk> have something to do .
and the shape also has something to do .
and if you want the last placebo , you go to the needles .
right ? a syringe had something <unk> a couple of <unk> of something very inert , and we <unk> this to the patient .
this is a very powerful picture in your mind , this is much stronger than any white pill .
it really is , this graph , i &apos;m going to show you in another moment when i have the slides .
the point is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , and this is not as good as the capsule and this is not as good as the needle .
and no one really has any pharmaceutical quality . it &apos;s just your belief that makes it real in your body and creates a strong effect .
i would like to see if you could actually take that idea , and apply it to a magic trick .
take something which is really a fake trick and make it look real .
and we know from that study , that when you want something real , you get distracted by the needles .
this is a seven @-@ inch hat hat . it &apos;s very <unk> , and i &apos;m going to play it a little bit .
this is my tissue . this is not . the special fabric of <unk> .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to penetrate my skin , and get through the needle into the other side .
if you were distracted -- if you were easily distracted -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel on the other night , and other people who didn &apos;t know , and a woman was nearly drowned .
so i would suggest to you that if you &apos;re easily distracted , look for the next few moments in fact , you know what , i &apos;m going to do this first part in hide .
you &apos;ll see it , you can look for something else if you want .
so , this is what happens , the beginning of my tissue in the bottom of my arm , i made a little <unk> .
sorry , am i wrong ?
and i rub my skin a little bit , and i take it off the other side like this .
now , we &apos;re essentially in the same position as the knife trick .
somehow .
but right now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so let me go . one , two , three , four , five .
yes , good ...
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; well , he &apos;s not as dumb as to cut the skin just like this for a few minutes . &quot;
so , let me show you a little bit .
how are they going ? very well .
yeah .
and people back up there will say , &quot; well , i didn &apos;t really see it . &quot;
the people in the <unk> room are starting to move .
let me show you a little bit more .
this is really my skin . this is not a <unk> effect of hollywood .
this is my meat and i can move around .
sorry , if you &apos;re squeamish -- look for another <unk> -- don &apos;t look at this .
the people out there or the people who watch the video will say , &quot; well , you see the effect , &quot; but if it were real , he would do this -- notice there &apos;s a gap here and there , if it were real , it would be <unk> .
well , let me show you a little bit of blood .
yes , there it is .
usually , now he would be taking the needle .
my arm and show them that there are no wounds .
but i think in this context , and with the idea of taking something fake , and making it something real , i &apos;ll leave it like this , and get out of the stage .
i &apos;m going to be watching them a few times during the morning .
i hope you will . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
i made someone tell the number of books with the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the title , published in the last five years and gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there &apos;s an enormous amount of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of advice about happiness .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this crowd of jobs , there are a whole host of cognitive kinds that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be especially about these robust cognitive traps .
this is both about the ordinary people who think about their own <unk> as the academics who think about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re both confused like everyone else .
the first of these traps is the <unk> of its complexity .
turns out the word happiness is no longer a useful word because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we could be aware of , but in general , this is something we &apos;re going to have to throw away , and we &apos;re going to have to adopt the more complicated view of what well @-@ being is .
second trap is a confusion between experience and memory : particularly being happy with your life and be happy with your life or your life as happy .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both embedded in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the focus illusion , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think of any <unk> that affects well @-@ being without <unk> its importance .
i mean , this is a fundamental cognitive trap .
it &apos;s impossible not to be wrong .
now i would like to start with an example of someone in a question session and answers after a lecture of my lectures that told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he had been listening to a symphony and which was an absolutely wonderful , absolutely wonderful music , and at the end of the recording , there was a horrible sound .
and then he said , really affected , that had gone missing the whole experience .
but it wasn &apos;t .
what had gone missing was the memories of that experience .
he had had the experience .
i had 20 minutes of a glorious music .
and they didn &apos;t know at all because it was stuck with a memory , the memory had <unk> up , and it was all that was left .
what this tells us , actually , is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two <unk> .
there &apos;s a self that has experiences , that lives in the present and meets the present , is able to revive the past , but it basically only has the present .
it &apos;s the self that has experiences that treat a doctor when you ask , &quot; do you hurt now , when i play here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a self that remembers , and i remember is the one who takes note , and keeps the history of our life , and that is the doctor asks him , &quot; how does it feel lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something .
these are two very different entities , the self that has experiences and the self that has memories and <unk> between them is part of the problematic notion of happiness .
now , the self that has memories is a storyteller .
and that really begins as an immediate answer to our memories -- it <unk> .
we don &apos;t just tell stories , when we tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what remains to remind us of our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
this is an old study .
these are real patients being treated by painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into detail . it &apos;s not painful these days , but it was , when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to lie on their pain every 60 seconds .
and here we have two patients . this is their data .
and if you ask , &quot; who suffered more ? &quot;
it &apos;s a very easy question .
of course , the patient b suffered more . his <unk> lasted longer , and every minute of pain the patient a had the patient a b and even more .
but now we ask another question , &quot; how much do you think these patients that have suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s the surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a had a much worse memory of the <unk> than the patient b.
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ended .
and none of these stories inspires a lot or is great , but one of them is different ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse was the one where the pain had its peak at the end . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people after the <unk> , and a lot later , &quot; how painful was the experience , overall ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in the way you remember it .
so this is a direct conflict between me and experiences and the self that reminds .
from the standpoint of self that has experiences , it &apos;s clear that b had a worse experience .
now , what we could do with the patient a , and we actually do clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it really works , could extend the <unk> of the patient a , just keep the tube without moving too much .
that will make the patient suffer , but only a little , much less than before .
and if you do it for a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve made the self that has experiences from the patient a to tell you a worse situation , and that the self that reminds from the patient a &apos;s far better , because now you have <unk> the patient .
what defines a story ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory provides us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
what defines a story is changes , important moments and the end .
the end is very , very important and , in this case , <unk> the end .
now , the self that has experiences lives in a continuous way .
it has experiences , one after the other .
and i &apos;ll tell you , what about these experiences ?
and the answer is very simple . they lose forever .
i mean , most of the moments in our life -- and i &apos;ve calculated it -- <unk> , the psychological present is said that it has about three seconds of length , which means in a life there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there are close to 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any trace .
most of them are completely ignored by me .
and yet , somehow we find that they should be aware that what happens to us in these moments and experiences is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource we have while we &apos;re in this world .
and how to use it , it seems to be relevant , but that &apos;s not the story that we have for ourselves .
so we have the self that reminds and the self that has experiences , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is in their treatment of time .
from the point of view of me having experiences , if you have a vacation , and the second week is as good as the first , then these two @-@ week vacation is twice as good as comparison to a vacation of a week .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all , i remember .
for me , remember , two weeks of vacation are barely better than the vacation of a week because there &apos;s no new memories .
it hasn &apos;t changed history .
and in this way , time is really the fundamental variable that distinguishes me remind you of the self that has experiences . time has very little impact on this story .
now , the self that remembers makes more than remember and storytelling .
actually , it &apos;s the decision @-@ making , because , if you have a patient who has had , let &apos;s say , two <unk> with two different surgeons and he has to decide which of them to choose , then , engage that surgeon who has a less <unk> memory than that surgeon .
the self that has experiences has no voice or no vote in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between experiences memories .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think about our future normally in terms of experiences .
we think of our future in terms of predictable memories .
and you can essentially see it , like a tyranny of me , and you can think of me , you can think of it as <unk> to the self that has experiences to have experiences that doesn &apos;t really need .
i have a sense that when we go on holiday this is a very frequent case , i mean , we go on holiday , largely , by the service of myself , remember .
and i think this is a little hard to justify .
i mean , how much do we think about our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of the self that reminds .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we had in antarctica a few years ago , which were certainly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think about them in relative frequency , as soon as i think about other vacation .
and i probably thought about my memories of that three @-@ week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 photos on it , i would have spent another hour .
that &apos;s for three weeks , and it &apos;s about an hour and a half .
there seems to be a fault .
well , i can look a little bit extreme , in the very few people , and i have to think about my memories , but even if we spend it a little bit more time , it comes up with a big question . why do we give our memories a relationship to the importance that we give to experiences ?
so i want you to come up with an experiment about thought .
imagine that in your next holidays , you know , at the end of your vacation , your whole photos will be taken , and you &apos;ll give you a drug <unk> so you &apos;re not going to buy anything .
now , do you have the same vacation ?
and if you go to a few different holidays , there would be a conflict between your two <unk> , and you have to think about how you would lose that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not that obvious , because , if you translate it into terms of time , then you have an answer . and if you put it in terms of memories , you &apos;ll get another answer .
why do we choose the vacation we chose ? it &apos;s a problem that takes us back to a choice between the two <unk> .
now , the two <unk> perform two notions of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can benefit from , one for each of us .
so you can ask : how happy is the self that has experiences ?
and then you get excited : how are you happy in the life of the self that has experiences ?
and everyone is -- happiness at every time is a pretty complicated process .
what emotions can be measured ?
and , by the way , we are now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the self that has experiences over time .
if you ask for the happiness of me , it &apos;s a totally different thing .
it &apos;s not about how you &apos;re happy a person .
it &apos;s about how he <unk> a person when he thinks about his life .
a very different notion .
any person who doesn &apos;t distinguish these concepts , is going to confuse you in the study of happiness , and i belong to a group of studies of well @-@ being , who have been confused into the study of happiness for a long time because of it .
the distinction between the happiness of me that has experiences and the satisfaction of the self that remember has been recognized in the last few years , and is currently trying to measure both .
the gallup organization does a world poll with over half a million people who have been asked about what they think about their life and their experiences . and there have been other <unk> in that sense .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started to learn about the happiness of the two <unk> .
and the main lesson that i think we have learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with your life , and that doesn &apos;t really tell you a lot about whether they &apos;re living their lives in a happy way , and vice versa .
to give an idea of correlation , correlation is 0.5 .
which means that if you met someone , and they said , oh his father is six feet tall , how much do you know about his height ?
well , you know something about your height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
you have a lot of uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone is going to spend their life on a scale of 10 , there &apos;s still a whole lot of uncertainty about how happy it is with respect to their self that has experiences .
so , the correlation is low .
we know something about what controls the fulfillment of self &apos;s happiness .
we know that money is very important , our goals are very important .
we know that happiness is fundamentally being satisfied with the people we like to be , spend time with the people we like .
there are other pleasures , but this is the dominant one .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two <unk> , doing very different things .
the conclusion of what i said here is that you really shouldn &apos;t think of happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being .
it &apos;s a whole different concept .
now , very quickly , another reason why we can &apos;t really think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we really live .
so , if you ask simply how happy the people of california are , you &apos;re not going to get a correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people should be happier in california , what if you live in ohio , for example .
and what happens is , when you think about life in california , you &apos;re thinking about the contrast between california and elsewhere , and that contrast is , for example , climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for me who have experiences , and it &apos;s not even very important for me to think that it decides how happy people are .
now , because the self that you step back is the one who sends , you can end -- some people can end california .
and it &apos;s interesting to discover what happens to people who move to california with the hope to be happier .
well , his self that has experiences is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but it &apos;s going to happen one thing . they &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because , when you think about it , you &apos;ll remember how awful it was in ohio , and you &apos;ll think they made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about well @-@ being , and i hope to give you an idea of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you very much .
when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned there was a very interesting result that came out of the gallup poll .
is there something that can tell us , because there &apos;s still some time left yet ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the gallup poll is a number , which is not surprising to find at all .
we found that number with respect to the happiness of me that has experiences .
when you look at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out , below about 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 60,000 dollars a year , is a representative sample significant , under the income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 <unk> .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re much more unhappy as poor they are .
but above that threshold , we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen very flat lines .
now , obviously , what happens is money does not buy the happiness of our experiences , but the lack of money with security produces the misery , and we can measure that misery very precisely .
in terms of the other self , the self that reminds , the story is different .
the more money you make more happy .
that &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , the leading american challenge focuses on life , freedom and search for happiness .
if people take this statement seriously , it seems to me to reframe everything we believe about , say , the fiscal policy and issues like that .
is there any possible possibility that politicians , that the country in general , i took this very seriously and established public policy on it ?
<unk> : you know that i think there &apos;s a recognition of the role of research in public policy .
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , there &apos;s no doubt about it , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s recognizing , and in other countries it &apos;s recognizing .
people recognize that they have to think about happiness when they think about public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study the happiness of our experiences , or whether they want to study the <unk> of life , so we have to have that debate pretty soon .
how do you increase happiness , you see in different ways depending on what you think , and if you do it on the self that you remember or the self that has experiences .
that &apos;s going to influence public policy , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , it &apos;s trying to measure the experience of the population .
this will form , in the next decade or next , part of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , that this subject is going to be , or at least it should be , the most interesting political argument to develop in the next few years .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
thank you danny <unk>
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal , game designer .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years . my goal for the next decade is to try to make the world so easy to save the world in real life as it is in the world of online games .
and i have a plan to do that , and that &apos;s supposed to convince more people to join you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
today , we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; it &apos;s a lot of time to get games . &quot;
maybe too long , consider the number of problems to solve in the real world .
but actually , according to my research , at the institute for <unk> actually the opposite happens .
three billion hours a week is not enough play time to solve the most intractable problems .
in fact , i think if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase that radically .
i &apos;ve calculated the total need in 21 billion hours of play a week .
it &apos;s probably a little intuitive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , that makes a dent . if we want to solve problems like : hunger , climate change , global conflicts , obesity , i think we have to aspire to online for at least 21 billion hours a week for the end of the next decade .
no , i really say .
here &apos;s why , this picture sums up a lot of why i think games are essential for the future survival of the human species . seriously .
this is a portrait of a photographer called timothy <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotion of play , so he put a camera in front of the players while he was playing .
this is a classic emotion in games .
now , if you don &apos;t play a few nuances in this picture .
you probably see the sense of urgency , maybe a little bit of fear , but intense concentration to tackle a really complex problem .
if you would play <unk> here some nuances , the guts of your eyes and around your mouth is a sign of optimism , and your eyebrows up is surprise .
this is a player about something called <unk> triumph .
you &apos;ve heard that . okay . okay . so there &apos;s players among us .
<unk> triumph is such an extraordinarily positive result that you didn &apos;t know it was possible until it achieved it .
i was almost beyond what you might think .
and when you get to that , you &apos;re surprised to discover what you were able to do . that &apos;s a <unk> triumph .
this is a player on the edge of a <unk> triumph .
and this is the face that we need to see in millions of different kinds of problems around the world as we measure the obstacles of the next century : someone &apos;s face , against all kinds of bet , is on the edge of a <unk> triumph .
unfortunately , this is the face that we see in everyday life when we try to address pressing problems .
this is what i call &quot; <unk> &quot; -- i &apos;m not good in life . &quot; and this is me putting that face up . do you see it ? yes , good .
that &apos;s me putting a face of &quot; i &apos;m not great in life . &quot;
this is a graffiti graffiti in my former berkeley neighborhood , california , where i did my ph.d. from why we &apos;re better at games than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we feel we &apos;re not as good in reality as games .
and i &apos;m not just saying good in terms of success , even though it &apos;s part of that .
we get more in game worlds , but i also want to say good in terms of motivation to do something important that inspires and cooperate .
and when we &apos;re in the worlds of games , i think a lot of us become the best version of ourselves , the most willing to help instantly , the toughest to follow a problem that is necessary , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we fail , when we often miss obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing online , it just doesn &apos;t exist in games .
so , i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what about games makes us feel -- there &apos;s nothing we can &apos;t accomplish ?
how can we take these feelings of games and play them to the work of the real world ?
so , i play games like world of warcraft , which is really an ideal environment of collaborative resolution solutions .
and i started looking at some things that make the success possible on online worlds .
the first thing is , whenever you come up with one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters that are immediately willing to benefit with a mission that <unk> the world .
but not any mission , but a mission that <unk> perfectly with the current level of one in the game , right ?
so you can do it .
they never give you a challenge you cannot achieve .
but it &apos;s at the edge of what you &apos;re capable of , so you have to deal with it , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
there &apos;s no such thing that you sit in your hands . there &apos;s always something specific and important to do .
and there &apos;s also a lot of collaborators .
wherever you go , there are hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to get your epic mission .
it &apos;s not something that we have in real life so easily this sense that in the palm of hand there &apos;s a whole bunch of collaborators .
and there &apos;s also this epic story , this inspiring story of why we &apos;re there , what we &apos;re doing .
and then there &apos;s all that positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about raising levels and strength + 1 , and intelligence + 1 .
we don &apos;t have that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when i leave the stage , i &apos;m not going to go + 1 , crazy idea + 1 , or crazy idea , 20 + 20 .
i don &apos;t have that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with online collaborative settings like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s as satisfying to the edge of a triumph , all the time we decided to spend all of our time in these darwinian worlds .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so far , all the world players of warcraft have spent millions of years solving the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might seem bad .
but to put it in context : <unk> million years ago , our human ancestors stood up .
that was the first primate walk .
so when we talk about how long we invest in online games , the only way that makes sense even think about it , is to talk about the time in the magnitude of human evolution that &apos;s extraordinary .
but it &apos;s a good thing . because it turns out that all this time playing online , we &apos;re actually changing what we &apos;re able to do as human beings .
we &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and <unk> .
it &apos;s true . i believe this .
consider this really interesting statistic . it was published recently by a carnegie mellon researcher , the average young woman today in a country that has labeled game culture , there will be 10,000 hours playing online for the 21 years .
now , 10,000 hours is really an interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for the american kids , <unk> hours , it &apos;s the exact time it will be in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if they have perfect assistance .
so we have a whole parallel education path going on where young people learn so much about what you need to be a good player in the same way as everything else in school .
many of you may have probably read the new book by <unk> gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
you &apos;ve heard of his success theory of the success theory of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can get over 10,000 hours of biomedical study , in something for the age of 21 , we &apos;ll be planning on that .
we &apos;re going to be as good at what we &apos;re doing as the great person on the planet .
and , now that we think about it , there &apos;s an entire generation of young people who are gamers to play .
so the big question is , &quot; what are these players doing ? &quot;
because if we could know that we would have something virtually unprecedented , these human resources in our hands .
this is how we now have a lot of people in the world who spend at least an hour playing online .
these are our gamers dancing . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion extremely good players in whatever .
if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s coming .
the games industry is developing <unk> that consume little energy , and they work with wireless phone networks instead of broadband internet so that the players of the world in particular from india , china , brazil , can access .
they expect a billion more players in the next decade .
it will get us to 1.5 billion players .
so i &apos;ve started thinking , what are these games doing to us dancing .
here are the four things i found . the first is the urgent optimism .
well , think of this as an extreme self @-@ motivation .
the urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to deal with a combined barrier to the belief that we have a reasonable success hope .
players always believe that it &apos;s possible to succeed and it &apos;s always worth trying , and doing it now .
they &apos;re not sitting there doing nothing .
players are <unk> <unk> the social plot .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that show that we like most people after playing with them even if they &apos;ve been beat up .
and the reason is that it demands a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they &apos;re going to spend their time with us that they &apos;re going to play under the same rules as the same goal , they &apos;re going to stay in the game all the way down .
so playing a game together actually builds ties and trust and cooperation .
and as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
productivity <unk> . i love it .
there &apos;s a reason why the average player of world warcraft plays 22 hours a week like a half @-@ hour job .
it &apos;s because we know that , when we play a game , we &apos;re actually happier working a lot , relaxed or hanging out .
we know that we are human beings , doing a significant job .
players are willing to work a lot of the time , if you give them the proper work .
finally , the <unk> purpose .
players love amazing human history missions .
so , some data to put that in perspective . everyone knows wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki in the world , with about 80,000 articles is the wiki of warcraft .
five million people use it a month .
there &apos;s more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other <unk> covered in any other wiki in the world .
they &apos;re building a epic story .
they &apos;re building a resource of <unk> knowledge about world of warcraft .
well , these are four superpowers who come to be one thing . players are optimistic individuals with superpowers .
these are people who believe that they are able to individually change the world .
and the only problem is they think they &apos;re capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist named edward <unk> .
his job is brilliant . he studies why people spend so much time , energy , money online worlds .
and it says , &quot; we are seeing quantities -- not lower to a massive <unk> -- to virtual worlds and online environments . &quot;
and it &apos;s an economist , and therefore rational .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a game designer , i &apos;m exuberant .
but he says that this has all the meaning because players can achieve more in virtual worlds than in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life . they have better feedback and they feel more rewarded in games than in real life .
so he says that he now has the whole sense that players spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world .
i also think that &apos;s rational , for now .
but it &apos;s not , in any way , an optimal situation .
we have to begin to make the real world more like a game .
i was inspired by something that happened 2,500 years ago .
these are ancient dice , made out of sheep <unk> . right ?
before the fantastic game controllers , we had <unk> .
and these represent the first game team designed by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historian , you know this story . it &apos;s the story of who and why he invented games .
<unk> says that games , in particular the dice , were invented in the realm of hunger .
apparently there was such a serious famine that the king of deals decided they had to do something crazy .
people suffered . people suffered .
it was an extreme situation . they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to indyk , the games of dice and a policy was established throughout the kingdom : one day , everybody would eat , and the next day , everybody would eat .
and they would be so <unk> in the start of dice because games are so attractive , and they dip us into such <unk> productivity and <unk> the fact that they have great <unk> .
and then the next day , we &apos;re playing the day , and the other day we feed the food feed .
and , according to <unk> , they lived 18 years like this , surviving famine on a day , playing the next day .
i think that &apos;s exactly the way games are used today .
we play to get away from the suffering of the real world .
we use games to get rid of all that &apos;s broken in the real environment , all we don &apos;t get tired of the real world and take what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is very exciting .
according to <unk> , after 18 years , famine had not <unk> , so the king decided to start a end of dice .
we will split two parts the entire kingdom .
they played a game by dice and the winners of the game play will fit into a epic adventure .
they &apos;re trying , and they &apos;re going to take a new home , leaving enough people to survive with the resources available , and hopefully to bring civilization to some place where they could thrive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , evidence of dna has shown that the <unk> that <unk> into the <unk> empire actually shared the same dna with the ancient <unk> .
and so , recently , scientists have suggested that the crazy story of <unk> is true .
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted about 20 years , which would explain hunger .
so this crazy story could be true .
they could have really saved their culture playing games for 18 years and then inspired as they knew as much as they went forward with games that really saved the whole civilization in this way .
well , we can do that .
we &apos;ve played warcraft since 1994 .
it was the first game of strategy in real time of the world series of warcraft . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
they had half the civilization to go for a new world . that &apos;s where i have my 21 billion hours a week of games .
we half of us spend an hour a day playing games to solve problems in the real world .
i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real problems in the real world in games ? &quot; well , i &apos;ve spent my work in the last few years at the institute for <unk> .
we have this poster in our offices in palo alto and express our vision of how we should relate to the future .
we don &apos;t want to try and predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the result of the best stage in one case , and then we encourage people to make reality .
we want to imagine <unk> wins , and then give people the means to make fun .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i &apos;ve made that they &apos;re an attempt to give people the media to create <unk> gains in their future .
this is &quot; <unk> world . &quot;
we did this game in 2007 .
this is an online game that you &apos;re trying to survive an oil droplet .
the oil <unk> is <unk> , but we put enough online content there to create that it &apos;s true and live their real lives as if the oil had been finished , and so when they come into the game , they tell us where they live , and then we spend the news in real data sources that show exactly , how much oil it costs , how it costs them to live the transportation supply and how it &apos;s going .
we did a players &apos; team in 2007 , and we followed them for three years .
and i can tell you , it &apos;s a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change the way of life only because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
but if you immerse them in a epic adventure and says , &quot; we are left without oil . &quot;
this is an amazing story and an adventure to help you out .
tell yourself to survive in that world . a lot of players have been keeping their habits in this game .
so , for the next game that we confront the world , we decided to aim higher , a bigger problem for oil .
we did a game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for <unk> .
the premise was that a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the world extinction system , of course .
we asked people to build online , almost like a jerry <unk> movie .
you know , in the jerry <unk> movies , they form an ideal team . they have the astronaut , the scientist , former <unk> , everybody has something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people in the ideal team , we said , they &apos;re all in the ideal team , and it &apos;s your goal to invent the future of energy , the future of food , for health , the future of security and the social security network .
we did play 8,000 people that game for eight weeks .
there were 500 creative solutions that can go in and see if you can call them &quot; <unk> . &quot;
finally , the last game . we &apos;re launching march 3 : this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you end the game , you will be certified by the institute of the world bank , as social innovative , class 2010 .
working with the universities of all sub @-@ saharan africa , and we &apos;re encouraged to learn social innovation skills .
we have a graphic novel . we have <unk> in skills like local knowledge , networks of knowledge , sustainability , vision and invention .
i would like to invite all of you to share , please , this game with young people from all over the world , in particular areas of development that they could benefit from the union to try and start imagining their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to take you now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have all these games that are pilots that could be done , but none of them have saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are a human resource that we can use in real world jobs that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these <unk> superpowers , the ability to spin a solid social plot , this urgent feeling , and the desire for the <unk> purpose .
i really hope that together we can play games that we play , to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll join me and play games like this .
when i look over the next decade , i know two things with security : that we can make any future we imagine , and we can play all kinds of games that we play .
so i say , let &apos;s start the games that change the world .
thank you .
i want to share with you a discovery that i did some months while i was writing an article for the italian editing of wired magazine .
i always have my hand @-@ <unk> dictionary when i &apos;m writing something , but i had already finished editing my article when i realized that i never in my life had looked for the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what i found .
let me read you what it says .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , injured , injured , injured , <unk> , maimed , traumatized , tired , spent , <unk> , impotent , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , sick , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , covered , with nerves -- <unk> , also <unk> , and weak .
<unk> , healthy , strong , able . &quot;
i was reading this in a high voice to a friend , and at first i was laughing , i was so ridiculous , but i just had to read &quot; <unk> , &quot; when my voice had collapsed and had to stop and get rid of the emotional crash and the impact that these words <unk> .
you know , of course , this was my old and old @-@ fashioned -- i thought it had to be an old , clear editing .
but , in fact , it was an early edition of the &apos; 80s when i had to be starting elementary school and getting a sense of myself outside the familiar core and related to all the other kids and the world around me .
and , needless to say , because of god i didn &apos;t use a <unk> at that time .
i mean , according to this definition , i would seem to be born in a world that would remind someone to me that i had absolutely no positive to give , when , in fact , i am famous for the opportunities and adventures that my life has brought me .
so , immediately i went to look at the online edition of 2009 , hoping to find a decent review .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this word .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; particularly <unk> , &quot; &quot; complete &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just a question of words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we talk to them with these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we built those values .
our language affects our way of thinking and how we see the world , and how we see other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the greeks and roman , believed that a <unk> is very powerful , because he <unk> in a loud voice made it .
so , what is the reality that we want to create , the one person that is limited , or a person who has control of itself ?
by the mere fact of doing something as simple as a name of a person , a child , we could be transparent and <unk> its capacity .
wouldn &apos;t we want , instead , open doors ?
a person like this , who opened my door , was my childhood doctor at the institute , <unk> , <unk> .
his name is dr. <unk> . an italian @-@ origin american , whose name , apparently , was too difficult to say to most of his americans , so he would make him <unk> just dr. p.
and dr. p always wore very colorful <unk> and had the perfect fitness to work with kids .
i enjoyed most of the time i spent in the hospital , except for my sessions sessions .
i had to do what seemed to me to do with these thick rubber bands -- different colors -- you know , to help strengthen the muscles of my legs . and i hated these gangs more than anything else . hated them , hated them . hated them . hated them .
and , you know , i was already <unk> , with only five years of age , with dr. p to try and quit these exercises , no success , of course .
and , one day , she came to my session -- <unk> and <unk> , and she said , &quot; oh , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , so powerful , i think you &apos;re going to break up one of those bands .
when i unfold it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple <unk> part of dr. p for me to get the exercises that i didn &apos;t want to do before the possibility of being the five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the second floor room , but what he actually did for me was to transform a daily event that was horrible in a very promising experience for me .
and i have to wonder today , to what extent their vision , and having kicked out a very strong , powerful girl , shaped my vision of myself in the future as a strong , powerful , powerful and athletic .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can actually light the energy of a child .
however , in the definitions of <unk> that we previously saw , our language cannot allow us to develop into the reality that we all want , the possibility that a person can see itself as capable .
our language has not been put everyday with changes in our society , many of which have been caused by technology .
certainly , from a medical perspective , my legs , laser surgery to improve vision , knee @-@ shaped devices and hip made out of mature titanium in people , all of which are enabling people to develop more their faculties , and move beyond their own boundaries that nature has imposed on them , not to mention the social networking platforms , which allow people to build their own groups .
so , maybe the technology is giving us now more clearly what &apos;s always been a truth , that each person has a little bit of common and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is the bigger advantage we have .
the human ability to adapt , which is an interesting thing , because people have constantly wanted to talk to me about overcoming the adversity , and i &apos;m going to admit something . that phrase never stuck with me , and i always felt uncomfortable trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m beginning to realize why .
in this particular phrase of overcoming the adversity , there is the idea that success , or happiness , is going through a <unk> challenge or not being affected by the experience , as if my successes in life were the result of a ability to fight or <unk> the difficulties of a whole life with or what other people experience as my disability .
but , in fact , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re affected , of course , by a challenge , whether it &apos;s physical , emotionally , or in both ways .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adversity is not a barrier that we need to be around so we can take our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of this as if it were my shadow .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and certainly , i &apos;m not trying to minimize the impact , the weight , the fight of a person .
there are adversity and challenges in life , and it &apos;s a different reality for every person , but the question isn &apos;t whether you &apos;re going to or not have to confront adversity , but how you &apos;re going to face it .
so , our responsibility is not simply to isolate the adversity from those who we want to , but to make sure that we &apos;re going to get it right .
and we don &apos;t do them any favors our children when we make them feel they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
there &apos;s a major difference between the objective medical fact that i have the <unk> legs and the subjective opinion of society about whether i am or not disabled .
and frankly , the only real and consistent disability that i &apos;ve had to deal with is that the world would think those definitions describe to me .
in our desire to protect those who we love giving them the hard and cold truth about their doctor &apos;s forecast or a <unk> of the quality of life that you might expect , we must make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick into a wall that will ultimately encourage someone .
maybe the existing model of just looking at what &apos;s damaged in you and how to fix it , causes the more disability than pathology in itself .
by not treating the person in their totality , by not recognizing their potential , we &apos;re creating another <unk> about any natural struggle that can already have .
we &apos;re putting a score on the value that someone has for our community .
so we need to look beyond pathology and within the range of human capacity .
and , more importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those <unk> and our greatest creative skill .
so it &apos;s not about underestimate , or <unk> , those moments of greater proof as something we want to avoid or hide , but rather than that , it &apos;s about finding those opportunities that are hidden inside of adversity .
so , maybe , the idea that i want to say is , not so much to overcome adversity , but to <unk> her , to <unk> her , to use a term of professional struggle , perhaps even to engage her .
and perhaps , if we look at adversity as something that is natural and consistent and useful , we &apos;ll be less for their presence .
this year we celebrate the 200 years of the birth of charles darwin , and 150 years ago , when he was writing about evolution , darwin set up , i think , a truth about the character of human beings .
to celebrate them , it &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , it &apos;s not the smartest of the one who survives , but the one who fits the change .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , among others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and thrive is propelled by the fight of the human spirit through conflict and towards transformation .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human ability .
and maybe it &apos;s not until we &apos;re <unk> , we know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe this is what adversity gives us a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give us a gift .
we can rethink adversity as something more than just difficult times .
maybe we can see it as a change .
adversity is only a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created is the idea of normal .
tell me , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the common . there &apos;s the typical . there &apos;s no normal thing . and , would you want to meet those poor people , the <unk> color , if they exist ?
i don &apos;t think .
if we can change this paradigm and move from one that seeks to reach normal to another possibility , or strength , to be a little more risky , we can release the power of so many other kids , and invite them to put the service of the community those strange and valuable skills that they own .
anthropologists tell us that what we as humans have always been required by the members of our community is that they are useful , that they are able to contribute .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , <unk> their elders , and those with severe physical lesions , perhaps given that the experience of survival experience in the life of these people proved to be value for the community .
they didn &apos;t see these people as being damaged or useless ; they looked at them as unusual and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the village where i grew up in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing ahead of a tomato package .
it was summer . i had some short pants .
i hear this man , talking behind me saying , &quot; well , if this is not aimee . &quot;
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this old man . i have no idea who he is .
and i say , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , do we know ? i don &apos;t remember . &quot;
and he says , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think you remember when i met .
i mean , when we met , he was <unk> from the belly of your mother . &quot;
oh , that person .
and , of course , i realized there .
he was dr. <unk> , who i knew only through the stories that my mother told me about that day , because , of course , as he &apos;s normally in me , i came two weeks later to my birth .
so , my mother &apos;s <unk> had gone on holiday , so the man who made my birth was a complete stranger for my parents .
and , since i was born without the bones of the <unk> , and i had the feet attached to it , and a few fingers on this foot , and a few in this one , he had to be who &apos;s carrying , this strange had to be who led the bad news .
he said , &quot; i had to give you the forecast to your parents that you would never forget , and that you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids had or any kind of independent life , and you &apos;ve been like a liar ever since . &quot;
the amazing thing is , he told me that he had saved newspaper cuts throughout my whole childhood , whether it was out of the time , i won a <unk> competition , second grade it with the <unk> <unk> , you know , at the <unk> parade , when i won my college scholarship or any of my entrepreneurs , and i used this stuff , and i <unk> it up their medical classes .
and he called this part of the course of the x @-@ ray , the potential of the human will .
no forecast can determine how powerful this can be as a <unk> of the quality of a person &apos;s life .
and dr. <unk> kept saying to me , &quot; in my experience , unless you give it a lot of times the opposite , and even if you just give it a very minimal support , if you let it flow only , a child will achieve success . &quot;
see , dr. <unk> made that change of thought .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the health problem and what a person can do despite the same .
and i myself have changed my way to think about time , because , if you had asked me when i was 15 years old , if i would have changed the prostheses of the skin and bone , i wouldn &apos;t have <unk> for a second .
at that time , he would react to that kind of normal .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences that i &apos;ve had with them , not despite the experiences that i &apos;ve had with them .
and , perhaps , this change in my mind has occurred because i &apos;ve been in contact with more people who have been open doors to me than those who have put <unk> and shadows on me .
you know , all you need is a person who opens your eyes to your own power , and you take off .
if you could give someone the key to their own power , the human spirit is so responsive , if you could do that and open a door to someone at a pivotal moment , you &apos;re <unk> in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching yourself to open doors .
in fact , the exact meaning of the english word &quot; <unk> &quot; comes from the root &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means , stimulate what &apos;s inside , manifest the potential .
so , again , what is the potential that we want to put on manifest ?
a case study was done in britain , in the 1960s , when the system was changing the income system at high school , one that required income test for another which was open .
they call that the evidence of separation in groups . here in the united states , we call it <unk> .
it &apos;s about separating students to a , b , c , etc .
and the students a get the most difficult curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took students from the vitamin d level , and for a three @-@ month period , they gave them the highest notes , and they told them that they were high @-@ level students , they said they were brilliant , and at the end of that three @-@ month period , they were <unk> at an a.
and of course , the <unk> <unk> of this study , is that they took the students from level a , and they said they were level .
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three @-@ month period .
with those who were still in school , amongst those who had already been abandoned .
one crucial part of this case study was that teachers were also deceived .
teachers didn &apos;t know that there was a change .
they were just told that these were the students a , and these were the students , d. and that &apos;s how they were encouraged to teach them and to support them .
so , i think the only real disability is a <unk> spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been <unk> doesn &apos;t have hope . you don &apos;t see beauty . it doesn &apos;t have our natural curiosity , child and our innate ability to imagine .
if , instead of that , we can <unk> a human spirit to have hope , to see beauty in itself and others , so it &apos;s imaginative and curious , then we &apos;re really using our power .
when a spirit has these qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
i would like to leave you with a poem by a persian poet from the 14th century , named <unk> of who told me my friend , jacques <unk> , and the poem is called &quot; god who only knows four <unk> . &quot; every child has known god , not the god of the different names , not the god of what you can &apos;t do , but you can only see the four words .
come and dance with me . thank you .
would you like to be better than they are ?
suppose i told you that , with only a few changes in your genes , they could improve your memory -- for a more precise , more accurate and faster .
or maybe they would like to be better shape , to be stronger , to have more resilience .
would you like to be more attractive and confident ?
what about living in good health ?
or maybe it &apos;s one of those people who always wanted to be more creative .
what else would you like ?
what would you like , if you could choose something ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
hands up . let me see .
few . probably it &apos;s because of the number of creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose your memory ?
a few more .
and the physical state ?
a little less .
what about longevity ?
oh , most of them . that makes me feel really good as a doctor .
if they could have some of this , the world would be very different .
is it just imagination ?
or maybe it &apos;s possible ?
evolution has been a theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to look at you from a doctor on the subject .
the great 20th @-@ century male , <unk> <unk> , who also <unk> in the most unorthodox church , wrote a essay called &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except for the light of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those people who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a good time to turn off your hearing aids , throwing away your personal communication devices -- i give you <unk> , and maybe , let &apos;s turn out the book of being wrong , because , none of the rest of this talk is going to make a little sense for you .
but if you actually accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just the past , or the future ?
is it about others or us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in that picture , i put a bush in the middle , and it <unk> across all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , each species that &apos;s there on the tips of those branches has been successful in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has shown an adaptation to its environment .
the human part of this branch , well at an extreme end , is , of course , the most interest to us .
they came from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some of them have gone and back .
we &apos;ve been here for a few years .
it might seem that we &apos;re very far from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , mostly the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same .
do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that &apos;s used to treat diabetes ?
this is not like human insulin ; this is the same protein , chemically <unk> , which comes out of your pancreas .
and talking about bacteria -- do you realize that we all carry into the much more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body ?
maybe 10 times more .
i mean , think -- when antonio <unk> asks the thing of self @-@ image -- do you think about bacteria ?
the gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , dark , wet . it &apos;s very <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to provide all the nutrients that they can want without effort in their part .
it &apos;s really like a fast pathway for bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some rush to the output .
but , on the other hand , we &apos;re a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life .
they help digest essential nutrients , and they protect us from certain diseases .
but what would we regret the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species ?
or destined to become something different , something maybe better adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s take a step back in time , to the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of proto @-@ life maybe three to four billion years ago in the early <unk> organisms , maybe about 800 to 1,000 million years ago , and then the human species that finally appears at the last 130 billion years .
in this vast <unk> symphony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief compass ; the animal kingdom , like one and only <unk> , and human life , a tiny note of grace .
that was us .
and it was also the neat part of this talk , so i hope you enjoyed it .
when i first got to college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : most of the existence of life , in the one @-@ celled organisms , each cell simply divides and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two stem cells .
but when organisms appear , things start to change .
it enters the sex reproduction scene .
and something very important : the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome , the rest of the body becomes <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the body &apos;s death penalty <unk> comes into evolution at the same time in sexual reproduction .
i have to claim that when i was a college student , i thought , well , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex ; it seemed quite reasonable at that time , but every year that was happening , every time i had more doubts .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns , which was still acting in las vegas well in his 90s .
and one night , someone grabs his hotel door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , there &apos;s this wonderful , <unk> dancer .
he looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a sex soup . &quot;
&quot; okay , &quot; george says , &quot; i pick the soup . &quot;
i realized , as a doctor , who was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily counterintuitive , just different .
he was trying to preserve the body .
i wanted us to be healthy .
i wanted to get health into the disease .
i wanted us to live more and healthier .
evolution is about passing the genome into the next generation , <unk> and generation after generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are sort of like reinforcing rockets designed to send the genetics to the next mars level , and then let us fall into the sea .
i think everyone <unk> the feeling that woody allen when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
i want to make them not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily help longevity .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily help the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the smartest .
evolution encourages the best @-@ adapted creatures to their surroundings .
that &apos;s the only proof of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , the pathogenic bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that they would make , if there were fish there , fish in empty , yet , they &apos;ve managed to make that a <unk> environment .
so , what does this mean , when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and , in particular , if we look forward to the next phase -- i would say there &apos;s a lot of possibilities .
the first is , don &apos;t get it .
we have reached a kind of balance .
and the underlying reasoning would be that , through medicine , for the first place , we &apos;ve been able to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been <unk> and removed from the population .
and second , as a species , we have <unk> our environment so that we adapt to ourselves as we adapt to it .
and by the way , <unk> , <unk> , and we get so excited that it &apos;s no longer possible to have the isolation necessary to make evolution .
a second possibility is that there is a evolution of the traditional , natural type , <unk> by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be : the gears of evolution roll it slowly , but they &apos;re slow .
and as soon as the isolation : when as a sort of distant planets are going to exist , the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , intriguing and terrifying possibility .
i call it &quot; neo @-@ evolution , &quot; the new evolution , which is not just natural -- but <unk> , and for us as individuals in the decisions we &apos;re going to take .
now , how could this happen ?
how could we get to do this ?
first , consider the reality that many people today , in some cultures , are making decisions about their offspring .
in some cultures , they &apos;re choosing to have more boys than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily a good thing for society , but it &apos;s what choice at the individual and family level .
think also , if it was possible to be able to choose not only the sex of their offspring , but in their own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease .
what if we could make the genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or decrease the risk of cancer or eliminating <unk> ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if you look into the future , that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it took <unk> million dollars .
the next year of being done , in 2004 , i could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months .
today , you can get a complete sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs in the human genome at a very close cost to 20,000 dollars and in a week .
don &apos;t make a lot of money to make the human genome come true for 1,000 dollars , and it will be increasingly within reach of everyone .
just a week ago , the national academy of engineering awarded his nobel prize <unk> to francis arnold and <unk> , two scientists who developed techniques independently to make the evolutionary process work faster and adapt to protein in a much more efficient way , which <unk> calls &quot; evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the <unk> prize was given to the scientist <unk> by his research in which he took a adult skin cell , a <unk> , and only four genes <unk> that cell to become a <unk> stem cell : a able , in power , any cell in the body .
those changes come .
the same technology that &apos;s produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that aren &apos;t just going to protect us from themselves , but they &apos;re going to induce other viruses .
believe it or there is no experimental trial underway with flu vaccine versus flu cells from a tobacco plant .
can you imagine something good about tobacco ?
that &apos;s actually today , and in the future it &apos;s going to be increasingly possible .
so imagine only two other small changes .
they can change the cells in their bodies , but if they could change the cells of their offspring ?
what if they could change sperm and <unk> , or change the <unk> <unk> , and give their kids a better chance of a healthier life , eliminate diabetes , removing <unk> , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then , that same analytical technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease is going to allow us also to adopt super hyper @-@ connected -- a better memory .
why not have the ingenuity of a ken jennings sitting on everything if you could hit the next generation of the machine ?
why don &apos;t we have a push muscle faster than we can run faster and farther ?
why not live longer ?
this is going to be compelling .
and when we &apos;re in conditions of navigating this to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have turned the evolution of before in the neocortex .
we &apos;re going to take a process that could typically take 100,000 years , and we can give it to 1,000 years , and maybe even within the next 100 years .
these are choices that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have them .
are we going to use these choices in terms of a better , more successful , more successful society ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others ?
are we going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust ?
this is the kind of question we &apos;re going to have to deal with .
and most profound of all , are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom that we need to make these decisions wisely ?
for good or for bad , and before you might think , these choices are going to depend on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a robot that can carry and gives you self @-@ support capabilities or whatever it does to make wheelchair users lift up and walk again .
we call these robots , <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing different than something you put in the morning , it gives a very strong force , which also increases its velocity , and helps him , for example , to manage balance .
it &apos;s actually the true integration of man and machine .
but not only that -- it can integrate and connect it to the universe and with other outside entities .
this is not an unreal idea .
to show you now what we &apos;re working on to talk about the american soldier , on average , has to carry on his back a 45 @-@ pound load , and he &apos;s still getting more equipment .
obviously , this leads to some very important complications -- in the back , in 30 percent of soldiers -- with <unk> damage .
we decided to contemplate this challenge and create a <unk> that could help deal with the issue .
let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> human <unk> .
soldiers : with the <unk> <unk> , i can save 90 kilos for terrain for many hours .
its flexible design , it allows you to fit into a lot of <unk> and perform movement with great agility .
it feels what i want to do , or where i want to go , and then it increases my strength and my resistance .
we &apos;re ready , with our industrial partner , to produce this device , this new <unk> , this year .
i mean , it &apos;s a reality .
now , look back at the wheelchair users , which i feel particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people around , in wheelchair chairs , around the world .
like one percent of the total population .
and this is a really conservative calculation .
we talk about something that often happens , very young people , no harm in the column that begins their lives -- 20 , 30 or 40 years old -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice .
we also talk about the aging population that &apos;s rapidly blown away .
his only choice , many times -- because of brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair .
and this has been , over the last 500 years , from its successful emergence , as i should recognize .
so we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility .
let me introduce you to the <unk> that &apos;s using amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a lesion in the column , and as a result he couldn &apos;t walk again for 19 years , until now .
thank you .
so amanda is using our <unk> , which mentioned .
it has a few sensors .
completely non @-@ invasive on the crutches they send signals to the computer on board , here on the back .
also , here are some batteries that give energy to the engines on the hip , and on the knees , and move it forward with this smooth , very natural gait .
i was 24 years old at the very top of my life when , for a strange jump in the air , skiing up i was paralyzed .
in a fraction of a second , i lost all sensation and all the movement of the pelvis down .
shortly after that , a doctor came into my room in the hospital , and he said , &quot; amanda , you never walk . &quot;
that happened 19 years ago .
so he robbed me up to the last grain of hope for me .
the <unk> technology , ever since , has allowed me to learn how to fix it , costs down , climb rocks and even ride a hand bike .
but they haven &apos;t invented anything that enables me to walk , so far .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms for sitting and talking to you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to transform life to future generations -- not just soldiers , but amanda , and all wheelchair users , everyone .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m responsible for developing a non @-@ profit organization called robin <unk> .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m running fires like a captain &apos;s <unk> in a volunteer fire .
and , in our city , where volunteers have trained a highly skilled staff , you have to get to the burning site very soon enough to get in action .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the site , so i had a fairly high probability of going .
but there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and find out what our task was .
when i found the captain , i was disillusioned in a conversation with the owner who certainly went through one of the worst days of his life .
we were in full evening , she was standing outside in the rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , and her house was on fire .
the other volunteer who had just arrived before me , <unk> <unk> <unk> came first to the captain and he asked her to support the dog of the house .
the dog ! i was so <unk> !
there was a lawyer or <unk> of money , which , for the rest of his life , he would have to tell the people who walked into a burning building to save a single living , because he won me for five seconds .
well , i was the following .
the captain made me a <unk> .
he said , &quot; noah , i need to go to the house .
i need you to come up , grab the fire , and i bring this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
it wasn &apos;t exactly what i expected but i went -- i got up the stairs , at the end of the hall , i went to the real <unk> that at the very height or so they had just finished turning off the fire , and i went into the main room for a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i took my load back up the ladder where i met my <unk> and the lovely dog at the front door .
we removed from the house , the <unk> for the owner of the house where , as was to wait , his treasure , he got much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the brave effort to save his house .
the kindness that she watched for what else was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes .
both in my calling in robin <unk> , as in my firefighter as a volunteer , i witnessed acts of generosity and kindness in a monumental scale , but also acts of grace and courage on the individual level .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
everything has its importance .
so , when i look in this room to people who have managed , or are for achieving , remarkable success levels , i would like to remind you this : no wait .
don &apos;t wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
if you have something to give , give it up now .
we <unk> food in a dining hall , we have a neighborhood park .
be mentors .
not every day , we &apos;re going to have a chance to save someone &apos;s life , but every day we &apos;re going to be able to influence someone &apos;s life .
so , go into the game . save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women have the baton , they practice sex to say hello , and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not the hot man or san francisco festival .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
this is the world of the wild bonobos ?
the bonobos are , along with chimpanzees , their closest living relatives .
that means that we all share a common ancestry , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve made a lot of focus on this aspect of human evolution .
but the bonobos now show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees are dominated by large , terrifying guys , the bonobo is in charge of females with power .
these guys have created something special , because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence has not yet been observed .
but unfortunately , the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes .
they live in the deep sea of the rainforest , and it &apos;s been very difficult to study them .
congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the <unk> itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has gone through long decades and caused almost as many deaths as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that this destruction also <unk> the survival of the bonobo .
the trade of hunting and deforestation is that they can &apos;t fill up a stadium with the bonobos that remain in the world -- and honestly , we &apos;re not sure of it .
however , on this land of violence and chaos , you can hear something hidden behind the trees .
who are these cousins ?
we know them as the apes , do love , not war , because they have frequent sex , <unk> and bisexual to deal and solve social problems .
i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity , because the life of the bonobo is more than the <unk> .
the bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire life .
playing is not just a game of kids .
for us and for them , play is fundamental to create ties and to encourage tolerance .
we learn to trust him , and we learn the rules of play .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look at the game bonobo , you see the evolutionary roots of laughter , dance and ritual .
play is the glue that binds us .
i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild .
first , it &apos;s a game of golden bonobo , and i don &apos;t talk about soccer .
here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a chase .
look what she &apos;s doing .
it could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , &quot; he has caught it in the balls . &quot;
i just think in this case he loves him , right ?
yes .
so , sex play is both common with bonobos and humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the footage of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> -- and at the same time , it &apos;s all fun .
but play is <unk> .
the game is <unk> , it can take many forms , some of which are more <unk> , <unk> , weird -- maybe the place where you get to wonder .
and i want you to see -- this is <unk> , a young female , who is playing with <unk> water .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and explore the boundaries of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we create are the actual <unk> of creativity .
these are just little samples of the understanding that the bonobo gives us from our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future in which we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with creativity and greater cooperation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capabilities .
in other words , play is our <unk> of adaptation .
to successfully adapt to a world that changes we have to play .
but do we really enjoy our game capacity ?
play is not <unk> .
play is essential .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just cruel and evil .
when it seems the least appropriate to play , it can be the moments when it &apos;s the most urgent .
so , our primates , let &apos;s accept this gift of evolution and play together while preserving creativity , friendship and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two partners in 1979 , the same day , exactly at the same time , each one baby . okay .
so , two partners each with a baby .
i don &apos;t want you to be arrested too much in the details of conception , because if you stop thinking about understanding , you &apos;re not going to pay attention to me .
let &apos;s think about that for a moment .
and in this scenario , i want you to imagine that , in a case , the sex chromosome joins the x @-@ chromosome .
and in the other case , the x @-@ chromosome joins the x @-@ chromosome of the egg .
both <unk> and life begins .
we &apos;ll come back and talk about them later .
i have two roles in my ground .
in one of my roles , i work with the history of the anatomy .
i &apos;m a <unk> by training and what i study in this case is the way that people are <unk> the anatomy -- which is , of human bodies and <unk> , how they have considered the body fluids , the idea of the body ; what they &apos;ve thought about the body .
the other role that performance in my work is the activist , as a <unk> of patients or , as i say sometimes , <unk> infections of people who are medical patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people whose physical features challenging social norms .
i &apos;ve been working with , for example , with <unk> twins , two people inside one body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> -- much lower people than the average .
and i &apos;ve worked with many cases of people with sex , individuals whose physical <unk> don &apos;t fit into male and conventional female schemes .
in general lines , we can <unk> .
<unk> takes many forms .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex that doesn &apos;t get into the mainstream or female forms .
for example , there &apos;s the case of the individual based on <unk> <unk> whose gene from the y chromosome to the <unk> , which we all have in our lifetime , which <unk> .
and then , in life , the testes are doing testosterone .
but because this individual lacks testosterone receptors , the body does not react to the same .
it &apos;s <unk> &apos;s syndrome .
so , there &apos;s high levels of testosterone , but no reaction .
as a consequence , the body develops through a typically female course .
when the baby &apos;s born , the baby looks like a little girl .
he &apos;s a girl . he &apos;s raised as a girl .
and , often , it &apos;s not until puberty , when it &apos;s growing and developing breasts , but it doesn &apos;t have the <unk> period , when someone realizes something is happening .
then , after doing tests , they realize that instead of wearing jeans and uterus , they actually have testicles and a chromosome .
what &apos;s important to understand is that you can think it &apos;s a man , but actually it &apos;s not .
women , like men , we have in the body something called <unk> silk glands .
they &apos;re in the back of the body .
<unk> silk glands produce <unk> , the <unk> hormone .
most women like me -- i consider a typical woman ; she doesn &apos;t know her structure <unk> ; i think to be a typical woman , most women like me are sensitive to <unk> .
we produce <unk> and respond to <unk> .
as a consequence , someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who have the <unk> syndrome .
so sex is something complicated . it &apos;s not that <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum -- they can somehow be everywhere .
another example : a few years ago , i received a call from a 19 @-@ year @-@ old boy who was born and raised as a male child , and he had sex with her , and he had a life like a child , and he had just discovered that he had ovaries and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> .
he had black chromosomes and in the womb , the <unk> silk glands were so active that , essentially , created a male hormone environment .
as a consequence , his genital brain was exposed to the normal male hormone component .
he was born as a child . no one was <unk> .
and it was at 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> , when doctors discovered that , in fact , he was a woman inside .
well , another quick example of a <unk> case .
some people with 20th chromosomes develop what &apos;s known as <unk> , which is they have tissue embedded in <unk> tissue .
we don &apos;t know why that happens .
so , there are many varieties of sex .
the reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- for example , baby twins , <unk> , or <unk> , are sent to <unk> surgery , is not to be able to get rid of better physics .
in many cases , people are perfectly healthy .
the reason for various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories .
the system is typically based on the idea that a particular anatomy carries a particular identity .
we have the idea that being a woman is having female identity ; supposedly , being black means having african anatomy in historical terms .
a terribly simplistic idea .
and when we have a body that shows something quite different , we have problems with <unk> .
so we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk> .
our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
imagine how amazing it is to have kids that are born like two people in one body .
the recent highest case is last year with the south african @-@ american south african <unk> , and it was put into the fabric of his sex at the international berlin wall .
a lot of reporters called to ask , &quot; what &apos;s the test they &apos;re going to do to determine whether it &apos;s a man or a woman ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
in fact , we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t trace a <unk> line between men and women and men and <unk> and women and <unk> ; we are the ones who draw that line .
so , what we have is a situation where the longer we go through science , the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were stable trauma categories that were directly linked with stable categories are much more systematic than we thought .
and not only in terms of sex .
also , in terms of race , which is much more complicated than the terminology allows .
as we see , we go into a rough terrain .
let &apos;s look , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the dna with chimpanzees .
what about the fact that they disagree with them in just a few <unk> ?
and as we move into science , we get more and more into a uncomfortable zone in which we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that we probably have are too <unk> .
and we &apos;re looking at this in all human life .
one of them , for example , in our current culture , in the united states today , are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life .
it &apos;s hard to fix a moment from which a body becomes human and has a different rights to the fetus .
there are very systematic discussions today -- not in public , but in fact , within the <unk> of when someone is considered dead .
our ancestors never had to marry this question of whether someone was dead .
as a lot of them had a feather in front of his nose , and if he was still <unk> him .
if he stopped moving , he would stop him .
but we can , for example , extract vital organs from one body and put them into another body .
and , as a consequence , we have to deal with the dilemma of really determine somebody &apos;s death , and it puts us in a difficult situation where we don &apos;t have the simple categories of the past .
and you might think that this supernova explosion could lead someone like me .
in politics , i &apos;m progressive , people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit that i get nervous .
compare that these categories is a lot more <unk> than i thought i was tense .
<unk> from the standpoint of the concept of democracy .
and to tell you about this tension first , i have to admit that i &apos;m a <unk> of the founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were big .
i mean , they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did , which i find myself so much watching that <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; and not for music , which is totally <unk> .
it &apos;s why it happened in <unk> with the founding fathers .
founding fathers were , for me , the first activists of the anatomy and explain why .
what they practiced was a <unk> concept , and they matched it with another which was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years .
and , as you all remember , what <unk> our founding fathers was the idea of the monarchy , and the monarchy was a very simplistic concept of the anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world did not know the dna , but they had clearly the idea of the well @-@ being .
they had the concept of blue blood .
they were the idea that the political power was coming into the right of blood passed from the father and then the son and so on .
the founding fathers of that idea , and they started by a new <unk> concept , and that concept was that all men are created the same .
they <unk> the playing field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the anatomy . that was very , very radical .
and partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were being destroyed .
there was democracy and at the same time <unk> science .
and it &apos;s very clear , if you look at the history of founding fathers , that many of us were very interested in science and the idea of a naturalist .
they were getting tired of supernatural explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of supernatural power of being transmitted by a vague idea of birth .
they were moving towards a naturalist .
and if we look , for example , the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as a result , we were passing the idea of the <unk> match .
and , by doing so , they were <unk> the foundations of the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but they did it for us , and it was cool .
and what happened years later ?
it happened that women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the concept of the founding fathers of the coincidence was more important than the <unk> difference , and they said , &quot; the fact that we have a uterus and bar is not a significant enough difference to <unk> the right to the vote , the right to a full citizenship , the right to private property . &quot;
and the women were celebrated .
then came the success of the civil rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> , who said , &quot; isn &apos;t i a woman ? &quot;
we found men in the lines of civil rights movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of color that replace the <unk> coincidence of difference and , again , <unk> .
we see the same thing with the <unk> movement .
the problem is , of course , as we look at the coincidence , we have to start asking why we hold certain divisions .
but , attention , i want to keep some correlations in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t mean we should face the anatomy .
i don &apos;t mean that five @-@ year @-@ olds should be allowed to have sex or marry sex .
there are some divisions that make sense to me and that i believe we should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what they are , why keep them and if they make sense .
well , let &apos;s go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk .
we have two creatures , both of them in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , mary , was three months before time -- on june 1 of 1980 .
henry , on the contrary , he was born in the term : march 1 of 1980 .
by the only fact that he was born three months before mary <unk> all the rights three months before henry -- the right to sexual consent , the right to vote , the right to <unk> .
henry has to wait for all that not because he &apos;s a different kind of biological age , but he was born after .
we found other <unk> in relation to their rights .
henry , as opposed to being considered a man -- i haven &apos;t told you whether he &apos;s <unk> , by virtue of being considered man now , he is <unk> by the <unk> <unk> that mary does not have to worry .
mary , on his side , does not have the same rights to marriage that henry in all states , for example .
henry can get married in every state with a woman , but mary can marry a woman only in some states .
so , there are still physiological categories that are in many ways questionable and many ways .
and now the question is , what do we do now that the science of <unk> so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point where we have to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could come down ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes i feel like science gets away .
where are we going ?
it seems that what happens in our culture is sort of a pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
but a lot of people are trapped in a weird position .
for example , texas at some point has decided that to marry a man , you don &apos;t have to have y chromosome and get married a woman .
now , in practice , they don &apos;t do <unk> tests of people .
but this is also very strange , given the story that i told you about at the beginning of <unk> syndrome .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , in his &quot; i <unk> <unk> &quot; offers a solution .
it says that we should judge people &quot; based on not the color of their skin , but in the content of their character , &quot; going beyond the anatomy .
and i mean , &quot; yes , the idea looks really good . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do people judge the content of their character ?
i want to also point out that i &apos;m not sure that we need to be involved in this to deliver rights to people , because i have to admit that i know some of the clients who probably deserve more of the social services than some humans i know .
i also want to say that maybe some of the speakers i know can make more intelligent decisions and intelligent decisions about their sex relationships than 40 people i know .
so , how do you put the subject of character content ?
it &apos;s very difficult .
and a part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could in the future be measured by an instrument , maybe an mri .
do we really want to get to that point ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i do know is that it seems to be very important that the united states still has this current of thinking about democracy .
we &apos;ve done a good job in defense for democracy , and i think we &apos;re going to do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t live , for example , in a context like iranian where a man who is attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed , unless he &apos;s willing to have a sex shift , in which case he can live .
we &apos;re not in that situation .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have a context like a surgeon who i spoke with a couple of years ago that i had made birth worms to then separate them and <unk> their fame .
but when i was on the phone , i asked him the reason why the surgery was -- he was a very <unk> operation , he replied that in that other country , these kids would be very <unk> and therefore he had to .
i said , &quot; well , have you considered the political asylum rather than the surgical separation ? &quot;
america offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change by the well of the state .
so i think we have to be in our head .
well , in closing , i want to say that i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the dads .
and i want to think about what democracy would be like , or how it might have been , if we would have taken a lot higher engagement to the vitamins .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , which is that i think there can be different ideas coming from different backgrounds , especially if there are people thinking about group .
for years , since i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also been interested in finding out the sexual difference .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world .
and what we know about <unk> studies is that women , on average , not all , but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> inside the group .
and if we think about that , we have an interesting situation in our hands .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my advisers who knew that i was interested in feminism -- i considered myself a feminist -- as <unk> , he made me a weird argument .
&quot; tell me what a feminine of feminism is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; it &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism has got to do with getting rid of gender stereotypes , so there &apos;s no female in feminism . &quot;
but the more i &apos;ve thought about his question , the more i think there is something female in feminism .
i mean , there could be something , on average , something different between the feminine and male brain that makes us more <unk> to complex and willing to help the most vulnerable .
so , even though the founding were very attentive to come to find a way to protecting people in the state , it &apos;s possible that , if we were able to have been more <unk> to this concept , we would have probably enriched the concept of protection with the reciprocal support .
and maybe that &apos;s what we need to do in the future when we celebrate democracy beyond the anatomy : to think less about the individual body , in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
so as we try to create a more perfect union , let &apos;s think about what we do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my <unk> .
but before i show you what &apos;s inside , i &apos;m going to make a public confession , and that is , i &apos;m really obsessed with costumes .
i love to find , wear , and more recently , photograph and publish in my blog with bold , colorful and different costumes for every time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
all my clothes is second hand from <unk> markets and second @-@ hand shops .
oh , thank you .
the second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my wallet .
i get to know people <unk> ; usually my money goes to a good cause ; this looks unique ; and buying turns into my personal search for <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
do i love color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are positive , then i feel like i &apos;ve won .
going back to the theme of my <unk> , i want to tell you what i want to say for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what &apos;s next to someone who has all that clothes ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
i &apos;ve brought seven pairs of underwear , and nothing else .
underwear for exactly a week is all i &apos;ve put in my <unk> .
i thought it would be able to find everything else that i would like to use after i got here to palm springs .
and since they don &apos;t know me as the woman who walks for ted in underwear , that means i found some things .
and i &apos;d like to show you now the set for this week .
does it not sound interesting ?
while i do , i &apos;m also going to tell you some of the lessons of life , believe it or not , i &apos;ve learned in this adventure of not using new clothing .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking good .
you can almost always see you very much for less than 50 dollars .
the whole thing , the jacket , cost me 55 , and it &apos;s the most expensive thing i &apos;ve ever used in the week .
monday : color is energy .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be healthy , when you &apos;re wearing a bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to attract other happy people .
tuesday : integration is fixed .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk> .
i just know you .
if you get tired of the right people , you don &apos;t just understand you , you will get tired .
wednesday : get the kid inside .
sometimes people say to me , it seems to be a fish game , or i remind them of their little seven @-@ year @-@ old .
i like to tell you , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : trust is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good at something , it &apos;s almost safe you &apos;re .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good at something , it &apos;s probably also true .
my mother taught me this day after day .
but it wasn &apos;t until the age of 30 that i really understood his meaning .
and i &apos;m going to explain it in a few seconds .
if you think you &apos;re a beautiful person inside you and outside , there &apos;s no eyes you can &apos;t attract .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone in this audience .
we must be able to achieve everything we want to do .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth <unk> words for you : the gold <unk> go with it .
and finally , saturday : developing a self and only personal style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
i &apos;ve tried it over and over again , when people came up to me this week , just for what i was using , and we had fantastic conversations .
obviously , this is not going to go into my little <unk> .
so before i go home , to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate everything .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that you have to quit certain things .
i don &apos;t need to physically <unk> these things , because in the back of the corner , there will always be another suit , crazy and bright colorful , if there &apos;s a little love in my heart and i &apos;m looking .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good evening everybody .
i have something to show you .
think it &apos;s a <unk> , a flying <unk> .
in our lab , we call it responsive design .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about this .
if you look at this picture -- i &apos;m an italian origin , all the children in italy grew up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom , but the reason i show this is that something very interesting has happened in the careers of one in the last two decades .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a career in modest , you would take a budget and put it into a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the pilot were good enough , you would win the race .
but today , if you want to win a career , you need something like this too -- something that <unk> the car in real time , with thousands of sensors that deliver information and convey it to the system , and then use it to instructions it to the car and change things in real time as you distort information .
this is what , in engineering , the control system in real time .
it &apos;s essentially a system that has two components : a sensor and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is that real @-@ time control systems are starting to come into our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , have been covered with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re turning computers into the open air .
and , like that , they &apos;re starting to respond differently and they can be screened and different .
cities are big .
as a separate note , i wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet , but they represent 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and even 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
if we could do something with cities , it would be a big thing .
beyond cities , all these <unk> and <unk> are entering into our everyday objects .
this is an exhibition of <unk> for the late year at moma during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; cd to i. &quot;
well , our objects , our environment , begin to speak to us .
in a way , it &apos;s as if almost all of the existing atoms would become sensors and actuators .
and that &apos;s completely changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outside environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo .
you know , when michelangelo <unk> moses , it &apos;s said that in the end he took the hammer , and he threw it down in moses -- you can still see a little <unk> , and he says , &quot; <unk> , actually ? &quot;
well , today , for the first time , our environment begins to speak to us .
and i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples , insisting on the idea of capturing the environment and having something .
let &apos;s start with screening .
the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab .
this was four and a half years ago in italy .
what we did there was we used a new kind of network of that moment that had developed all over the world -- the <unk> phone network and <unk> information that was anonymous in that network that was somehow <unk> by the operator to understand how the city works .
it was a summer , hopefully 2006 .
it was the year in italy that he won the world cup .
maybe some of you remember him , he plays in italy and france , and at the end of the day he gave the <unk> .
and anyway , he won italy .
now , let &apos;s see what happened that day by looking at the <unk> activity in the network .
here we see the city .
you see the coliseum in the middle and the river <unk> .
it &apos;s morning , before play .
the time line is at the top .
early on , there are people over here and there doing calls , moving .
the game begins : silence .
<unk> from france . <unk> from italy .
<unk> ; people make a call fast and go to the bathroom .
second time . end of time .
first extra time , second .
<unk> , and at a moment , <unk> .
win in italy , yes !
that night , everyone went for the center .
there you see the great spike .
the next day , everyone was at the center of the team and the prime minister of the day .
and then the whole world went down .
you see the picture of the place called massimo circus , where , from roman time , people will celebrate , it &apos;s a great party , you can see the peak at the end of the day .
this is just an example of how we can now measure the pulse of the city in a way that we could not have done just a few years ago .
another quick example of detection : it &apos;s not about people , it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
today we know everything about the <unk> of our objects .
this is a map that shows all the chips that make a mac , how you assemble .
but we know very little about where things are going .
so in this project , we developed some little labels to track the garbage on its <unk> through the system .
we started with some volunteers who helped us in seattle a little more than a year ago , to tag what they were throwing -- different kinds of things , as you can see , things that were anyway .
then we put a little chip , a tag , to the garbage , and then we started to burn it .
these are the results from that .
from seattle .
after a week .
with this information , we realize that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same with much less energy .
this is data that didn &apos;t exist before .
they &apos;re happening complicated things , and there &apos;s a lot of unnecessary transportation .
but the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup we throw doesn &apos;t go away , which is still somewhere on the planet .
that if the plastic bottle that we throw one day is still there .
that if we show that to people , then we can promote some behavior change .
that was the reason for the project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could tell us much more about detection , and a lot of cool things we can do with that , but i wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning , which is to push it over the environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago at <unk> .
it all began with a question of the mayor of the city , who came and told us that spain and southern europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces , in architecture .
and the question was : how can technology , the new technology , join that ?
and one of the ideas that we developed at mit , in a workshop , was : imagine they have a <unk> and valves , valves , <unk> , open and close .
it creates like a curtain of water , with water pixels .
if the pixels can be written in them , show patterns , images , text .
and as you zoom in , the curtain will open so that we can pass , as you can see in the image .
we introduced this to <unk> mayor .
he liked it a lot .
and we set up a commission to design the building at the entrance to the <unk> .
we call it the digital highway .
the whole building is made of water .
there &apos;s no doors and no windows , but when you &apos;re approaching it , you can move .
the roof is also covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a little bit of wind , if you want to minimize the <unk> , the roof goes down .
or you can close the building and all architecture disappears , like in this case .
those days will always be someone , in the winter , when the ceiling comes down , someone who was there and said , &quot; let &apos;s get the building . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not that they have ignored it , but when it comes down to almost all of the architecture disappears .
here it is working .
you see the people <unk> for what &apos;s going on inside .
and here i am myself trying not to get wet by testing the sensors that open the water .
i think i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
that night was really even more fun .
all the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit .
it was no longer a building that would open to leave you , but it was a building that was still <unk> and holes of water , and you had to jump so you don &apos;t jump .
and for us that was very interesting because as architects , engineers , designers , we always think about the use that people will give our designs .
but then reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things to interact with , that people use .
this is an image of the building with the physical pixels , the <unk> of water , and of projections about them .
and this is what led us to thinking about the next project i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that those pixels could start flying .
imagine you could have little helicopter in the air and every one had a little <unk> that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space .
this is the video .
imagine a helicopter , like we saw earlier , that moves with others in sync .
we could form this cloud .
a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions .
or normal , but in three dimensions , where what changes is light , not the position of the pixels .
you can play it with a different type .
imagine that the display appears at different scales and sizes , different kinds of resolution .
and then all of that could be a <unk> cloud in 3d , which you can get near , and go through , and see from many different angles .
this is the real controlled <unk> , going down to form a v , like before .
when the lights go on , you see this . the same thing we saw before .
imagine each one of them being controlled by a person .
we can have every <unk> that comes from people , the movement of people , etc .
i want to show you something for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancer from today , the new york <unk> star and la jolla to capture his movements in 3d and use them as input to the <unk> .
here we can see <unk> dancing .
on the left , you see the pixels , the capture in different <unk> .
so , it &apos;s both 3d visualization in real time , like motion capture .
it can wash all the movement .
you can go all the way around .
and once we have the pixels , we can play with them , with color and movement , with gravity and rotation .
we want to use this as an entrance to the <unk> .
i wanted to show you the last project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something for the london olympics .
it &apos;s called &quot; the cloud . &quot;
and the idea is , imagine , again , that we could engage people in order to do something and change our nurturing environment like a <unk> , like a barn raising , but with a cloud .
imagine we could make everyone play a little bit for a <unk> .
and i think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that , in the last two decades , we go from the physical world to the digital world .
we &apos;ve digitized everything , as knowledge , and is accessible throughout the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world , the self @-@ organized power of networks , the physical world .
in our case , we might want to use it to design and make a symbol .
that would mean something built in a city .
but tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today : think of climate change or co2 emissions . how do we move from the digital world to the physical world ?
the idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made off the very same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and those particles are water , while in our cloud , they are pixels .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it has <unk> .
you can move inside , have different experiences .
you can see from the bottom , serve to share the main moments of the 2012 olympics and even further , and it can be used as a way of connection to the community .
so , it &apos;s both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can climb up , like a new top of london .
you can get in there .
as if he was a new digital <unk> at night , but most importantly , it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that humans are not separate from nature and everything is interconnected .
i was for the first time to antarctica , almost 10 years ago , and i saw my first <unk> .
i was amazed .
my heart pounding , i was <unk> , trying to understand what was ahead of me .
i <unk> them around me about the water -- almost 60 meters -- and i couldn &apos;t think it was a <unk> of snow about another <unk> of snow year after year .
<unk> are born when they get tired of glaciers or cut off the ice walls .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some of them refuse to give up and hold up to the end , while others cannot live longer and hold into a dramatic passion <unk> .
it &apos;s easy to think , when we see an iceberg , that they &apos;re isolated and , largely like we see us sometimes as humans .
but reality is the opposite .
as an iceberg melts , i &apos;m breathing your ancient atmosphere .
as an iceberg melts , it releases rich freshwater into minerals that feed lots of life .
so , i was close to photograph these <unk> as if it were the portraits of my ancestors , knowing that at these unique moments there is that way and will never exist again .
it &apos;s not death when it &apos;s broken ; it &apos;s not an end ; it &apos;s a continuation of his way through the life cycle .
some of the ice from the <unk> that we have is very young -- has a couple of thousand years .
and another part of the ice has over 100,000 years .
the last photos i &apos;d like to show you are from an iceberg that i photographed in <unk> , greenland .
it &apos;s kind of often getting a rolling iceberg .
here you have .
you can see on the left a little boat .
it &apos;s about five meters .
and i would like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its <unk> line .
you can see here , it starts rolling , the ship has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is an iceberg in greenland , average size .
it stands for about 120 feet or 40 meters .
this video is in real time .
and so <unk> , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
clearly , i &apos;ve been <unk> in life with many astonishing projects .
but the cool one i worked on was for this guy .
the guy is called <unk> .
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the &apos; 80s .
one day she came to her house after running , and she said , &quot; daddy , i feel a <unk> on my legs . &quot;
and that was the start of als .
today <unk> has a complete paralysis .
it can only use your eyes .
his work influenced me .
i have a design and animation company , so obviously , graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world .
so we decided we &apos;re going to be going to ask tony , <unk> , and his cause .
so i went in and met with his brother and his father and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give them this money .
what are you going to do with him ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i only want to be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and he &apos;s able to communicate with me . &quot;
and i said , &quot; a second , it &apos;s not that you &apos;ve seen stephen <unk> , isn &apos;t it that all of the people with paralysis can communicate through those devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re an important person and you have a very good insurance , you can &apos;t actually do it .
these devices are not affordable for people . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate then ? &quot;
anyone see the movie &quot; the <unk> and the butterfly ? &quot;
they communicate that way -- they &apos;re <unk> with their finger .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s <unk> . how can it be ? &quot;
so i came up with the only wish to give a check and instead i signed a check that i didn &apos;t have the least idea of how i was going to cover .
i get distracted by his brother and his father right there , right now , &quot; ok , this is the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to build a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s ridiculous that someone who has so much inside can &apos;t get it . &quot;
so i spoke at a conference a couple of months later .
i met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> lab , who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface , and then , with a laser pointer , they draw on that and register the negative space .
so they &apos;re going around doing art installations like this .
all the things that come up , they say , they &apos;re part of a life cycle .
they first start with sex organs , then with the bad words , then with bush attacks and , ultimately , people start doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home , and as i was dealing with my wife , i would tell him about this , and we said , &quot; if we know that there &apos;s the technology that allows you to use your eyes to control things , why we don &apos;t think a way we could control a laser to do graffiti again , it would be great . &quot;
and so the journey began .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of help things from side to side , we had achieved a couple of things .
one , we touch the doors of insurance companies and we got a machine so that we could communicate , a machine like stephen hawking &apos;s <unk> .
which was great .
and , seriously , it &apos;s all fun , and i call it <unk> , because when you talk to the guy , you get an e @-@ mail from him , and you say , &quot; i don &apos;t deserve it . this guy is fantastic . &quot;
the other thing we did was we brought seven programmers from all over the world -- all the <unk> from all the <unk> to our house .
my wife , kids and i , we moved into the garage of back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken over the house .
a lot of our friends thought we would do something completely stupid , and when <unk> would have taken away the frames of the walls and instead there would be graffiti .
but for two weeks , we went to the <unk> ride , my son was part , my dog was also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and you can see the description .
they &apos;re a pair of cheap sunglasses that we bought at the <unk> school of <unk> beach , some copper wire and stuff from home <unk> and radio shack .
we took a <unk> camera , we cut it , we put it on an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- and you build it yourself ; we published the software going down for free .
and we create a device that has no limitation at all .
there &apos;s no insurance company saying &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital i can say , &quot; no . &quot;
any person with paralysis today has access to draw and to communicate using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much . that was amazing .
so , at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
i love this picture because this is the other person &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room .
there was this whole <unk> and <unk> during the great opening .
and then over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , intense sessions , all night sessions , tony was drawing for the first time in seven years .
and this is a wonderful picture because this is the life support system , and he &apos;s looking through the life support system of his life .
we ran the bed so i could see .
and we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot outside the hospital .
and he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking .
the funny thing was , we had to sit in the parking lot , so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti too .
at the end of this he gave us an e @-@ mail and this was what he was saying to us , &quot; this was the first time i was drawing in seven years .
i felt like i would have been under the water and someone finally come up and grab me out there so i could breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that wonderful ?
in a way , that &apos;s our scream at war .
that &apos;s what keeps us moving , developing .
and we have a long way to go with this .
it &apos;s a cool device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of a <unk> screen .
someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and robust .
since then we &apos;ve had all kinds of recognition .
we &apos;ve won a lot of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making money out of this .
everything comes out of our own pockets .
the prizes were the guy , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> something about us , and then , december , time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 great inventions in 2010 , and it was really great .
the best of all of this -- and this is what ends about closing the <unk> -- is that , in april this year in the <unk> of los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; art in the streets . &quot;
and &quot; art in the streets &quot; is going to have the best urban <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , all of them are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be in the show , which is pretty impressive .
so , this is basically my idea : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
none of what &apos;s in this room was possible -- the stage , the computer , the microphone , the <unk> -- nothing could at some point .
make it possible -- anything in this room .
i &apos;m not a programmer , i never did anything with eye recognition technology ; i just recognized something and give me wonderful people to be able to make it happen .
and these are the questions that i want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel to be doing , if it &apos;s not now , when ? and if i &apos;m not me , who ?
thank you guys .
you know what i do is write for kids , and in fact , i &apos;m probably the author for kids , most read in america .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to look like a scientist .
i can claim it as a farmer , or with leather clothes , and no one has ever chosen a farmer .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and <unk> .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something that you fell somewhere .
you just have to go back to the apple to see it as an epiphany .
that &apos;s a picture of a circle .
a friend of mine did that -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of tricky circle i &apos;m going to talk to you .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s in the middle school , in <unk> , ohio where i was the freak of the class .
and i <unk> to bleed every week in the <unk> of kids , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me walk into the <unk> of the teachers &apos; room .
he made it secret .
for three years .
and i had to go out of town .
i had a thumb , and 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- i found a lover -- and in the &apos; 80s , i felt the need to start work in organizations that were fighting aids .
about three or four years ago , in the middle of the night i got a phone call from that teacher , the <unk> lady who said , &quot; i need to see you .
i &apos;m adults that we never get to know .
you could go to ohio , and please bring that man that i know you &apos;ve already found .
and i have to tell you that i have pancreatic cancer , and i would like you to engage with this for please . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we went to see it , we laugh , we cry , and we realized that she needed to be abused .
we found a place , we <unk> it , and we <unk> it and we charge it for her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and just like the woman who wanted to wake up as a grown @-@ up , she became a <unk> box and was put in my hands .
and what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that i talked to you about was made in itself .
epiphany is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , my partner and i save her from her .
and you know that part of life needs everything the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m very happy that we &apos;ve talked a lot about this today .
it also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our work to provide those things .
thank you .
imagine a huge explosion when you &apos;re at 900 feet tall .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor doing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it sounds scary .
well , i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in the <unk> .
it was the only one who could talk to the flying assistants .
so i immediately looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem . there probably are some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already cracked the plane , and we weren &apos;t so far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the plane hit the plane with the hudson river .
usually that &apos;s not the route .
it will accelerate the motors .
imagine being on an airplane and without noise .
and then he said three words -- the three most <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he said , &quot; <unk> for the impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more about the flying assistant .
i could see him in his eyes , it was terror . life is over .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about myself that day .
i learned that everything changes in a minute .
we have this list of things to do before we die , these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to get and didn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to fix , all the experiences that i &apos;ve wanted to have and never had .
as i was thinking about that later , i came a phrase , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m going to open it up .
i don &apos;t want to spend anything in life .
and that urgency , that purpose , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is when i hit the bridge george washington , which was not for much -- i thought about , wow , i really feel a big deal .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
in my humanity and my mistakes , i have tried to improve on everything i did .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego .
and i &apos;m sorry for the time that i &apos;m focused on things that i didn &apos;t mean by people who do care .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with the people .
and then , as i went through that , i discovered the negative energy of my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
in two years , i haven &apos;t had a fight with my wife .
it feels like wonders .
i &apos;m no longer trying to be right ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you see the water coming .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please fly . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this to break into 20 pieces , like you see in those documentaries .
and as i breathed down , i had the feeling of , wow , dying is not fear .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been working for it all of our life .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness is in a single thought , which is , i just wish one thing .
i wish i could see my kids grow up .
a month later , i was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade , not much artistic talent .
... still .
and i scream , <unk> , like a little girl .
and for me , that was the whole reason that it was in the world .
at that point i understood , by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent .
above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good parent .
i was given a miracle , not dying that day .
and i was given another gift , which was the possibility of looking back into the future and living differently .
you &apos;re flying today , the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens to you on your plane -- and please not be -- but imagine , how would it change ?
what would you do , which you still expect to do , because you think you &apos;re going to live forever ?
how would it change their relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and most importantly , are the best parents who can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the computer worm is actually very simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the nuclear bomb .
its greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the uranium <unk> plant .
the gray boxes that you see are real @-@ time control systems .
if we manage to compromise these systems that control speeds and valves , we can cause a lot of problems with a centrifuge .
the gray boxes don &apos;t use windows software ; they &apos;re from a completely different technology .
but if we can actually put a windows virus in a portable computer that was used by an engineer to set up this gray box , then we &apos;re ready .
this is the behind <unk> .
we started with a windows <unk> .
the <unk> enters the gray box , damages the centrifuge , and the iranian program is <unk> ; it &apos;s <unk> mission .
it &apos;s easy , huh ?
i want to tell you how we discover this .
when we started doing research on <unk> six months ago , the purpose was completely unknown .
the only thing that was known is that it &apos;s very , very complex in the part of windows : the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities of the day @-@ to @-@ zero .
it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these control systems .
so that really caught our attention , and we started an experiment where we were <unk> our surroundings with <unk> , and we saw what was going on with this .
so , very strange things happened .
they dressed up like a laboratory rat that they didn &apos;t like our cheese : they smell it , but they didn &apos;t want to eat .
it didn &apos;t make sense for me .
and after experiencing different cheese flavors , i realized , and i thought , &quot; this is a run .
it &apos;s completely run . &quot;
the <unk> is looking actively in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration , and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working at that location .
if not , <unk> does nothing .
so that called my attention , and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day , because i thought , &quot; we don &apos;t know what the goal is . &quot;
it could be , say , for example , an american energy plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
better than the goal .
so we pulled out and pulled the code of attack , and we found that it was structured in two digital bombs : a small one and a big one .
we also found that they were armed very professionally by people who obviously had all the information inside .
they knew all the points for attacking .
you probably even know how much the operator is .
so , you know everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that <unk> is complex and high tech , let me tell you , the payload is very complex .
it &apos;s very much above all we &apos;ve seen before .
here you see a sample of this attack code .
we &apos;re talking about about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like the old <unk> language .
i want to tell you how we could find this code .
what we were looking at at at the beginning were called functions of the system , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and trying to link them to the real world , with potential goals in the real world .
we need theories about what we can pass or <unk> .
to get to theories about goals , we remember that it &apos;s definitely a violent <unk> , it has to be a valuable white , and it &apos;s probably located in iran , because that &apos;s where most of the infections has been <unk> .
there are not many thousands of goals in that area .
it basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; get a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants amongst our clients . &quot;
i called them up , and i went to them in an effort to prove their experience with what we found in code and data .
and it worked pretty well .
so we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of rotor .
rotating is that cell phone inside the centrifuge , that black object you see .
if you hold the speed of this rotating , you can actually recognize it and even make it <unk> .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and slow down in an obvious effort to go nuts to the nest engineers , so they couldn &apos;t really resolve this very quickly .
we &apos;re trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and structure .
so , for instance , the number <unk> out in that code , you can &apos;t get away .
i started doing science literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and i found that they &apos;re <unk> in what a waterfall is called , and every waterfall is <unk> .
that made sense , there was a coincidence .
and he got better yet .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 stages .
and guess what do we find in attacking ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a good coincidence .
this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands .
so there was no <unk> . it wasn &apos;t .
the results have been collected after several weeks of hard work .
we had to go regularly without the ends , and we had to start again .
yet , we found that both digital <unk> attached to one single , same goal , but from different angles .
the little <unk> is taking a waterfall , and spinning these rotors and spins them down , and the big <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating valves .
in addition , we &apos;re very confident that we have determined what the recipient is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
we don &apos;t have to worry about other goals being driven by <unk> .
here i show you some very interesting things that we saw , i really got scared .
there &apos;s the gray box , and the top you see the <unk> .
so what this thing does is he <unk> the input values from sensors , for example , of the pressure sensors and vibration sensors and legitimate code , which is still running during the attack , with fake input data .
and believe it or not , these fake input data is <unk> by <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of like in the hollywood movies where , during the theft , the safe video chamber feeds on <unk> video .
it &apos;s cool , huh ?
the idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the room of control .
it &apos;s actually much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to <unk> a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast .
for example , in a power plant , when the big steam steam turbine comes up at a speed , you have to open escape valves in a millisecond .
obviously , this cannot do a human operator .
that &apos;s where we need digital security systems .
and when they &apos;re engaged , then they can do bad things .
the plant can burst .
and you don &apos;t even <unk> the security system , you &apos;ll notice .
that scares him .
but it can be worse .
what i &apos;m going to say is very important .
think about this . this is a generic attack .
it has nothing to do with , specifically , <unk> , with uranium <unk> .
it could also work , for example , in a power plant , or a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to disseminate this burden with a usb key , as we saw in the <unk> case .
you could also use conventional worm technology for <unk> .
we &apos;re going to experience the most possible .
and if you do that , what you do is , with a <unk> of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to confront .
unfortunately , the greatest number of goals for such attacks is not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states and japan .
all the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals .
we have to deal with the consequences , and we better start preparing us now .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s gotten public in many ways that people assume that <unk> is the primary entity behind this .
what &apos;s your opinion ?
ralph <unk> : okay , you really want to hear this ?
yes . okay .
my view is that the <unk> is involved , but the engine is not israel .
the engine behind this is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s one , and that &apos;s the united states , fortunately , .
because otherwise , our problems would be even bigger .
thank you for <unk> . thank you , ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years holding them into situations generally very difficult and at the same time a little bit dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i shot in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating only this -- fun at first , which is difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance , with the only purpose of <unk> to look at social issues in ways that are appealing , interesting , and hopefully analyzing them in a way that stands and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a tedtalk on the world of brands and <unk> , i wanted to do something a little different .
so , some of you may have heard it , or not , a couple of weeks ago , i took a ride on ebay .
i emailed some messages on facebook , some on twitter , i offered the rights of my tedtalk name in 2011 .
so , some fortunate , a corporation , a nonprofit , was going to have the unique opportunity in life <unk> chris anderson -- that chris anderson is not going to allow him to buy the rights of the talk that you &apos;re seeing right now that chris had no title and didn &apos;t really have a lot of content to explain what the subject would be .
what was the following thing : &quot; here , <unk> name shows : my tedtalk that you have no idea what it &apos;s all about and content could be buried in the face , especially if i put it ridiculous to you or your company to do it .
but in fact , this is a very good media opportunity . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
it &apos;s a title of progress , by the way .
so even with that <unk> , i knew that someone was going to buy the rights of the name .
if you had asked me a year ago , i could not have been able to make sure .
but in the new film that i &apos;m working on , we examined the world of marketing , of advertising .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;ve been in horrible situations in the last few years , but nothing could make me , nothing could work for me , so difficult or as dangerous as i could walk into the halls with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
i want to make a film that is about the product <unk> and marketing and advertising , and the whole film is all about products and marketing and advertising .
the movie is going to be called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what happens in &quot; the larger film you would never know , &quot; is that everything from the top down , in principle , has <unk> images , all the time , from the <unk> that appears before the title , the x @-@ ray .
now this brand , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center .
these people will join the film by <unk> -- forever .
and so the film explores all this idea . is it what ? a <unk> , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> .
it was more emphasis .
it was &quot; a <unk> . forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the x @-@ marks on the title , but we &apos;re going to make sure we all the categories we can in the film .
maybe you &apos;ll get a shoe and you get the coolest shoe that you &apos;ve used ...
the biggest car you &apos;ve ever offered in &quot; the bigger film &quot; the <unk> film , &quot; the best drink you &apos;ve ever had , &quot; the great <unk> &quot; movie .
the idea is then to show the marks as part of life , make them play the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole process in this movie .
that &apos;s the whole idea , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love you to help make it happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny because it &apos;s the first time i hear that ; it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
however , i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t know if &quot; an angle &quot; is too stubborn , but you know how it &apos;s going to crash ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
a million and a half .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to engage with them , but it &apos;s certainly going to be worth sending a couple of big brands .
who knows , maybe for the moment the movie comes out , let &apos;s see us as a whole bunch of prescription idiots .
what do you think is going to be the answer ?
most of the answers will be &quot; no . &quot;
but will it be hard to sell , by the film or for me ?
jk : both .
it means you &apos;re not very optimistic .
so , do you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
all right .
amazing .
we have to think about what brands .
yes .
when you look at the people you have to treat .
we have some places to go .
he turns the camera .
i thought , &quot; <unk> the camera &quot; meant we have a conversation outside of a mic .
the camera says , &quot; we don &apos;t want to know anything about your movie . &quot;
and so , one by one , all these companies suddenly disappeared .
none wanted to have anything to do with this movie .
i was shocked .
they didn &apos;t want to know anything about this project .
and i was very impressed , i thought the concept of advertising , was to give the product to as many people as possible , to tell them that so many people watched it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this intersection of new media and old media and the media landscape , right now , is it not the idea to have that new vehicle worthy of attention that &apos;s going to lead the message to the masses ?
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had a <unk> error , and that error was this .
actually , no , there was no error .
there was no mistake at all .
this would have been fine .
but the problem was what this image represents .
see , when you look for images of transparency in google , this is one of the first images that came up .
i like your way to roll , sergey brin . no .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or seen , easily understandable -- that &apos;s characterized by the visibility or <unk> of information , especially in business practices -- being the last line maybe the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency in these days .
our politicians name it , the ceo named <unk> , even the ceos name it .
but all of a sudden when it comes to making a reality , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is afraid -- like that weird bear that &apos;s still <unk> .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this weird road .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> .
that &apos;s very risky .
when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to build a story .
we want us to make a story short , but we want us to <unk> our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father would lie to a lie -- and there he is looking at me as he used to say , &quot; son , there are three sides in every story .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
as you see , in this film , we wanted to tell the actual story .
but with just a company , an agency wants to help me -- and that only because i knew john bond and richard <unk> of many years -- i realized i would have to go for me , i would have to go out into the middle @-@ middle @-@ aged and go to the companies myself with my whole team .
so , what i began to warn you of all of a sudden -- and i started giving <unk> -- is that when you start talking to corporations , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends who make large films , huge , huge , giant films and others who make small films , independent films like mine .
and my friends who make great hollywood movies , giant hollywood movies say the reason their movies are so successful is because of the associated brands that they have .
and then my friends who make independent films say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant movies in hollywood ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
how are we going to see specifically to ban it in the movie ?
every time i &apos;m about to go out , every time i open my <unk> , you &apos;ll see the ban .
any time for an interview with someone , i can say , &quot; are you good at this interview ?
are you ready ? you get a little nervous .
i want to help you out .
maybe you should get a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
and there was one of these fabulous <unk> .
both &quot; floral fusion &quot; as &quot; <unk> of paradise &quot; are going to have its opportunity .
we &apos;re going to have as much for men as a woman , solid , <unk> , in bar , whatever .
that &apos;s the general look .
now i can answer your questions and give you a glimpse .
we &apos;re a small brand .
similar to the kind of smaller movies that we have ; we &apos;re much more of a competing brand .
so we don &apos;t have the budget that has other marks .
so , to do things like this , you know , to remind people of this is why we &apos;re interested in this .
what words would they use to describe to ban it ?
ban is in white .
that &apos;s a big question .
top technology .
technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put into the <unk> .
we talk about something audacious , fresh .
i think &quot; cool &quot; is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus &quot; battle and sweat . &quot;
it keeps you cool .
how do we keep you quiet ? with better , more freshness , three times cooler .
things like those that <unk> the benefits .
and that &apos;s a <unk> company .
what about me ? what about a common type ?
i need to talk to the man in the street , to the people like me , to the common <unk> .
they have to talk to me about my brand .
how do you define your brand ?
hmm .
i don &apos;t know .
i like good clothes .
female : revive the &apos; 80s , &apos; <unk> &apos; unless it &apos;s <unk> day .
okay , so what &apos;s the <unk> brand ?
something unique .
i guess the kind of gender , the style that i have would be like a dark glamour .
i like dark colors , lots of gray and things like that .
usually i have <unk> like sunglasses , or i like crystals and similar .
if dan was a brand , he could be a classic <unk> , mercedes benz .
the brand i am , i would call it casual flight .
woman # 2 : in a part of a hippie , in part of &apos; girl brooklyn , i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the type of pets .
i sell pet toys in the country and in the world .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my little sector , that &apos;s my brand .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because he <unk> <unk> .
man 5 : brand @-@ <unk> writer .
is that something ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a firm .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be tom , but i often get into the intersection of dark glamour and casual flight .
i realized i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could come into my head , someone who could help me understand what they call the &quot; brand personality . &quot;
and i found a company called mao olson in pittsburgh .
they helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , to discover that brand personality .
if they could do it for them , they could surely do it for me .
they were taking the photos , right ?
yes . the first photo is a familiar photo .
tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to being .
these guys shape my way of looking at the world .
tell me about that world .
that world ? i think your world is the world you live in -- like the people around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the work you do .
all of these things come from and they start in a place and in my case they all come and start in my family , in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next is &quot; this is the best day of my life . &quot;
how does this relate to your thoughts , feelings and your way to be ?
it &apos;s like who would like to be me .
i like different things .
i like weird stuff . i like weird stuff .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; -- what &apos;s good for us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what phase of <unk> do you find now ?
why is it important to <unk> ? what &apos;s red ?
tell me a little bit about that .
a little more about you , which is not who you are .
what else have you had ?
you don &apos;t have to fear . what kind of rollercoaster you are ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yes . very good .
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of this .
there was a lot of crazy about this .
the first thing i saw was this idea that there are two different sides , but margins , in your brand personality , morgan <unk> , is a very conscious brand .
they were getting really good together .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox in them .
and i think some companies will only focus on one of their strong points or another rather than focusing on both .
many companies tend to -- and it &apos;s nature -- to avoid the things that are not safe ; they prevent fear , those elements , and you actually give them to sink and make something positive to you , and it &apos;s nice to see that .
what other brands are like this ?
the first here is the classic , apple .
and you can also see here at <unk> , wii , mini , which is really <unk> and <unk> .
now there are <unk> and conscious brands , these things that have gone and come , but a playful conscious brand is something very powerful .
a playful conscious brand . what is your brand ?
if someone asks you to understand your brand identity , your brand personality , what would it be ?
are you a ascending asset ? are you somebody who makes blood flow ?
or are you a lower asset ?
a little bit quieter , special , conservative ?
the further attributes are like being playful , being kind of like the port @-@ au @-@ prince , contemporary , <unk> , or audacious as <unk> <unk> , or quickly , or <unk> , dominant , magic or mystic as <unk> .
or are you much more biased ?
are you conscious , sophisticated as <unk> ?
are you established , traditional provider , protector ? you &apos;re having oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , familiar , trustworthy , confident , sacred , <unk> or wise , like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of this movie , we had over 500 companies , climbing and <unk> , saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want to be part of this project .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film , mainly because they wouldn &apos;t have control , they wouldn &apos;t have control over the end product .
but we got 17 marketing partners who were willing to give up that control that they wanted to be in the business with someone who was aware and playful like me , and that , ultimately , we were empowered to tell stories that we would usually not have been able to tell stories after a <unk> would usually never go .
we were allowed to tell the story of <unk> , and we came to tell the story in this movie of how they now use mri to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing like film .
we went to são paulo where advertising has been banned .
throughout the city for the last five years , there &apos;s no fences , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s nothing .
and we went to school districts where businesses are on their way into schools with u.s. money supply problems .
the amazing thing for me is that the projects that i &apos;ve had the biggest answer , or where i &apos;ve been most successful are the ones that i &apos;ve been focusing on .
and that &apos;s what these marks did .
they took the <unk> , they took their agencies , and they said maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to try directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to make people think , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world .
and how has it gone ? is it successful ?
well , ever since the movie was sent into the <unk> festival , let &apos;s take a look .
as the movie came out in january , and since then -- and this is not <unk> -- we &apos;ve had 900 million impressions in the media for this film .
this is just a two and a half @-@ week period .
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no tv .
the movie is still <unk> .
it &apos;s not yet online . it &apos;s not <unk> .
it hasn &apos;t even presented in other countries yet .
ultimately , this film has already begun to gain momentum .
and it &apos;s not bad because almost all of the agencies that we talk to their clients is not to be part .
i &apos;ve always believed that if you risk them , if you take risks , that in those risks there are opportunities .
i think when you get people out of that , you &apos;re pushing them into failure .
i think when you train your employees in risk aversion , they &apos;re preparing their whole company to reward them for rewards .
i feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to risk .
we have to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that can be missed .
ultimately , let &apos;s move forward , i think we have to give it to fear .
we have to put that bear in a cage .
we numb fear . we <unk> risk .
from a <unk> to a time , we have to embrace the risk .
and ultimately , we have to go for transparency .
more than just a little bit of honesty , it &apos;s going to go a long way .
and by saying this , with honesty and transparency , all my talk &quot; <unk> the <unk> &quot; has been introduced by my good friends of mine who for dollars were buying the rights of the name on ebay .
turning big data into big opportunities for companies around the world .
<unk> presents &quot; <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
thank you very much .
so , morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened with those dollars growing ?
it &apos;s a fantastic question .
in my pocket , i have a check to call from the ted matrix , which is the mtn foundation , which is a check for dollars to be applied to my assistance for ted next year .
my name is <unk> .
and 18 months ago , i was doing another job in google , until i launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss , who &apos;s here and let me do it .
it took me 18 months and 18 months .
many negotiations and stories , i assure you , with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did it .
i think my own story is simply explains this slide , and this is access .
i grew up in india .
joy of a great education -- i didn &apos;t have access to many of these museums and works of art .
so , when i started traveling and going to museums , i started learning a lot .
and working on google , i try to make the wish to make it more accessible by technology .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing it .
better than this demo , i &apos;ll then tell you a couple of interesting things that we &apos;ve done from his launch .
so , just simply : we &apos;re going to try it .
look around all the museums there .
there &apos;s the <unk> gallery , moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i &apos;m actually going to go into one of my favorites , the <unk> , the new york art museum .
there are two ways of doing that -- very simple .
we click , and , bam ! we &apos;re already in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are , bombay <unk> , that doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around and you have fun .
do you want to browse through the museum ?
we open the plan up , and with one click , we jump inside .
they &apos;re inside , you want to go to the end of the hall .
keep on going . <unk> !
explore .
thank you , but i haven &apos;t reached the best .
now , i &apos;m standing in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the <unk> &quot; by pieter <unk> .
i see the management sign .
if the museum shows us the picture , we click there .
look , this is one of the images .
here &apos;s all the data from metadata .
for those of you who are really interested in art , you can click there , but i &apos;m going to click here right now .
and this is one of the images that we &apos;ve captured in what we call <unk> technology .
so this image , for example , contains , i think , about 10,000 million pixels .
and there are a lot of people who ask me , &quot; and what do you get from 10,000 million pixels ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels .
it can zoom in a very simple way .
you see fun things that are happening .
i love this kid ; his expression doesn &apos;t have a price .
but if you really go into a deep dive .
so i started playing , and i found something that was happening there .
and i said , &quot; wait a minute , this looks interesting . &quot;
i went in and discovered that kids were actually playing something .
i did a little research , i talked to some people from the <unk> , and i actually found that this is a game called &#91; unclear &#93; , which is about hitting a stick with a stick on the front tuesday .
and it seemed very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they were doing it , but i &apos;ve learned something about it .
and now we &apos;re going to get even further down , and you &apos;ll see that you can actually even get to the cracks .
now just to give you a little bit of perspective , i &apos;m going to take the picture away , so you really see what &apos;s there .
this is where we were , and this is painting .
the best thing is to come , a second .
so now we &apos;re going to fast jump again to moma in new york .
here &apos;s another favorite of mine , &quot; the night <unk> . &quot;
the example i showed was to find details .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
it increases and really accomplish it .
i go to one of my favorite parts in this picture , and i &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
this is &quot; <unk> night , &quot; i think i had never seen it before .
i &apos;m going to show you another one of my favorite features .
there &apos;s a lot more stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time to go .
this is the really cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
all of you , absolutely everyone , doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich or poor , or if you have a mansion , that doesn &apos;t matter .
you can online create your own museum , create your own collection from all these pictures .
it &apos;s very simple ; we come in -- i &apos;ve created this function that i call &quot; the power of zooming , &quot; -- we &apos;ve just made a zoom in .
this is &quot; the ambassadors &quot; at the national gallery in london .
you can write things down , send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you contemplate these masterpieces .
so in conclusion , i think , the main thing for me is that all amazing things really don &apos;t come from google .
no , in my opinion , they don &apos;t even come from museums .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say this .
actually , they come from those artists .
and that &apos;s been my humble experience with this .
i mean , i hope that in this digital medium , it makes justice for its artwork and it &apos;s properly represented .
and the big question that makes me today is , &quot; have you made this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s for supplement the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts .
the left side , which is the logical part , and the right side , which is the intuitive part .
so , if we scale a scale to measure the fitness of every hemisphere , we could design a plan of our brain .
for example , this would be someone who is completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s totally intuitive .
so , where do you measure your brain on this scale ?
some <unk> for one of these extreme ends , but i think , for most of the members of this audience , his brain is something like this -- with a huge fitness in both of them <unk> at the same time .
it &apos;s not that they are mutually exclusive .
you can be logical and intuitive .
i consider one of those people , which , like most other experimental physicists , we need quite a lot of logic to keep these complicated ideas .
but at the same time , we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we like to play with things .
we start to play with them , and then we see them react , and then we develop our intuition from that point .
and actually , you do the same thing .
some intuition that you may have developed over the years is what it says that one thing can only be in a place at a time .
i mean , it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , they developed it .
i remember looking at a kid playing in a parking lot .
he was a little kid , and he didn &apos;t do very well , he would always fall .
but i bet the game with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson , and that is that big things don &apos;t allow the <unk> to stay , and stay in a place .
this is a big conceptual model that you can have from the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with parking bars , they play with these strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , they discover that they do all sorts of really strange things -- like they can go across walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
at that point , physics was found a few years ago ; we needed quantum mechanics to describe these little particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the big objects around us every day .
that doesn &apos;t get really good at my intuition , and maybe that &apos;s because i don &apos;t play very often with particles .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very much .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody saw a particle .
but they don &apos;t quite get into my logical part .
because if it &apos;s all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t find the reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
and therefore i would feel much better if i could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics .
that &apos;s why a few years ago , i set out to do exactly that .
and i did .
this is the first object that you can see that it &apos;s been in a matching of quantum mechanics .
what we see here is a little computer chip .
and you can try to see the green dot right in the middle .
that &apos;s the little bit of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
this is a picture of the object .
and here i &apos;m going to zoom in a little bit . it &apos;s right in the middle .
and then here we do a very big approach to the little metal <unk> .
what we see is a little bit of metal , with a trampoline , and it comes together on a platform .
and so i did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with a silicon chip , and i started running all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last material , i had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the form of a swimming <unk> underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap , but it needs a little help .
let me make an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people .
i mean , when i &apos;m in an elevator only , i do all sorts of weird things , but then when other people go up and do those things , because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or , actually , frightening .
quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way .
the travel mates of inanimate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes up and the heat of the room .
so we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics , we would have to withdraw to all the other passengers .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we <unk> the lights , then we introduced a hoover and we pulled all the air out , and then we cool it down to a lower temperature of a degree above zero .
now , being just in the elevator , the little piece of metal is free to act like .
so we measured their movements .
we found it moving into very strange forms .
instead of staying perfectly still , i was vibrating , and the way i claim it was a breath like this -- like a <unk> that expands and contract .
and by giving him a smooth push , we were able to make it float , and that we didn &apos;t heal at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is really fantastic .
what does it mean that something <unk> and doesn &apos;t happen at the same time ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
in one case , all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still , and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
it &apos;s only in certain directions when those are dancing .
in the rest of the time , they &apos;re <unk> .
it means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
i think this is cool .
really .
it was worth living in a clean room to do this for all those years , because , look at this , the difference on scale between one atom and that little metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , and that piece of metal can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you too ?
i mean , it &apos;s my logical part that he talks .
so imagine if you were in various places at the same time , what would that be ?
how would you affect your consciousness if your body was embedded in space ?
there &apos;s another part of the story .
and that &apos;s when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and we look inside the box , and we saw that the metal is still in one piece .
and i could get to this new intuition , apparently all the objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected .
well , that &apos;s not so true .
it &apos;s more than that . it &apos;s deeper .
it is that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work , they have the possibility of choice between at least a bunch of different cities that are competing to engage new residents .
well , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have a single city willing to describe them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re worth much more than their construction cost .
so we could easily <unk> the world tens , perhaps hundreds of new cities .
well , this may sound crazy if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but they &apos;re just going to run through apartment buildings .
imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already <unk> , and yet half of them were still waiting to get there .
you could try to increase the capacity by making all the buildings out there .
but you know the problem that <unk> is that these buildings and the areas around them have rules to avoid the discomfort and the cooperation of the building .
so it would be very difficult to do all those kinds of <unk> .
but they could go to a whole new place , build a whole new apartment building , always , and when the rules of that place would build the construction rather than putting it in .
so i proposed that governments will bring new area of reform to hold cities and give them a name : cities under charter .
later , i learned that more or less at the same time , <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of honduras reform .
they knew that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in honduras .
and at some point , <unk> said to <unk> , &quot; what would happen if we were to take <unk> land , and we just gave them an embassy <unk> a little bit to the u.s. embassy , and then , if people want to go and work under the rules of canada or the united states rules , it can go to work in the united states .
in the summer of 2009 , he went through a constitutional crisis .
in the next regular election , wolf has signed with a platform where we <unk> reforms and at the same time in reconciliation .
he asked <unk> to be his boss &apos; boss .
meanwhile , i was preparing for a talk at tedglobal .
through a process of <unk> , trial and error and a tremendous amount of user testing , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their most essential ideas .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you cannot go and upset all of the skyline of apartments .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but we need so much of technologies and rules to make progress , and usually it &apos;s the rules that keep us going .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent a link to the tedtalk .
he showed it to <unk> .
they called me .
they said , &quot; we will inspire this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so , in december , we came together in miami , in a conference room of a hotel .
i tried to tell you this point about how valuable cities are , much more valuable than their monetary cost .
and i used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like new york , notice , land that , in some cases , is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , and at some point , when there was a pause , he said , &quot; paul , maybe we could see the video from the tedtalk . &quot;
and the talk described in very simple terms that a city under a charter is a place where you start with <unk> territory , a charter that specifies all the rules that overlap there and a choice so that people can choose whether or not they want to live under those rules .
so the president of honduras called me , and he told me that we had to do this project , this is important , this could be the way for our country to advance .
he asked me to go out and talk again about four and five of january .
so i presented another talk full of data , which included an image like this , which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city , this has to be very big .
this is a picture of denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in denver .
this airport only covers over 100 square kilometers .
so i was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city , you have to start with a site that would build at least a thousand square kilometers .
that &apos;s over 100,000 acres .
everyone <unk> writes a lot .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attentive .
the head of congress came up to the platform and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could see the video from the tedtalk .
i have it here on my computer . &quot;
so i sat down and they showed the tedtalk .
and this explained the essential thing ; a new city can offer new choices for people .
there would be a option in a city that you might be in honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away to the north .
and we also need new choices for leaders .
because the leaders of the kenyan government would need help from partners , could benefit from the partners that would help them to establish and fulfill the rules of the charter , so that everyone could trust that the charter could actually play .
and what president wolf thought was that that a guarantee that i was considering as a way of engaging the foreign investors in order to make sure that the city could be just as important for all the parties in honduras for so many years for fear and mistrust .
we went and saw a website .
this photo is over there .
it could easily cover a few thousand square kilometers .
and shortly afterwards , on the 19th of january , they voted in congress to <unk> their constitution , and add a constitutional that would allow us to create these special development regions .
in a country that had just passed through this painful crisis , the voting in congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was one .
all parties , all the factions in society , the <unk> .
to get you in the constitution , you have to pass twice in congress .
february 17 was approved again in another voting , from <unk> to one another .
immediately after the vote , of the 21st to the 24 of february , a 30 @-@ year shifting delegation was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities .
one of them is south korea .
this is a picture of a new city center that is being built in south korea ; it &apos;s bigger than the center of boston .
everything that you see there was built in four years , after four years went by getting permission .
the other interested country in city building is singapore .
in fact , they &apos;ve already built two cities in china and are preparing for a third .
and if you think about this in a practical way , this is the point where we are .
they have a website , and they &apos;re already thinking about a place for the second city .
they &apos;re setting up a legal system that would allow the administrators to come up , and at the same time to operate under an external legal system .
a country has already committed to allowing its supreme court to be the ultimate court for this new criminal system .
there are <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project .
they can even get some funding .
but the only thing we know that they &apos;ve already solved is they have a good number of inhabitants .
there are a lot of companies that want to break into the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to go there .
in the world , there are 700 million people who say they would like to be changed immediately to another place .
there &apos;s a million a year out of latin america to go to the united states .
many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go get a job ; sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , in a decade .
so , what do you think about building a new city in honduras ?
or build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these around the world ?
what do you think you &apos;re going to stop that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends urged me to say , &quot; thank you ted . &quot;
do you know how many decisions do you make a day ?
do you know how much we choose in a week ?
recently , i did a poll over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says choose an average american , is about 70 a day .
not so long ago , in research , they continued for a week to a group of game presidents .
researchers registered the different tasks by these ceos and the time they spent on making decisions related to those tasks .
they found that , on average , they found <unk> jobs a week .
of course , every single job included a lot of <unk> .
half of those decisions took nine minutes or less .
only 12 percent rush hour or over time .
now think about your choices .
do you know how many of them belong to the age of nine minutes , and how many of an hour ?
how do you deal with the way those choices are ?
i want to talk to you today about one of the biggest problems with choice .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
while i &apos;m talking about this , i &apos;m going to ask you a few questions , and i need to know your answers .
when i ask a question , as i &apos;m blind , raise your hand only if you want to burn calories .
otherwise , when i ask a question , if your answer is positive , please give you a <unk> .
and now my first question of the day : are you ready to hear about the problem of choice ?
thank you .
being a graduate student at stanford university , <unk> this very , very high @-@ level grocery store , at least at that time , was very sophisticated .
it was called <unk> .
it was almost like going to an amusement park .
there were about 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar , over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of bottled water , and this was when we were taking water from the faucet .
i love going to that store , but one time i wondered , why don &apos;t i buy anything ?
this is the olive oil shelf .
they had over 75 different classes , including the ones that were in a sealed box that came out of trees .
i once decided to go to the manager and say , &quot; well , do you have this strategy to offer all these choices ? &quot;
he pointed out the buses full of tourists every day , usually with his cameras .
we decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> . this is the <unk> .
they had different kinds .
we set up a seat for <unk> , right at the entrance to the store .
we put there six tastes there , or 24 different flavors , and we looked at two things : first , what if people were willing to stop <unk> ?
more people stopped when there was 24 -- 60 percent , that when there were only six , 40 percent .
we also looked at what case they were most likely to purchase a <unk> .
here we find the opposite effect .
of those who stopped when it was 24 , only three percent came to buy <unk> .
the ones who stopped when there were six , we saw that 30 percent bought <unk> .
if we do the calculations , people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found <unk> than if they found 24 .
well , to decide that we don &apos;t buy <unk> , we probably want to make it much less good for keeping it off , but it turns out that the problem of choice overload us in such momentous decisions .
we decided not to decide , even when this doesn &apos;t hurt us .
now the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , where we &apos;re looking at decisions about retirement savings from about a million americans , of about 650 plans in this country .
we were interested in seeing if the number of funding offers available for retirement savings plans , the <unk> program , <unk> people to save for the future .
and we found that there really was a correlation .
we had <unk> plans that went from two , 59 to different options .
we found that the bigger the number of biomedical funds , there were less participation .
so , if we look at the edge , we see that in the plans that offer two funds , the participation rate was 70 or more , not as high as you would like .
and in the plans that some 60 funds , the participation rate brought down to the 60 .
it turns out even if you decide to engage , when there &apos;s more options , even in that case , there &apos;s negative consequences .
so , for those of you who decided to participate , the bigger the number of choices , the more people were empowered to avoid the actions or the investment funds .
as soon as there were more options , they were more willing to invest in financial accounts for the market .
but none of these extreme decisions are the ones that to optimize future wealth .
in the last decade we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities .
the most likely thing is to make the decision , that the decision still goes against the self @-@ interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make the worst decisions ; in finance and health .
they &apos;re more likely to pick things less satisfying , even though objectively not better .
the main reason is that we &apos;re going to start looking at this huge array of <unk> , mustard , vinegar , and vinegar , but we &apos;re not able to do the calculations to compare , contrast and choose that amazing exhibit .
i want to offer you four simple techniques that we have tried , in one way or another , in different research , so you can actually test them in your business .
the first is cut , cut .
you &apos;ve already heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , which is less .
people always get upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they care about losing space in <unk> .
but actually what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut off , get rid of odd options , there will be a higher increase in sales , you &apos;ll have a better experience in the choice .
when <unk> &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; d to 15 , they saw a 10 percent increase in sales .
when the corporation <unk> wiped out the products for <unk> of cats who were less sold , they scaled up the slaughter at 87 percent , for two reasons : higher sales and lower costs .
you know that the supermarkets today , on average , offer 60,000 products .
in a walmart store , there are about 100,000 products .
but the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and offers only <unk> products -- a kind of tomato sauce can .
in the world of financial savings , i think one of the best examples that has emerged out of how to handle better choices is david <unk> &apos;s argument , the harvard program .
all the harvard employees are automatically embedded in a safe living fund .
those who really want to pick , give them 20 funds , not 300 or more .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
they &apos;re all important options . &quot;
the first thing i do is , i ask employees , &quot; well , tell me the difference between those choices .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell the difference , they can &apos;t make your customers . &quot;
this afternoon , before i started this session , i was talking to gary .
he told me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience a vacation with all their money to the most beautiful highway in the world .
here , a description .
i want you to read it .
i &apos;m going to leave a few seconds to read it , and then i want you to give them a hand if you &apos;re ready to grab the deal with gary .
ok . anyone who &apos;s ready to accept the deal .
aren &apos;t they more ?
well , i &apos;m going to show you something else .
you knew there was a trick .
who &apos;s ready for that journey ?
i think i really got to hear more hands .
all right .
actually , you had more information in the first round , than in the second round , but i can tell you that they thought the second time was more real .
because the images made it more real .
this leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> overload that it &apos;s <unk> .
so for people to understand the difference between choice , they have to understand the consequences of every choice , and that the consequences must feel very deeply vivid , very concrete .
why is it that people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use card or credit cards , which when they use cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t look real money .
it turns out that making people look more real , it can be a very positive tool for people to enjoy more .
we did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , on staff of <unk> <unk> who worked at <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were attached to a biomedical plan .
at that meeting , we had exactly as it was used , we made it a little addition .
what we added was that we <unk> the staff to think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were more money .
with this <unk> , there was a spike in 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or whatever they wanted to put in their savings accounts , four percent .
the third technique is to classify .
we can handle more categories than options .
for example , this is a study we did in a magazine hall .
we saw that in the <unk> supermarkets , throughout the corridor of the northeast , the exhibition of magazines can hold on from different types to <unk> .
but , you know ?
if i show you 600 magazines and i do it in 10 categories , and i compare it to 400 <unk> in 20 groups , you &apos;ll believe that i &apos;ve offered them more choices and better choice experience if i offer those 400 , which if i put 600 .
because classification indicates me how to behave .
these are two pieces of jewelry .
one is called &quot; <unk> &quot; and the other , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> , you &apos;ll have a <unk> .
well , there are some .
if you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> , you &apos;ll have a <unk> .
well , something else .
it turns out it &apos;s correct .
the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know something ?
this set of classification is totally useless .
the categories need to indicate something which they choose , not what they call them .
you often see this problem with these huge fundraising lists .
supposedly , who are they informing ?
my fourth category : complexity <unk> .
it turns out we can handle a lot more information than we think , if we just manage it a little bit .
we have to increase complexity gradually .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s look at a complicated decision ; buy it from a car .
this is a german car manufacturer that allows for full @-@ time .
you have to make 60 decisions , so you have to build the car .
and these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one .
color , outer color in the car . i have 56 possibilities .
engine , change box , four choices .
what i &apos;m going to do is change the order where decisions come up .
so half of the clients are going to go from lots of options , 56 colors , just a few , four boxes .
the other half of the clients are going to go from a few options , four boxes , 56 colors , lots of options .
and what am i going to look at ?
how much you are involved .
if the default button in every decision , this indicates they &apos;re overwhelmed , i mean we &apos;re losing them .
we found that those who go from lots of options to a few , press the default button over and over again and over again .
we miss them .
if you go from a few choices to a lot , they continue there .
the same information , the same number of choices .
the only thing i did was to alter the order that the information presents .
if we start with the easy thing , you learn to pick .
even though the choice of change doesn &apos;t say anything about the preferences of interior decoration , in all ways makes us choice .
we &apos;re excited about a product that we &apos;re building , which is now more <unk> to the process .
to sum up .
i &apos;ve talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of choice : cutting , cutting , cutting out odd alternatives ; <unk> , make it real ; we can put in more categories with less options ; we can rearrange complexity .
all these techniques that i presented to you were designed to help drive the alternatives , or better , for you , to use them in your business , or for the people who serve .
i think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful .
and the more careful we stay in our elections , we &apos;ll be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , the youtube trends , and i look at youtube videos in a professional way .
it &apos;s true .
so today we &apos;re going to see why video is made viral and how important that is .
we all want to be celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was younger , that seemed a very , very difficult thing .
but today the video does make any of us , or of our actions , copper in a part of our global culture .
anyone can be famous on the internet in a <unk> .
over 48 hours to youtube hours per minute .
and , of those , just a small percentage gets viral , you get lots of views and you win cultural <unk> .
how does that happen ?
three things : maker of trends , community of participation and surprise factor .
well , let &apos;s start .
oh , my god , my god .
oh my god !
wow .
ow , ow !
last year , <unk> <unk> published this video clip outside his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was seen 23 million times .
this graph shows the views at the rise of popularity of last summer .
<unk> don &apos;t write a viral video .
i just wanted to share a rainbow twice .
that &apos;s what you do if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain <unk> .
i had already published a lot of videos of nature .
this video had been published in january .
so what happened here ?
it was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> this <unk> that <unk> the video to popularity .
makers of trends like jimmy <unk> present new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience .
it &apos;s friday . you have to start friday . everyone wants the weekend to come , last week . friday , starting friday . you wouldn &apos;t think we could have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
&quot; friday , &quot; rebecca is one of the most popular videos in the year .
they saw it almost 200 million times this year .
this graph shows the frequency of use .
just like , &quot; rainbow two , &quot; this video seemed to have emerged out of nowhere .
so , what happened this day ?
well , it &apos;s friday , it &apos;s true .
and if you ask for those other peaks , they &apos;re also friday .
but what happened this day , this particular friday ?
well , he took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it .
michael had put nelson in , from <unk> science theater , was one of the first people to make a joke on the video on twitter .
but what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of trends take a perspective and share it with a wider audience , accelerating the process .
so , this community of people who share this great inner joke then starts talking about it and doing things .
and now there are 10,000 <unk> of friday in youtube .
only in the first seven days , there was a parody for each of other days .
unlike 20th century entertainment , this communal involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with that .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation with a <unk> music .
so , that &apos;s it .
this year they saw it about 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s odd , you know , there &apos;s a three @-@ hour version that &apos;s been seen four million times .
even the cats saw this video .
and there are cats who saw other cats watching the video .
but what &apos;s important here is creativity that woke up between the internet <unk> community .
there was <unk> .
someone made a version of the old .
and then international became international .
suddenly , there was a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be part of .
because today we don &apos;t just enjoy , we get involved .
who could have predicted something like that ?
who could have predicted &quot; <unk> twice , &quot; or rebecca black or <unk> ? &quot;
what a script could have written that this situation ?
in a world where two days of video comes up for a minute , only that single , unexpected can actually tell us the way these things have done .
when a friend told me that i had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> riders in new york , i admit i &apos;m not really interested .
i &apos;m criticized for <unk> , but there are often obstacles that prevent you from running right through the <unk> .
thanks to the surprise effect and his humor , casey <unk> managed to get five million to see their idea .
so this approach is worth all the new things that we do in a creative way .
and all this leads to a big question .
what does this mean ?
<unk> .
what does this mean ?
the creators of trend , the creative communities of participation , the whole unexpected , are features of a new kind of media , of a new culture , which we all have access to , and is the audience that defines popularity .
as i said before , one of the current celebrities of the world , justin bieber , started on youtube .
don &apos;t ask permission to express your ideas .
now we &apos;re all a little owners of our pop culture .
these are not the characteristics of the old media , they &apos;re just the ones of today &apos;s media , but <unk> the future &apos;s entertainment .
thank you .
how can i invest in 10 minutes about the ties between women for more than three generations , how the incredible force of those ties will spread into the lives of a four @-@ year @-@ old girl , beside her sister , his little mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the sea of china , over 30 years ago , that girl has never died today .
this is not a finished story .
it &apos;s a puzzle that is still <unk> .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who is burning the work of a whole life .
he &apos;s a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been supported by the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country .
<unk> as the communist <unk> , <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain .
the words , so long as a friend of mine , now will get it .
he was silent .
he died broke through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never allowed me to forget her story .
my job was not to let that have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that history was trying to hate it , but they enjoyed it .
the next part of the puzzle is about a boat as quietly as the sea is silent .
my mother , <unk> , was only 18 years old when her father died , and a marriage and two little girls .
for her , life had been devoted to one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was inconceivable for her that she could not do it .
and then , from a four @-@ year @-@ old <unk> who defies fiction , a boat <unk> into the <unk> sea .
all adults knew the risks .
the greatest fear was pirates , rape and death .
like most adults , my mother was wearing a poison <unk> .
if i could catch , we &apos;d first take my sister and i , and then she and my grandmother .
my first memories are from that boat , the constant pace of the engine , <unk> it into every wave , and the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember pirates who came several times , but they were with the <unk> of the men in our boat , or the engine dying and not be able to break for six hours .
but i do remember the lights on the oil platform front of the coast of malaysia , and the young man who collapsed and died , finishing the journey was too much for him , and the first apple i tried , given by the men on the platform .
no apple then had the same taste .
after three months in a refugee camp , <unk> in melbourne .
and the next piece of puzzle is about four women across three generations , giving a new life together .
we set up in <unk> , a working @-@ class <unk> , whose population is made up of immigrants .
unlike the middle @-@ class suburbs , whose existence i grew , in <unk> , there was no sense of the right .
the smells that came from the shops were from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> english fragments was amongst the people who had a common thing : they were starting again .
my mother worked in farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , twice .
yet , he found time to study english and get a title in it .
we were poor .
all the dollars were getting tired , and yet there was an extra <unk> in english and math , not care what was supposed to be removed , which was usually new clothing ; it was always second @-@ hand .
two middle pairs for school , one to hide holes in the other .
a school uniform up to the ankles , because it had to last six years .
and there were weird , <unk> about the <unk> eyes and some graffiti : &quot; <unk> , come home . &quot;
where ?
something in me <unk> .
i was accumulating determination and a voice saying , &quot; i &apos;m going to pray . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i <unk> in the same bed .
my mother was <unk> every night , but we were told about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at home .
my mother suffered , all of the ship .
and my task was to be awake until its nightmares began in order to be able to nurse him .
she opened a computer store , then she studied to be a <unk> and opened another business .
and the women would come with their stories about men who couldn &apos;t make the transition , angry and <unk> , and children would gather between two worlds .
they looked for subsidies and sponsors .
and they created centers .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , it was the classic asian student , <unk> with what <unk> of myself .
in the other hand , i was <unk> in <unk> lives , tragically <unk> by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
but a lot of help over the years .
and for that work , when i studied my last year of <unk> , i was elected the young australian year .
and i was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other , but its edges didn &apos;t match .
so le <unk> , anonymous <unk> , was now le <unk> , <unk> and social activist , invited to speak at sites that i had never heard , and in homes whose life she would never have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to retreat into the families and the comfortable life on a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for nearly 20 years , <unk> on the day of every single day , and <unk> , the three still in bed .
and i told my mom i couldn &apos;t do it .
it reminded me that i had now the same age that she had when we got on the boat .
the &quot; had never been a choice .
do it , &quot; he said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you don &apos;t know . &quot;
so i talked about juvenile <unk> and education and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> .
and the more frankly i was talking about , the more i was glad to speak .
i met people from all the pathways of life , many of them doing what they loved , living on the border of the possible .
and even though i finished my graduate degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t stay in a career of <unk> .
there had to be another piece of puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s well to be a stranger , a very recently arrived , new onstage -- and not only that it &apos;s okay , but it &apos;s something to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
because being inside can easily mean <unk> the horizons , it can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your province .
i gave the enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not the way we fear .
possibilities that hadn &apos;t been <unk> were tremendously <unk> .
there was an energy there , a <unk> optimism , a rare mix of humility and courage .
so i follow my intuition .
i joined a small group of people for whom the slogan &quot; cannot be done &quot; was a compelling challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
at the end of every day , he was making a giant soup pot that we all shared .
we worked up to the entrance to night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but some brilliant ones , and we opened up .
i made the decision of <unk> the u.s.
after a single journey .
my hunch again .
three months later , i had moved , and adventure continued .
before i finish , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who cared .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after she was born .
the mother grew up alone .
when he was 17 , he became a mandarin <unk> whose mother beat him up .
without support of her husband , he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to get the cause herself , and much more <unk> caused when he won .
the &quot; can &apos;t be done &quot; showed up .
i was in the shower in a hotel room in sydney when she died , a mile away in melbourne .
i looked down through the shower and i watched her stop the other side .
i knew i had come to <unk> .
my mother called for minutes later .
days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his coffin .
we tell stories and make sure that we were still with it .
at night a monk came in and told us that he had to close his coffin .
my mother asked us to hold her hand .
he asked the monk : &quot; why is his hand hot , and the rest of the body so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve taken your hand since the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they haven &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a nerve in our family , that &apos;s running through women .
given who we were and how life formed us , we can now see that the men who would have reached our lives would have frustrated us .
the defeat would have easily <unk> .
now i want to have my own kids , and i wonder about the boat .
who could wish for that ?
yet , i fear the privilege of the easy , the right .
can i give you a <unk> in your life , <unk> in every wave , the constant pace of the engine , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give them and see them safe , i would .
<unk> <unk> and also the <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth line .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
or is it a photograph ?
because , of course , they &apos;re pictures that they can &apos;t take with their cameras .
my interest in photography was introduced to my first digital camera to 15 years .
he was associated with my previous passion for the drawing , but he was a little bit different because using the camera , the process was in planning .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends up when you click the <unk> .
for me , photography had more to do with being in the right place , at the right time .
i thought anyone could do it .
so i wanted to create something different , a process that actually started <unk> the <unk> .
pictures like this : a very <unk> road construction .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and , despite that , it holds a level of <unk> .
or pictures like these dark and colorful pictures at the same time , but with the common goal of keeping track level .
and when i say <unk> , i say <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that i can tell you , but i always want it to be captured in some way like photography .
photos where you will have to think for a moment to discover the trick .
it has more to do with capturing an idea that has to capture a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes them look real ?
are the details , or the colors ?
does light intervene ?
what does the illusion create ?
sometimes the illusion is perspective .
but ultimately , it &apos;s our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a two @-@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s actually not about whether it &apos;s realistic , it &apos;s about what we think it &apos;s realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality .
i &apos;ll show you a simple example .
here we have three objects perfectly imaginable , something that we can all relate to the three @-@ dimensional world .
but they combined , in a sense , can create something that still looks three @-@ dimensional -- as if it existed .
but at the same time , we know it doesn &apos;t exist .
so , tell the brain , because the brain doesn &apos;t really accept the fact that that doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process by combining pictures .
it really is about combining different realities .
and the things that make a realistic photo look like this , i think , are those in which we don &apos;t even think about -- the things around us in our everyday life .
but when we combine pictures , it &apos;s very important to consider it , because otherwise something will look bad .
so i &apos;d like to say , there are three simple rules that i &apos;m going to go on to achieve realistic results .
as you can see , these images are not very special .
but combined , you can create something like this .
so the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective .
second , the pictures combined must have the same kind of light .
and these two images play with these requirements ; they &apos;re taken at the same height and with the same kind of light .
the third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of all different images with a perfect union .
it has to be impossible to see where the image <unk> .
by measuring the color , the contrast and the <unk> on the edges that are there between the images , by adding birth defects as depth of field , <unk> colors and noise , <unk> the boundaries between the various images and make it look a single , even though a picture can actually have hundreds of layers .
this is another example .
you might think this is the picture of a landscape , and the bottom is being manipulated .
but this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places .
personally , i think it &apos;s easier to create a place to find it , because you don &apos;t have to put ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and as i thought about this idea in winter , i knew that i had several months to get , to find the different locations for the puzzle pieces .
for example , the fish was captured on a fishing journey .
the shores are from a different location .
the <unk> part was captured in a rock well .
and yes , i even did a red house on the top of the island so it sounds more swedish .
so to make a realistic result , i think we need planning .
you always start with a sketch , an idea .
then you have to combine the different photographs .
and here , every piece is really cool .
if you do a good job when you take the photos , the result can be very beautiful and very crude .
all the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about why a lot of health and health projects fail .
and i think , really , the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at <unk> university was we <unk> a director of the listening .
and not in a very scientific way , she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients , family and they know , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
&quot; how can we help it ? &quot;
and we tend to think , this is one of the biggest problems that we all , or maybe not everyone , but most of the projects of and wellness , because we stop listening .
this is my logarithmic scale . this is a very simple thing .
it has a flip @-@ and @-@ off switch .
every morning i get up .
and yes , i have a challenge you can see .
i got the challenge of getting 95 kilograms .
but it &apos;s so simple , that every time i link up , it sends my information to google health .
and my doctor at <unk> has access to him too . so , he can see what my weight problem is , not at the same time when he needs <unk> or some urgency of that style , but to see him backwards .
but there &apos;s another thing .
as some of you know , i have over 4,000 followers on twitter .
so , every morning i &apos;m going to link to a <unk> @-@ wi @-@ fi scale and before i go up to my car , people start telling me , &quot; <unk> , i think you need a light lunch today . &quot;
that &apos;s the best thing that can happen , because it &apos;s peer pressure to help patients , because it could be used for obesity , and also for patients to stop smoking .
on the other hand , you can <unk> them to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health .
from next week , it will be available .
this little <unk> attached to an iphone or another device .
and people will be able , from their homes , take their blood pressure , send it to their doctor , share it with others , for example , for 100 dollars .
this is the point where patients assume a position , they come back to <unk> control and to be captains of their own boat , but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face , like the firing costs of attention , the <unk> of demand and other issues .
making techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team .
and you can do it with techniques like this , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we did want to share with you with a video .
we all have car navigation controls .
maybe we even have them in our cell phones .
we know perfectly where atm machines are .
also where are all the <unk> .
and of course , we can find fast food chains .
but where is the closest <unk> to help this patient ?
we didn &apos;t know .
no one knew where to get <unk> saving lives right now .
so , what we did was , we <unk> the netherlands .
we create a website , and we asked the public to say , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please tell us where , and when it &apos;s open , &quot; because they sometimes open up in offices and others are closed .
and over 10,000 <unk> already were introduced in the netherlands .
the next step was to look for the application for that .
and we did an app for the ipad .
we create an app for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these <unk> .
and every time you &apos;re in the city of <unk> and someone collapses , you can use your iphone , and the next weeks you can use your mouse phone to find the closest <unk> , which can save lives .
and from today , i would like to present this one , not just like <unk> <unk> , which is the name of the product , but also like <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to bring them globally .
we &apos;re taking all the colleagues around the world , in other universities , to help us find , work and act as a hub for the throughout the world .
every time you &apos;re on holiday and someone , it can be a relative or someone in front of you , you can find it .
i also would like to invite companies around the world who could help us deal with these <unk> .
they could be charitable services , for example , to see if the <unk> that shows is still in place .
please get into this and not only improve health , but take control of it .
thank you very much .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little company is trying to engage the environment that is focused on ...
the distributed collaboration .
this is a little video of what we do .
mm : wait a minute .
you can take a little bit of charge .
we can -- we can continue -- we better leave the video one side .
no .
this is not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
oh , i mean , you know ?
all right . thank you very much .
a couple of years ago , i set up an initiative to recruit the greatest designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we &apos;re supposed to do ; we &apos;re asking them to work in government .
the initiative was called america code , and it would be like some <unk> of peace <unk> .
we select a few members every year and got them to work with the municipalities .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them to the wild city world .
they made big apps ; they worked with employees .
his homework is about showing the possibilities of current technology .
meet al .
it &apos;s a fire hydrant from the city of boston .
here comes as if i &apos;m looking for a date , but what i &apos;m really looking for is someone who has been <unk> when it &apos;s caught by snow , because he knows it &apos;s not very good at putting fires when it &apos;s covered by a foot of snow .
how did it get to ask help in this particular way ?
last year in boston , we had a team of members of code for america .
they were there in february , and at that time they weren &apos;t very much last year .
they realized that the city never wiped these <unk> .
but one of the members called erik <unk> @-@ <unk> had noticed something else : that citizens compared to <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them .
so he did as any good programmer , he developed an app .
it &apos;s a nice application in which you can take a fire hydrant .
you accept <unk> when you win .
when you do , you put a name on it , in this case you put al .
if you don &apos;t , someone can get you .
i mean , it has a playful component .
it &apos;s a modest application .
maybe it &apos;s the smallest of the 21 applications that are happening last year .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
and it spreads in viral form .
a responsible driver of systems in the city of <unk> when he saw this application , he realized that he could use it , not for snow , but for the citizens to embrace the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important for these tar sands , but people steal the batteries .
so he asks the citizens to control them .
and then seattle decided to use it to get the citizens to prescribe the <unk> .
and chicago has just taken it out to get people to clear sidewalks when they were <unk> .
so now we know nine cities that we can use it .
and this has spread out <unk> , organically and natural ways .
if you know a little bit of government technology , you &apos;ll know that this doesn &apos;t happen normally .
the software acquisition usually takes a couple of years .
last year in boston , we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months .
it was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children .
then we were told that , in fact , for the normal channels it would have taken at least two years and a half million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
now , there &apos;s a project in the california <unk> that has , up until now , two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that shows up in a couple of days and spreads in viral form is a kind of warning to the institution of government .
it suggests the best ways to work , not like private companies , like a lot of people think it should be .
neither like a technological company , but rather like the internet itself .
i mean , no constraints , open and <unk> .
and that &apos;s important .
but the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of addressing the government question of the new generation -- not as a problem of an institution -- but as a collective action problem .
and that &apos;s very good because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
and there &apos;s a very large community of people who are building the tools to build them together effectively .
and it &apos;s not just america &apos;s code , but there are hundreds of people across the country that contribute to civic apps every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up with government .
they feel a great frustration to that , but they don &apos;t complain , they fix it .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from sight .
and that is , if we stop the feelings about politics , row in the <unk> and all those other things that put us insane , the government is essentially , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we do together because we cannot . &quot;
now , a lot of people have cleaned up the government .
if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask you to celebrate it , because things are changing .
politics does not change ; government does .
and because the government ultimately generates of us -- do you remember that from &quot; we , the people &quot; ? the way we think about it will affect the way we make change .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started with this .
and as a lot of people thought that the government was about to choose people to make charges .
well , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that government is , above all , a matter of <unk> .
this is the telephone center of service and information .
it &apos;s the place that manages phone calls if you smile in america .
if you ever have the opportunity to work in a city center like scott <unk> like part of this initiative -- in fact , everybody will find that people call the government with a very broad range of issues , even when it finds a <unk> in the house .
scott <unk> this call .
he entered &quot; <unk> &quot; at the official knowledge base .
he found nothing . he started with animal control .
and he finally said , &quot; hey , can you open the doors of the house , put quiet music and see if it goes ? &quot;
and it worked . so , scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston has no call center .
it has an app , web and mobile , called <unk> .
don &apos;t give that application .
it was the work of very smart people at the office of new <unk> mechanics in boston .
one day , this really happened , came up with this request , &quot; <unk> in my garbage cube . i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s dead .
how do i make it for ? &quot;
<unk> &apos;s dynamic is different .
scott was speaking in person .
<unk> <unk> is all public , so everyone can see this .
in this case , he saw a neighbor .
the next report said , &quot; i went to the place , i found the garbage cube behind the house .
okay ? yes . yes .
i turned the bucket . i went home .
good evening , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the confluence of digital and physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government &apos;s income for distributed collaboration .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean the technological definition of platform .
i talk about a platform for people to come in and help others .
so , a citizen helped another , but here the government had a key role .
he connected the two people .
and it could be connected to government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services .
when a neighbor helps another , it <unk> communities .
if we call animal control , that costs a lot of money .
one important thing we have to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
a lot of people understand it , but think you &apos;re the input from the other .
our entry into the government system is voting .
how many times have you chosen a political leader , sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs , but then we don &apos;t see changes .
that &apos;s because government is like huge ocean and politics is the surface of 15 @-@ centimeter surface .
below that &apos;s what we call bureaucracy .
and we say that word with a lot of contempt .
but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps what it belongs to us that we fund as something that operates on our counter , that other thing , and therefore we &apos;re losing power .
people think politics is sensual .
if we want this institution to work , we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government work happens .
we have to collaborate with government machinery .
that makes <unk> motion .
have you seen them ?
it &apos;s a group of citizens concerned that they have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the <unk> of the financial reform project .
that &apos;s not political activism , it &apos;s bureaucratic activism .
and for those of us who have come to our government , it &apos;s time for us to ask what world we want to leave our children .
you have to see the huge challenges that they will have to deal with .
do you really believe that we &apos;re going to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in the name of everyone ?
we cannot do it without government ; we need it to be more effective .
the good news is that with technology , it is possible to rethink the root function of government , so that it can expand the public society .
there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet , and it knows that it &apos;s not that difficult to act <unk> , you just have to articulate the systems in the right way .
the average age of our members is 28 years old , so i , <unk> , i &apos;m a bigger generation than many of them .
this is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted .
they &apos;re not giving that battle that we all face about who &apos;s going to talk about ; they &apos;re all going to talk .
they can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and do .
so when they face the government problem , they don &apos;t really care about making their voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they put hands on the work to program applications that make government better work .
and those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
it can be stored a fire hydrant , taking weeds , casting a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside .
of course , we were always able to have those <unk> and a lot of people do .
but these applications are like digital <unk> that we &apos;re not only consumers , we &apos;re not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services .
we &apos;re more than that : we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix government until we don &apos;t <unk> citizenship .
so i want to ask everybody here , when it comes to the important things that we have to do together , all of us together , will we be a crowd of voices , or will we also be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
i generally try to explain to people how wonderful they &apos;re going to be the new technologies that are emerging . you have to look backward to understand what &apos;s going on . here among friends , i want to tell you what i think of these big technological advances , just so powerful that we can barely slow down .
i &apos;ll start showing you a slide about technology , very boring .
please , if you can put it in ...
it &apos;s a diagram anyone i took from a folder of mine .
i &apos;m not so interested in showing you the details , but the general thing .
this is an analysis we were doing on the power of microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that this , like many other people we tend to see , is a kind of straight line on a log scale .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in the yield scale .
talking about technology with curved curves is something new .
here &apos;s something weird .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m going to talk about .
please light the lights .
it would need more intensity because it would take on paper .
why would you change technological curves on <unk> ?
the answer is , if you were to draw them on a normal curve where , say , these are the years , or some unit of time , and this would be any measure of the technology that i would like to chart , the diagram would look kind of ridiculous .
it would be something like this .
it doesn &apos;t say much .
but if we were , for example , some other technology , like transportation , on a <unk> curve would be really dumb , we would see a straight line .
but if something like this happens , it gives you a qualitative change .
if the transportation technology would be as fast as the microprocessors , past morning we could take a taxi and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
but we don &apos;t move through that pace .
there &apos;s no precedent in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years advance from magnitude .
the question i want to make is -- we look at these exponential curves , we see that they don &apos;t go forever .
you cannot support this change as fast as it goes .
it will happen one of two things .
or it &apos;s going to become a typical s @-@ like curve , like this till something comes up completely different , or maybe it will do something like this .
that &apos;s all that can happen .
i &apos;m optimistic , so i think maybe something like this .
if we were , now we would be in the middle of a transition .
in this line , we &apos;re in a transition from what used to be the world , to a new way .
so what i &apos;m trying to ask , and i &apos;m asking , is , what is that new way for the world ?
where is the new state going ?
the transition looks very , very confused if we &apos;re embedded in it .
i remember , as a child , the future was in 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
this is a conference where people talk about the future , and we see that the future is still 2000 .
that &apos;s all we see .
in other words , the future has collapsed , year after year , throughout my life .
but i think it &apos;s because we feel something &apos;s going on .
this is a transformation . we can feel it .
and we know that it doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense to think of 30 or 50 years , because it &apos;s all going to be so different that we &apos;re doing today doesn &apos;t make any sense .
so i want to talk to you about how that might be , how could that transition that we experience .
but to do that , i &apos;m going to have to talk a little bit about things that don &apos;t have a lot to do with technology and computer technology .
because i think the only way to understand it is to take a long @-@ term and look at long @-@ term things .
the time scale that i would like to do is the time of life on earth .
i think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years .
so , we go back about 2.5 billion years when the earth was a big barren rock with a lot of chemicals that migrated around it .
if we look at the way those chemicals organized , we give us an idea of how things happened .
and i think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of rna . i &apos;m going to tell you a simple version of this , and that is , at the time , there were some oil <unk> out of all kinds of chemical recipes inside .
some of these oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside , so the blobs grew up .
and they started to divide .
in a sense , those were the most primitive cell forms -- those oil <unk> .
but those blobs were not alive , in the current sense , because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals .
and every time it was <unk> an unequal distribution of chemicals inside .
so every single <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the blobs that were somehow getting better than an hour to incorporate the chemicals around , grew more chemical , and grew more chemical into it .
they were living longer ; they were more represented .
it was a form of life , chemistry , very simple chemistry , but things got interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction .
in a way that we don &apos;t really understand these very well , they learned how to store information .
they learned to store information , which was the recipe for the cell , in a special chemical called dna .
in other words , <unk> in this evolution without any sense , a writing system that allowed them to register what amazing is that the writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 billion years .
our recipe , our genes , have exactly the same code , that same writing system .
in fact , every living thing is expressed exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
and one of the things i did just for fun -- we can now write things with this code .
here i have 100 <unk> of white dust that i try to hide the people of airport security .
but it contains -- <unk> this code -- the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and i wrote my personal data into this excerpt of dna , and it <unk> 10 to 22 times .
so if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card , i have many for everyone here , actually , for every single person in the world and is here .
if he was a <unk> , he would have put him in a virus and he would have spread him through the room .
what was the next step ?
writing dna was an interesting step .
this made these cells happy to be happy another billion years .
but then there was another big interesting step in which things got really different , and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know it , but bacteria can exchange dna .
so , for example , evolved antibiotic resistance .
some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little dna with other bacteria and now there &apos;s a lot of penicillin because bacteria communicate .
this communication gave rise to communities that , in a way , were together in that , and there was a synergy .
so , whether or not a community together , or whether a community was very successful , all the individuals of that community got more and more <unk> by evolution .
and the tipping point happened when these communities came so close that , in fact , they came together and decided to write the whole prescription of the community into a string of dna .
the next interesting stage for life took another billion years .
and at that stage we have <unk> communities , communities of many different cell types working together as just one organism .
in fact , we &apos;re a <unk> community .
we have lots of cells that don &apos;t act alone .
the skin cell doesn &apos;t work without the heart , or the muscles cell , or the brain , and so on .
so , these communities evolved and bred more interesting levels than cell phones , something we call an organism .
the next level occurred within these communities .
these started <unk> information .
and to build very special structures that couldn &apos;t do more than process information in community .
these are the neural structures .
neurons are the devices that process the information that these mobile communities built .
in fact , they started <unk> inside the community being responsible for processing structures , understanding and transmit information .
those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that moment as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism , and not the evolutionary period .
so , an organism could , for example , learn not to eat any fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time he ate it .
that could happen during the life of an organism , because they had previously built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit .
so , the fact that the nervous system built those structures of information that were greatly accelerated the evolutionary process .
because evolution could now happen confined to an individual .
it could happen in the time necessary to learn .
but then , of course , individuals discovered the trick of communication .
so , for example , the most refined version we know is human language .
if we think about it , it &apos;s an amazing invention .
i have a very complicated idea , a vague idea in my head .
i &apos;m here sitting emitting some <unk> and , hopefully , building a similar idea , vague and confused idea in his head that keeps some analogy to mine .
but we took something very complicated , we converted it into sound , in sound sequences , and we produce something very complicated in another brain .
that now allows us to start running like an organism .
in fact , as humanity , we &apos;ve started doing <unk> .
now we go through a very similar amount of grid organisms ; we <unk> our methods of record , presentation and information processing .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
so , computer telephony , video tape , cd @-@ rom , and so on are the specialized mechanisms that we now build that information .
and that brings us into something much bigger , faster and able to evolve more than we could before .
now evolution can happen at microseconds .
you saw the evolutionary <unk> in which there was some evolution with the <unk> program , before our eyes .
and now we &apos;ve <unk> the scales of time again .
the earliest stages of the story that led to a billion years each .
the next stages , the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
the next , language and so on , took less than a million years .
and the next , like electronics , it just looks like taking a few decades .
the process <unk> ; i guess self @-@ organizing is the right word to name something that <unk> its own pace of change .
the more it changes , the faster it does .
and i think that &apos;s what we see in this explosion of the curve .
we see the process <unk> .
but i make my living by designing computers , and i know that the job mechanisms for <unk> may not be possible without the recent computer advances .
but now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to engage in a conventional way .
i don &apos;t know it does every transistor in that string of connections .
there are billions .
instead , with the designers of <unk> <unk> , we think a level of abstraction , we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that never could before , it gets much further and much faster than ever before .
in fact , sometimes it uses methods that we don &apos;t even understand well .
a particularly interesting method that i &apos;ve been using lately is evolution itself .
inside the machine , an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds .
and , for example , in the most extreme cases , we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions .
we say , &quot; for computer , can you run a hundred million sequences of random instructions ?
would you run these sequences of random instructions , run all those programs , and take those who are the ones that we want to do ? &quot;
in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to give you numbers , just to give you a simple example .
so , we found the programs that get closer to <unk> numbers .
of course , it &apos;s unlikely a few random instruction sequences , <unk> numbers , so none of them succeeded .
but one , fortunately , could put two numbers in the right order .
and i said , &quot; computer , could you take 10 percent of those random random random sequences they did ?
he <unk> those and <unk> the rest .
and now they were looking at the numbers best .
and let &apos;s go back to <unk> followed an analog process to sex . &quot;
let &apos;s take two programs , give them kids , and we &apos;ll test them , and we &apos;ll test the properties of both programs .
so we got a new generation of software programs that had a little more success .
and we say , &quot; please repeat the process . &quot;
try it again .
you put in some mutations .
and it tries again and it <unk> with another generation .
well , every generation carries a few milliseconds .
so , i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or , in some complicated cases , in a few hours .
ultimately , we ended up with programs that report numbers absolutely perfect .
in fact , these are much more efficient programs than i could have written by hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to analyze it to see how they work .
these are dark programs , strange .
but they do the job .
in fact , i know , i have the security that they achieve the aim , because they come from a hundred thousand of thousand programs that did .
in fact , their lives made fun of it .
once i &apos;d go on a 747 with ubuntu and get a card and say , &quot; look at this .
he says , &quot; this plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer safe flight . don &apos;t you feel quiet ? &quot;
we know that engineering processes don &apos;t work very well when they become complicated .
so we started to rely on computers to make very different design processes .
and that allows us to produce much more complex things than what normal engineering does .
however , we don &apos;t understand the whole options there are .
in that sense , it goes ahead of us .
we now use these programs to make much faster computers and so we can run these programs much faster .
i mean , they <unk> .
the thing goes faster and faster , and that &apos;s why i think it looks so confusing .
because all these technologies are getting tired .
we &apos;re <unk> .
and we &apos;re at an analog moment to the one @-@ celled organisms when they became multicellular .
we &apos;re the <unk> and we can &apos;t understand what the hell we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re at the tipping point .
but i think something comes behind us .
i think it would be really arrogant about our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all part of the creation of whatever it comes to .
but now comes lunch , and i think i &apos;ll stop here before i get scared .
my story starts at <unk> about two years ago .
i was in the desert , under the <unk> sky , with the sufi <unk> singer .
we were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient indian <unk> &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
in those days when the indians wanted to travel for a car and remove the sky .
now we do it with airplanes .
at that time when <unk> , the great indian warrior , he had thirst , he was dragging a bow out and with a <unk> on the ground , he got water .
now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines .
the conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic .
and that made me very much fun .
every time i felt a little more about myself .
i was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if i didn &apos;t have the camera , if i couldn &apos;t afford my friends .
it seemed to me that technology had to allow magic , don &apos;t save it .
as a child , my grandfather gave me his silver <unk> .
and this 50 @-@ year @-@ old technology was for me the most magic thing .
it became a golden gateway to a world full of images , of pirates and <unk> in my imagination .
i had a sense of the mobile phone , the luxury clocks , and the cameras prevent them from coming .
we spark our inspiration .
so i set up , i threw myself into this technological world to see how we use it to create magic , rather than owning it .
i illustrate books from 16 years .
so when i saw the ipad , i saw a storytelling device able to connect readers of the whole world .
you can know how we take the book .
where we are .
gather the text with the image , the animation , the sound and touch .
storytelling becomes increasingly <unk> .
but what &apos;s good for us ?
i &apos;m about to launch <unk> , an interactive application for the ipad .
he says , &quot; puts your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so ... <unk> : &quot; this box belongs to &quot; -- i write my name .
and so i go back to a character of the book .
in a number of moments , i have a <unk> -- the ipad knows where i live from gps -- that &apos;s driven to me .
my inner girl gets excited by all these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
and i don &apos;t mean magicians and dragons , but that magic of childhood , to those ideas that arise from children .
for some reason , fireflies in a jar were always <unk> me .
so , over here , we have to <unk> the ipad to release fireflies .
and , really , they light your way into what &apos;s behind the book .
another idea that i was fascinated with as a child was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk> .
so here , every book and every world transforms into a <unk> that i <unk> into this magic device inside the device .
and this opens up a map .
in every fantasy book , there have always been maps , but there have been <unk> maps .
this is a map that grows , and <unk> you for the rest of the book .
in certain points of the book , it also reveals .
now i &apos;m going to go in .
another extremely important aspect to me is to create indian content and contemporary time .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of fairies and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian counterparts , the <unk> ?
these poor <unk> have been trapped in the hall cameras for millennia , in an old , <unk> book .
so we &apos;re bringing them back into a contemporary child story .
in a story that deals with existing issues like the environmental crisis .
and , speaking of the environmental crisis , one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked up , glued to their pcs , have not gone out into the outside world .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
one of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside , take the camera or the ipad , and collect images from different objects .
as a girl , i had lots of collections : sticks , stones , <unk> and shells .
for some reason , kids don &apos;t .
so , to reclaim this ritual of childhood , you have to go out and , in a chapter , you have a photo of a flower and then proceed .
in another chapter , you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then proceed .
this is how you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the web .
a kid in london puts a photo of a fox and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been taken .
within the variants of connection between magic , earth and technology , there are many possibilities .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to have an interaction where one comes out with the ipad and video is controlled and by augmented actually , you see a bunch of cartoons that appear about the interior plants of the house .
in a moment , the screen is full of leaves .
and you have to make the sound of the wind and the <unk> so you can read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology are coming up with one another .
we take advantage of the energy of the sun .
we &apos;re approaching our children and ourselves into the natural world and that magic , joy and child love that we feel through a simple story .
thank you .
this is for me a real honor .
i &apos;ve spent most of the time in prisons , prisons and death row .
i &apos;ve spent most of my life in <unk> communities , in projects and places where there &apos;s a lot of despair .
and being here at ted , watching and listening to these stimuli has given me a lot of energy .
one of the things i &apos;ve noticed in this short time is that ted has identity .
and the things that are said here have an impact on everyone .
occasionally , if something comes from ted , it makes sense and a force that would not have otherwise .
i say this because i think identity is important .
here we &apos;ve seen fantastic presentations .
and i think we have learned that words from a teacher can make a lot of sense , but if you &apos;re taught with feeling , you can have a special meaning .
a doctor can do good things , if it &apos;s <unk> , it can do much more .
so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t really learn this in the practice of the right , my job .
i learned it from my grandmother .
i grew up in a traditional home of an african american family dominated by a matriarch , who was my grandmother .
it was hard ; it was hard ; it had power .
it was the last word in the entire family .
she <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home .
she was a daughter of people who had been a slave .
his parents were born in slavery in virginia over the 1840 .
she was born on the 1880 and her experience with slavery in a way of looking at the world .
she was hard , but she was also loving .
when i was a little kid and i looked at her , she would come up and give me a nice hug .
i was so strong that i could barely breathe , and then i was overwhelmed .
one or two hours later , she would come back and look at her , and she would come up and say , &quot; <unk> , do you still feel my hug ? &quot;
and if he told him no , he grabs me again and he would say yes , he would leave me alone .
i had this human quality that would always wish you to be near it .
the only problem is , i had 10 kids .
my mother was the youngest of 10 .
occasionally , when i was going to spend a time with her , it wasn &apos;t easy to catch your time and your attention .
my cousins were running all over the place .
i remember when i was eight or nine years old , i woke up one morning , i went to the room and they were running through all my cousins .
my grandmother was on the other side of the room and stares at me .
at first i thought it was a game .
so i looked at her and looked at her , but she was very serious .
after 15 or 20 minutes , she got up , she went in the room , took me out of my hand and said , &quot; come <unk> . we &apos;re going to discuss them . &quot;
i remember this as it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget .
he took me outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you can &apos;t tell anyone . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
she said , &quot; now we &apos;ll make sure you won &apos;t . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
then he sat me down , and he said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
he said , &quot; i think you can do whatever you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget .
then he said , &quot; i just want you to get me three things , get me . &quot;
i said , &quot; <unk> , <unk> . &quot;
and he said , &quot; the first thing i want you to tell me is that we always want your mother . &quot;
he said , &quot; she &apos;s my <unk> , and you have to make sure you &apos;re always going to die . &quot;
as i went to my mom , i said , &quot; yes , <unk> , i will . &quot;
then he said , &quot; the second thing i want you to tell me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing , even though it &apos;s hard . &quot;
i thought about it , i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;ll pray . i will . &quot;
then , finally he said , &quot; the third thing i want you to give me is that i &apos;ll never get alcohol . &quot;
i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , <unk> , i will . &quot;
i grew up in the field , in rural south . i have a brother a year older and a sister for a less year .
when i was 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home with a six @-@ beers , i don &apos;t know where he got it , he grabs my sister and i left us to the forest .
we &apos;re just doing the crazy things of the time .
he took a drink of beer , offered my sister , she took a little drink and offered me to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . okay . you follow , but i &apos;m not going to take beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; come on . i &apos;ll listen to him now . and you &apos;ll always do the same thing as us .
i already took something , your sister , too . take a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; no . i won &apos;t feel good . you can follow . &quot;
then my brother looks at me .
and he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? take a beer . &quot;
i went in and looked in and it went , &quot; oh , it &apos;s not going to be you still thinking about the conversation with <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; but what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; but breast tells all the grandchildren that are special . &quot;
i was terrified .
i have to admit something to you .
i &apos;ll tell you something that probably shouldn &apos;t say .
i know this is widely <unk> .
but i have 52 years , and i can admit that i &apos;ve never taken a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying this by thinking it &apos;s a virtue ; i say it by the power of identity .
when we create the right type of identity , we say things to others that really don &apos;t make sense .
we can &apos;t get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
i think my grandmother naturally believed that all her grandchildren were special .
my grandfather had been a prisoner during the court .
my uncles died from diseases related to alcohol .
and these were the things that , according to her , we had to commit .
now , i &apos;m going to try and talk about our criminal justice system .
this country is now very different than it was 40 years ago .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 prisoners .
today , there are 2.3 million .
in america , we have the largest incarceration rate in the world .
we have seven million people in liberty .
and this mass incarceration , in my view , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor communities or black communities , there is so much <unk> , so much despair , determined by these facts .
one out of every three black between 18 and 30 years is in jail or in liberty .
in urban <unk> across the country , los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington , 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail or in freedom .
our system is not only distorted in front of the race , but it is also about poverty .
in this country , we have a criminal system that treat you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty , that if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
it &apos;s not guilt ; it &apos;s wealth that affects outcomes .
and we seem to feel very quiet .
the politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems with us .
we &apos;re disconnected .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
we &apos;re looking at some pretty curious developments .
in my state , in alabama , as well as in other states , you &apos;re <unk> rights forever if you have a criminal conviction .
right now in alabama , 34 percent of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote .
and if we toss it to the next 10 years , the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before we <unk> the law of the right to vote .
we have this amazing silence .
i represent children .
many of my clients are very young .
america is the only country in the world where 13 @-@ year @-@ old children die in prison .
we have in this country in jail for children , unable to ever come .
right now we &apos;re in a process of some litigation .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in the death row .
this issue of death row is interesting .
in a sense , we have <unk> to think that the final question is , do people deserve to die for the <unk> ?
a very sensitive question .
but you can think differently about how we are in our identity .
there &apos;s another way of looking at it : it &apos;s not about deciding whether people deserve to die for their crimes saved , but if we deserve to kill .
this is interesting .
death penalty in america is defined by mistake .
of every nine people who have drunk , they have identified one that is innocent that it &apos;s <unk> and released from the death row .
a bug rate , astonishing -- an innocent rate of every nine .
this is interesting .
in aviation , you would never be able to never afford airplanes if in every nine that you would have <unk> , you would have <unk> .
but somehow we get sick of the problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these things .
i talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill .
it &apos;s interesting that in my classes with students in african @-@ american history , i talk to you about slavery .
i tell you about terrorism , the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and lasted to world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know much about this .
but for black americans in this country , it was a seminal time defined by terror .
in many communities , people were afraid of being <unk> .
they were worried to be distracted .
the threat of terror was what defined their lives .
now , there are older people who come up to me and say , &quot; mr. <unk> , you &apos;re telling me , you &apos;re giving talks , you give talks to people to stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism for the first time , after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they ask me to say , &quot; no . say we grew up with that . &quot;
the age of terrorism went on , obviously , with <unk> and decades of rape and separation .
in this country , we have a dynamic where we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we haven &apos;t really understood what we &apos;ve done historically .
all the time i go around with each other .
we constantly create tensions and conflict .
it costs us to talk about races . i think it is because we &apos;re not prepared to engage with a real and reconciliation process .
in south africa , people understood that they couldn &apos;t overcome race <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation .
in rwanda , even before the genocide had this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t .
i was in germany giving talks about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s kind of disturbing to hear what you say . &quot;
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have a death penalty in germany .
we can &apos;t naturally have it here . &quot;
the room was silent and a lady said , &quot; there &apos;s no way for our history , we can never get into the systematic death of human beings .
it would be irrational that we , intentional and <unk> , would force us to run people . &quot;
tell us about this .
how would we feel in a world where a nation like germany , <unk> people , especially if they were in their jews ?
we couldn &apos;t tolerate it .
it would be irrational .
and yet , in this country , in the old @-@ south states , we keep running people . in the same areas where it &apos;s 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white , which if it were black , 22 times more likely to show if the <unk> is black and his <unk> is white in the same states that are buried .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
i think our identity is in danger .
if we don &apos;t really care about these issues as difficult , the positive and wonderful things are , yet , appreciate them .
we love innovation .
we &apos;re fascinated with technology . we worship creativity .
we love entertainment .
but lately , those realities are <unk> by suffering , abuse , degradation , <unk> .
in my opinion , we need to integrate both things .
we talk about the need to have more hope , more commitment , more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world .
i think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor , the <unk> , the people who never get to ted .
think about them is , in a sense , something that is inside of us .
it &apos;s true that we have to believe in issues that we haven &apos;t seen .
so we are . despite being so rational , so committed to intellectual .
with innovation , with creativity . development comes not just from brain ideas .
these things come from <unk> ideas , also by their heart convictions .
this connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look not only at the brilliant and dazzling , but also in the dark and the hard .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe suffering from oppression , we wanted all sorts of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , guidance for the spirit , a willingness to be in sites of despair and being witnesses . &quot;
well , that guidance for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what i believe , that even in communities like ted , you have to commit .
there is no disconnect related to technology and design , which allows us to truly be human if we don &apos;t attend to poverty , to <unk> , to inequality , to injustice .
now i want to warn you that these thoughts are much more challenging identity than if we neglect these things .
we go back to them .
i had the great privilege , being a very young lawyer , to meet <unk> .
she came to <unk> with some frequency , to come up with two of her closest friends , some older ladies , <unk> <unk> who had organized the bus <unk> , a wonderful lady , and virginia <unk> , a white lady , whose husband , <unk> , was dr. king &apos;s lawyer .
these women were just getting together to talk .
occasionally , the madame <unk> called me , to say , &quot; <unk> , the <unk> lady comes in . we &apos;re going to get together to speak .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; yes . yes i want . &quot;
so she said , &quot; well , what are you going to do when you came ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so , i went and i just listened to them .
it was very <unk> , very <unk> .
and on one occasion , i was there , listening to these ladies , and after a couple of hours , mrs. <unk> turned to me and said , &quot; now , <unk> , that &apos;s that idea of fairness .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and i started giving him my speech .
i said , &quot; well , we &apos;re trying to question injustice .
we &apos;re trying to help those who have been convicted .
we try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration .
we try to end sentences for life , without freedom from children .
we try to do something about death penalty .
we try to reduce the population in prisons .
we &apos;re trying to end with massive <unk> . &quot;
i gave him all my best speech and he finally looked at me and he said , &quot; hmm . &quot;
and he said , &quot; <unk> exhausted , very much . &quot;
at that time , ms. leaned in , he put my finger in his face , and he said , &quot; that &apos;s why you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
i think actually , the ted community has to be much more nuanced .
we have to find a way to deal with those challenges , those problems , that suffering .
because finally , humanity depends on compassion on others .
i &apos;ve learned some very simple things in my work .
i &apos;ve been studying simple things .
i &apos;ve come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than we &apos;ve made .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
i believe that if someone says a lie , it &apos;s not because he &apos;s a liar .
i &apos;m sure if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to it , it &apos;s not that a burglar .
even if someone kills another , it &apos;s not a killer .
so i think there &apos;s a basic dignity in people who have to be <unk> by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country and , surely , many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
that &apos;s not it .
i really think that many parts the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that although it &apos;s very dramatic , very beautiful , very <unk> , very inspiring , we will not be distracted by our technology , by our designs , not by our intellectual or rational ability .
ultimately , the character of a society , not because of the way the rich , powerful and privileged , but the way they treat the poor , the doomed , the prisoners .
because it &apos;s in this context as we begin to understand truly deep topics about what we are .
sometimes i feel <unk> . i &apos;m going to end with a story .
sometimes i make too much force .
getting tired , like everyone .
sometimes those ideas go further than my stories .
i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been tremendously <unk> .
i go to jail and i see my 13 @-@ and @-@ 14 @-@ year @-@ old clients who have been trafficked for adults .
and i start thinking , how can it be ?
how can a judge turn someone into what is not ?
judge <unk> him as an adult , but i see a child .
one night very late , i was thinking -- for god , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , you have to have magical powers .
<unk> , <unk> , the judge has magical powers .
you should ask some of that .
as i was too late , i couldn &apos;t think properly , but i started working on a <unk> .
i had a 14 @-@ year @-@ old client , a little , poor , black .
i started working on the <unk> , with a <unk> who said , &quot; <unk> for my 14 @-@ year @-@ old black client to be treated like a 75 @-@ year @-@ old , executive from a corporation . &quot;
in buddhism , i had to have been <unk> behavior in the accusation , in the behavior of the police and in the process .
there was a bold line about how in this country there is no ethics , but a whole lack of ethics .
the next morning , i woke up thinking , would that <unk> be a dream , or i really wrote it ?
for my horror , not only had it been <unk> , but he had been sent to court .
it was about two months , i had forgotten it .
and i finally decided -- god , i have to go to court for this stupid case .
i got in the car , and i felt really overwhelmed , overwhelmed .
i went in the car to the court .
i thought this would be very difficult and scary .
i finally got off the car . i was walking to the court .
i was going up the stairs when i found a big black man , and i was the <unk> of the court .
when he saw me , he approached me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; is he you a lawyer ? &quot; i said yes .
so i get tired and bored .
and i <unk> in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
i have to tell you now that was rude .
that connected deeply with my inner identity , with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope .
well , i went into the audience hall .
as he walked in , the judge saw me .
and he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you write this <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; mr. i was me . &quot; and we started discussing .
people started coming . they were all <unk> .
i was the one who had written these crazy things .
the police came in , the <unk> , the <unk> .
suddenly , not knowing how , the room was full of people . they were all upset because we were talking about races , because we were talking about poverty , because we were talking about inequality .
with the <unk> of my eye , i saw the <unk> going and came .
i was looking out the window , and i was going to hear all that <unk> .
he was still walking over here and there .
finally , this old black man , with his face of concern , came into the room and sat behind me , almost at the table of lawyers .
about 10 minutes later , the judge was going to hold a <unk> .
during the break , an assistant at the <unk> was shown because the <unk> had gone into the room .
the assistant <unk> over the old black .
and he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the audience room ? &quot;
and the old black man stood up , looked at the assistant , looked at me and said , &quot; i went into this audience hall to tell this young woman to keep her eyes on the side . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted today because i think a lot of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big , but it folds up into justice .
we can &apos;t be truly human @-@ centric if we don &apos;t care about human rights and by dignity .
our survival is tied up to others .
that our visions of technology , design , entertainment and creativity have to <unk> and <unk> and justice .
and above all , those of us here who share this , i just want to tell you that they keep your sight in the <unk> objective .
thank you very much .
you &apos;ve just heard , and you see an obvious desire from the audience , this community , to help in your purposes , to do something .
something that &apos;s not a check . what can we do ?
there are several near opportunities .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there will be a <unk> of this spring in which there will be an effort to fund the funds that are now spending in blame policies .
for example , here in california , a billion dollars is going to spend on the death penalty in the next five years . a billion dollars .
and despite this , 46 percent of the cases of <unk> in jail .
56 percent of the rapes come nowhere .
here &apos;s a change opportunity .
this <unk> is going to propose that these funds are encouraged to make law play , security .
i think there &apos;s a very close opportunity .
there &apos;s been a huge spike in crime in the united states , in the last three decades .
part of the explanation , it &apos;s said that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk> .
what would you say to those who believe it is ?
actually , the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable .
the big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes of violence .
it &apos;s the wrong war with drugs .
that &apos;s why this dramatic rise in the <unk> population .
and we &apos;re told by the rhetoric of the punishment .
we have three legal causes to bring people to life for life , for stealing a bicycle , for small crimes of property , rather than getting those resources into their victims .
i think we have to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less .
i think our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone .
i think that &apos;s the guidance that has to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve been excited to be here today .
you &apos;re very inspiring .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
<unk> : they grow the threats for the death of bin laden .
<unk> 2 : a drug in somalia . the police gives o.c. spray .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> posters . five : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : social <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> of tsunami . 9 : 30 <unk> .
several <unk> : war for drug destruction . mass destruction .
recession . it fails . end trial . egypt . syria .
crisis : death . disaster .
oh , my god !
these are just some of the clips i got in the last six months . you might be just the last six days or the last six years .
the idea is that press media prefer negative news , because our minds are paying attention .
and that answers to a very good reason .
in every second of every day , our senses are getting a lot more data than probably the brain can process .
and because we don &apos;t care more about survival , the first stop of all of these data is an old segment of the temporal lobe .
the amygdala is our early warning detector , the danger detector .
it <unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us .
so , from a <unk> of <unk> stories , looking at negative stories .
that old adage in the press , &quot; if there &apos;s blood , it sells , &quot; is very true .
and because all digital devices provide us with negative news every seven days of the week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not surprising that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not surprising that people think the world &apos;s going from bad to worse .
but maybe not .
perhaps , instead , what happens is we actually get <unk> .
perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades .
i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our good problems : climate change , species extinction , water scarcity and energy ; we certainly have them .
as human beings , we &apos;re very good at solving the problems and , in the long run , we &apos;ve just come up with them .
so let &apos;s look at what &apos;s happened in the last century to see where we &apos;re going .
in the last hundred years , the average of life has been more than doubled , the average per capita income for inflation has all over the world .
child mortality has reduced 10 times .
furthermore , the cost of food , electricity , transportation and communications , has fallen 10 to 1,000 times .
steve pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful times in human history .
and charles graffiti that global literacy has gone from 25 to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we &apos;re actually living an extraordinary time .
a lot of people forget it .
and we continue to have higher expectations .
in fact , we <unk> the meaning of poverty .
think about it , today in america , most of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity , water , refrigerators , refrigerators , tv , mobile , air conditioning and cars .
the rubber <unk> of the last century , the <unk> of the planet would never have dreamed of such luxury .
supporting a lot of this is technology and , lately , its exponential growth .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve , moore &apos;s law , and double the price performance over 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the cell phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
it &apos;s moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
i want you to look at two things on this curve .
first , what &apos;s soft -- in good and bad times , in war and in peace , in recession , in depression and booming .
it &apos;s the end of fast computers that we use to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t stop at all big challenges .
and even though he &apos;s stuck in a law on the left , the curve goes up .
the growth rate of technology is actually faster and faster .
and on this curve , moore &apos;s law , there &apos;s a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today .
the computation in the cloud , which my friends from autodesk call infinite computation , sensors and networks , robotics , 3d printing and its capacity to democratize and distributed personalized production throughout the planet , synthetic biology , drugs , vaccines , digital medicine , digital medicine , <unk> and artificial medicine .
i mean , how many of you saw the victory in &quot; jeopardy , &quot; from ibm ?
it was epic .
i looked in the newspapers the best headline i would have .
and i love this one : &quot; watson <unk> to human players . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy is not an easy game .
play with the nuances of human language .
imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud , available for everyone in the cell .
four years ago , here at ted , ray kurzweil and i , launched a new university called <unk> university .
we teach these technologies to our students , and in particular , how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we have them release a company , or a product or service , that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade .
think about that , the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people .
30 years ago , that would have absurd .
we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done this .
when i think about creating abundance , it doesn &apos;t mean to create life that is <unk> for every single planet -- it &apos;s about creating a life of the possible .
it &apos;s about taking that which is scarce and making it plentiful .
you see , scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
it &apos;s a story of napoleon in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited dinner the king of <unk> .
the troops were eating covered with silver , and the same napoleon , with gold <unk> .
but the king of <unk> , ate covered in aluminum .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet ; it was worth more than gold and platinum .
that &apos;s why the tip of the washington rescue is aluminum .
you see , even though aluminum is <unk> percent of the mass of the earth , it doesn &apos;t come as pure metal .
it &apos;s tied up for oxygen and <unk> .
but then the <unk> came in and made it out of aluminum something as cheap as we use it as if it were <unk> .
it <unk> this analogy towards the future .
let &apos;s think about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re on a planet , bathed 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
they come to earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 .
it &apos;s not scarcity ; it &apos;s <unk> .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , the cost of solar energy in india is 50 percent less than the fuel @-@ generated : <unk> versus 17 .
the cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year .
last month , the mit ran a study that showed that at the end of the decade , in the <unk> parts of the united states , solar electricity will be six cents an hour compared to 15 cents of the national average .
and if we have plenty of energy , we also have plenty of water .
now , let &apos;s talk about wars over water .
do you remember when carl sagan pointed the voyager spacecraft to the earth , in 1990 , after saturn happened ?
he took a very famous picture . what was he called ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet covered 70 percent by water .
yes , <unk> percent is salt water , two percent is ice , and we fight for half percent of the water on the planet , but here &apos;s also a hope .
it &apos;s a technology that &apos;s available not 10 or 20 years , but right now .
nanotechnology comes with <unk> .
in a conversation with dean kamen this morning , one of the innovators in the <unk> -- i &apos;d like to share with you , he gave me permission to do this -- his technology called <unk> -- is the size of a small refrigerator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water a day of any salt source , polluted water , a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon .
the ceo of coca @-@ cola has just shown that it will do an important test of hundreds of units in the developing world .
if that comes well , and i have a full confidence that it will be , coke will globally , globally , globally , global countries .
this is an <unk> innovation by this technology that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen it in mobile phones .
oh my god , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent of the drivers of mobile in the developing world for the end of 2013 .
think about it , that ephemeral warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of kenya than president reagan 25 years ago .
and , having a smartphone with google , it has access to more knowledge and information that president clinton 15 years ago .
he lives in a world of abundance of information and communication that no one could ever have predicted .
better than that , the things that you and i have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video , armed images , libraries of books and music , diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones .
maybe the best comes when health care applications come .
last month , i had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> foundation something called the <unk> x prize , 10 million dollars .
we &apos;re challenging the equipment in the world to combine these technologies into a mobile device that you &apos;re talking about , and since you have ai , you can get blood out of your finger .
to win , it has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team .
imagine this device in the developing world in which there are no doctors , where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent , and there are 1.3 percent of health workers .
when this device <unk> a rna or dna virus that doesn &apos;t recognize , it will be called in the fda of health , and , first of all , it will make the pandemic happen .
but this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance .
i call it the billion increasing .
the white lines over here are the population .
we just went through seven billion .
by the way , the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health .
in 2010 , we had less than two billion people online , connected .
by 2020 , it will happen two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion minds never before add up to the global conversation .
what do these people want ?
what are you doing ? what wishes you have ?
and instead of an economic collapse , we have the greatest economic injection of history .
these people represent tens of billions of dollars in global economics .
and more health research thanks to the <unk> , a better education with the khan and because of the use of 3d impressions and cloud computation will be more productive than ever before .
what can give us 3,000 billion more members of humanity , healthy , productive ?
what about some voices never before ?
what if we give them to the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time ?
what are these three billion ?
what if they &apos;re contributions we cannot predict ?
something that i learned with the x prize is that small teams , led by their passion with a clear goal , can do extraordinary things , things that could only do big things , corporations and governments .
i &apos;m going to end by sharing a story that really got me excited .
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
it &apos;s called foldit .
he came up at the university of washington , in seattle .
it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein behaves .
the folds determine the structure and the functionality .
it &apos;s a very important thing in medical research .
and , until now , it was a problem of supercomputers .
they &apos;ve played with this college professors , among others .
then hundreds of thousands of people came in and they started playing it .
and it &apos;s been shown today that the human @-@ pattern recognition machinery is better protein than the best computers .
and these people looked for the best protein <unk> in the world , and they didn &apos;t teach at mit , and i was not teaching at caltech ; it was a person in england , in manchester , a woman who , during the day , was a ceo artist worker at a rehabilitation clinic , and at night , was the best <unk> of proteins in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in the future is that we now have more power as people to take the grand challenges of the planet .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
we have the passion of <unk> .
we have <unk> capital .
and we have 3,000 billion new minds that are encouraged to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do .
we have for a few very extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i don &apos;t think we need to do something with some of the medical culture that needs to change .
and i think this starts with a doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and i &apos;ve spent enough time on my fake prestige about that .
before i try the theme of my talk , let &apos;s talk a little bit about baseball .
why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , the world cup walks .
we love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of amazing statistics .
there are hundreds of statistics .
it &apos;s about to go out &quot; <unk> the rules , &quot; speaks about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team .
i get into one of them , and i hope a lot of you know it .
it &apos;s called the average <unk> .
and we talk about 300 , of a <unk> that <unk> 300 .
that means that <unk> is effectively three out of 10 times .
that means throwing the ball into the playing field without being caught , and anyone who &apos;s trying to throw it out at the first base , doesn &apos;t get there in time , and the second base will be <unk> .
three attempts at 10 .
do you know how they call a 300 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> ?
well , really good , maybe of the team of stars .
do you know what they call a 400 @-@ year baseball <unk> ?
by the way , that &apos;s someone who , 10 taps , gets it four .
legendary -- like the great ted williams , the last player from the <unk> league of <unk> to execute more 400 strikes in a regular season .
now , i &apos;m going to link this to my world of medicine where i feel much more comfortable , or maybe less uncomfortable , after what i &apos;m going to tell you today .
suppose they have <unk> and they &apos;re derivatives of a surgeon who also have a 400 @-@ year record of <unk> .
that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
now suppose you live in a remote place , and a loved one has two coronary arteries , and your family doctor <unk> it to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 .
but , you know something ?
she &apos;s dramatically improving this year .
and his <unk> have been <unk> .
this is not working .
but i &apos;ll tell you .
what do you think it has to be the average <unk> of a heart surgeon or orthopedic surgeon , of a nurse or a thousand , very well .
and the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the <unk> of a good surgeon or a doctor or a <unk> .
what we do , however , is we serve the world , and i include myself , with the mandate of being perfect .
that never , ever , would make a mistake and make sure how to do it well .
that was the message that i was born when i was in medical college .
i was a obsessive student .
once , a fellow in high school said that brian goldman sachs studied to a blood test .
maybe .
i studied in my little <unk> , in the nursing residence at general university in toronto , not far from here .
and i learned all kinds of memory .
from my kind of anatomy , taking the origin and the muscle work , the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the aorta , the shared differential and the rare .
and i even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify kidney <unk> .
and as long as we gather more and more knowledge .
and i went very well ; i graduated with <unk> .
and getting rid of the medical school with the impression that if you knew everything , then you would know everything , or as close as possible , close to everything , because that &apos;s how i get tired of mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met the madame <unk> .
i was a resident at a university hospital here in toronto , when they brought the lady into the emergency service where i worked .
at the time , i was welcomed in cardiology .
and when emergencies requested a cardiologist to go and attend that patient .
and it inform the boss of residents .
when i saw the madame <unk> , i was <unk> .
i heard a <unk> sound .
and when i rescued it , i heard a sound <unk> on both sides , which told me a heart failure .
in these conditions , the heart stops working , and instead of injecting the blood into the lung , the blood goes into the lungs , they fill in the blood , and that &apos;s why there &apos;s difficulty breathing .
and it wasn &apos;t hard to diagnose .
i did , and i started working on the treatment i would give .
i gave him aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart .
i gave him <unk> , water pills , so he could remove a liquid .
and in an hour or two , she started feeling better .
and i felt really good .
and that &apos;s when i made the first mistake , i sent her home .
i actually made two more mistakes .
i sent her home without talking to the chief of residents .
i didn &apos;t get up the phone , and i didn &apos;t do what i should have done , which was to call my boss , and have a look at it .
and if my boss would have seen it , it would have been able to provide eye @-@ ownership information .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a resident that would open attention .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility , that i could take care of my patients without even reaching my boss .
the second mistake i made was worse .
when i send her home , i don &apos;t pay attention to a voice in my inner world saying , &quot; goldman sachs , it &apos;s not a good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , he was so insecure that i even asked the nurse who was taking care of the lady , &quot; do you think he &apos;s okay if he &apos;s going home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought , and then she said with total <unk> : &quot; yes , i think it will be okay . &quot;
i remember that as it was yesterday .
so , i signed the high , and the ambulance next to the residents drove her home .
and i went back to the hospital room .
the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had a bad <unk> in the stomach .
but i did follow my work .
at the end of the day , i walked up to leave the hospital and i walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home . i did something i don &apos;t normally do .
i went through the service of <unk> home .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not the one who was taking care of the lady before , but another . she told me three words , those three words that most emergency physicians fear .
other specialists who are also afraid of it , but there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> , and that is that we see patients from waiting .
the three words are : does it remember you ?
&quot; does it remember the patient who sent his home ? &quot;
he asked the other nurse with total <unk> .
&quot; well , she came back , &quot; with the same voice tone .
she was fine .
but he went back and on the brink of death .
after an hour of having arrived at his house , after i gave him the high , he suffered a collapse and his family called 911 , and the ambulance brought him to emergencies with a 50 @-@ millimeter blood pressure of <unk> , which means severe .
i was barely breathing and blue .
the emergency staff will save all their resources .
they gave him medication to raise blood pressure .
and they put an artificial <unk> .
i was <unk> and <unk> to the marrow .
he had a mix of feelings , because after he got it in intense therapy and he hoped against all the hope that he would get tired .
and in the next two or three days , it was evident that they never cooked .
he had a permanent brain damage .
the family came together .
and in eight or nine days , they were joining what was happening .
and on the ninth day , they let her go . the madame <unk> , wife and grandmother .
they say they never forget the names of those who die .
that was my first experience .
the next few weeks , i was fascinated by that , and i experienced for the very first time the shame that exists in our medical culture , and i felt just isolated , not feeling that healthy embarrassment because you can &apos;t relate to your colleagues .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , your friend comes up and you have a terrible discussion , but in the end , that nasty feeling is your guide and you can admit that you never make that mistake .
you make peace and you never make that mistake .
it &apos;s that shame that leaves a teaching .
the shame of what i &apos;m talking about is what makes us feel very bad inside .
it &apos;s the one who tells us not that what we did was bad , but we &apos;re bad .
and that felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for my boss ; he was a <unk> .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he <unk> things and <unk> that i won &apos;t get tired .
and i kept getting those questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask my boss ? why did i send her home ?
and in my worst moments , why did i make such a dumb error ?
why did i choose medicine ?
little bit of that feeling was <unk> .
and i started feeling better .
and on a rainy day , the sky opened and finally the sun came out , and i wondered if i &apos;d feel better again .
and i did a deal with myself in which , if i gave the efforts to be perfect in order not to make more mistakes , i would cheat those voices .
and that was it .
i went back to work .
but he went back .
two years later , i was an assistant at the emergency department in a community hospital in northern toronto , and i got a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man with a pain in his throat .
i was very busy .
and he &apos;s here .
i watched his throat , he was kind of angry .
i gave him penicillin and i sent him to his house .
but while he was running at the door , he was still pointing his throat .
two days later , when i came to make my seat change , my boss asked me to talk to me about his office .
and he made the three words : does it remember you ?
do you recall the patient who saw from a pain in his throat ?
so he went back and he didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
he had a potentially fatal condition called <unk> .
you can search it for google . it &apos;s an infection , not your throat , but from the upper air route , and it can cause the closing of those roads .
he , fortunately , he did not die .
he <unk> antibiotics through <unk> , and he escaped the few days .
and i stepped back from the same period of shame and <unk> , then moved back and forth to work , until it happened over and over again , and again .
twice at the same emergency rate , <unk> <unk> .
and it &apos;s a great effort , especially working in a hospital , because it &apos;s 14 patients at the same time .
but in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s been a <unk> .
one of them thought i had a kidney calculus .
he downloaded an x @-@ ray of kidneys , but it turned out to be normal -- a colleague that was looking at the patient -- he was looking at some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant and called the surgeon .
the other patient was with a lot of diarrhea .
i gave him a liquid <unk> , and i asked my colleague to write it to him .
he checked , and when he noticed some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant , he called the surgeon .
both of these were operated and they recovered well .
but every case i get tired , i get scared .
but i would like to tell you that i made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise , and as many colleagues say , it &apos;s crap .
the most significant have been over the last five years .
only , shame and no support .
and here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t go back and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the <unk> that tells me what really happens , how can i share this with my colleagues ?
how do i teach them this so that they don &apos;t make the same mistakes ?
if i now went into a place like this , i would have no idea what you think of .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failing , after failure , after failure ?
of course , at a party , you &apos;ll hear about the errors of other physicians , but you won &apos;t hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
if i could now go into a room full of colleagues , if i asked them for support and tell them what i just told you , i would not have to come to the second story without the fact that before they started <unk> , someone would make a joke , they would change and they would follow .
and if i knew and my colleagues too , that a <unk> in my hospital would spit the wrong leg , believe that i would have difficulties in the eyes .
this is the system we have .
complete denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s the system in which there are two positions : those who make mistakes and those who can &apos;t sleep and those who can do ; those who have lousy results and those who have great results .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like antibodies that start attacking that person .
we have the idea that if we don &apos;t step away from medicine to people who make mistakes , we will stay in a safe system .
but that brings two problems .
in 20 years , approximately the spread and medical journalism , i have done a staff of bad medical abuse and medical errors to learn what can be possible , from the first paper i wrote for the star toronto , to my program , &quot; white plains , art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous .
we work in a system where mistakes happen every single day , where one out of 10 drugs in the hospital is wrong , or <unk> is not right . in a system in which <unk> infections are increasingly , and more numerous , causing chaos and death .
in this country , they die 24 thousand canadian errors .
the u.s. medical institute set up 100,000 .
in both cases , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re not <unk> the problem as we should .
and so there are things .
a holistic system where knowledge exploded every two or three years , and we don &apos;t get distracted .
sleep deprivation is <unk> .
and we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect history of a patient with pain in their chest .
now , let &apos;s take the same patient with a chest pain , and it comes <unk> with eyes and with breath for alcohol and , all of a sudden , my story <unk> .
it &apos;s not the same story .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars . they &apos;re not taking their symptoms forever .
all over this , mistakes are inevitable .
so , if we take the system like we were taught , and we removed all of the <unk> of error , well , no one will stay .
and what about it that people don &apos;t want to talk about their very serious cases ?
in my program , &quot; <unk> black , black art , &quot; now it &apos;s a custom to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; i would tell all of you , from the ambulance to the head of cardiac surgery : &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah -- what are your mistakes ? &quot; and get the microphone into them .
and his students would be beaten , <unk> , <unk> his head and <unk> , and start to tell his stories .
they want to tell their stories , they want to share them .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake . &quot;
they need a context where we can do it .
they need a medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor every time .
doctor terry is human ; you know human ; you accept it , and you don &apos;t enjoy your mistakes , but you try to learn what &apos;s happened to teach others .
they share their experiences with them .
it &apos;s support for those who talk about their mistakes .
points out the mistakes of other people , not with the intent of <unk> , but in a way of loving and support so that everyone <unk> .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are running the system , and when this happens , they make mistakes once in a while .
but the system is evolving to create <unk> that will allow you to spot in a simple way those mistakes that inevitably make humans , and also promote support and love , spaces from where what you can see in the healthcare system , you can find potential errors and be rewarded for that , particularly people like me , so that we can make mistakes for them .
my name is brian goldman sachs .
i &apos;m a christian doctor .
i &apos;m human , i make mistakes .
and i &apos;m so sorry , but i &apos;m hard to learn something that can convey to others .
i don &apos;t know what they think about me yet , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three personal words : i remember it .
i &apos;m going to talk about a very small idea .
the <unk> of the starting point .
and as the idea can be explained in a minute , i &apos;ll give you three examples to make time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
he was here , you know , in <unk> .
they probably think they &apos;re <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t .
he actually would pick fish .
and he described one of them as very common .
it was just pure .
they were sweating a lot to the 1880 decade .
now the fish is in the red list red list .
but we &apos;ve heard this story a lot of times , about galapagos and elsewhere , so that has nothing special .
but the thing is , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re <unk> .
the <unk> still say it &apos;s intact .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
the second story , also illustrates another concept : the shifting of the waist .
because i was there in 1971 studying a lagoon in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe and then i wanted to work in africa .
i thought it could be wrong .
i was very pleased with the sun , and i was convinced that i wasn &apos;t there .
this is my first exhibition in the sun .
the lagoon was surrounded by <unk> , and , as you can see , a few mangroves .
there were about 20 inches , black beard <unk> .
and the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and it was for a good time , so it would win more than half in ghana .
when i was there 27 years later , the number of fish had fallen in half .
he went to five inches .
they experienced a genetic pressure .
there were still fish .
in a way , they were still happy .
and the fish were still happy to be there .
i mean , nothing changed , but everything has changed .
my third story is , i was introduced in the introduction of <unk> fishing in southeast asia .
in the 1970s , well , it started in europe &apos;s <unk> did a lot of development projects .
development <unk> was encouraging countries that had 100,000 fishermen , preserving the industrial fisheries .
and this boat , quite ugly , was called the <unk> 4 .
i went out and fishing in him , and we did studies in the south of the china sea and , above all , in the java sea .
what we captured there was something <unk> .
we capture , now i know , sea bottom .
ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> , other animals that are in the background .
and most of the fishes are tiny spots on some remains , remains that are coral reefs .
in short , the sea bottom came to the covered , and then it was <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary because transition is very fast .
in a year , you do a study and then you start commercial fishing .
the background is coming from being a solid coral background , in this case , to be a <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat them . they didn &apos;t eat them because they were dead .
we once captured a living .
i was still not shy .
so they wanted to eat it because it was a good food .
this mountain of remains is what fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they never have fish .
but it &apos;s not documented .
we turn the world , but we don &apos;t remember .
he was taking the starting point , the new level , not remembering what was there .
if you look at this , something like this .
on the y @-@ axis , we have good things : biodiversity , the number of killer whales , the <unk> of the country , the water supply .
and that changes over time . it changes because people do things with sadness .
every generation is going to use images , given up at the beginning of their conscious life like normal and <unk> them forward .
the difference is that they experience loss .
but they don &apos;t perceive the loss that happened before .
you can analyze the set of changes .
and in the end , it keeps some <unk> .
and that , largely , is what we want to do now .
we want to keep things that aren &apos;t , or they &apos;re not what they were .
but you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies kill animals without knowing what they &apos;ve done to a few generations later .
because , obviously , an animal that &apos;s very abundant , before they go extinct , it &apos;s rare .
you don &apos;t lose abundant animals .
you lose small animals .
even if this doesn &apos;t feel like a big loss .
over time , we focus on big animals , and a sea synonymous with big fish .
they become unusual because the <unk> .
over time , we have a few fish , but we think that &apos;s the starting point .
and the question is , why do we accept this ?
well , we don &apos;t know it was different .
in fact , a lot of people , scientists , would argue that it was very different .
and they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not the way they would expect evidence to be .
for example , the anecdote that some of them show , as such as a captain and just looked at a lot of fish in this area can &apos;t be used or , generally , they don &apos;t use fishing scientists , because it &apos;s not scientific .
so , we have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in civilized societies , because they don &apos;t rely on the sources of the past .
that &apos;s the huge piece of paper that can accomplish a protected marine area .
because with marine protected areas , we actually re @-@ create the past .
we re @-@ create the past that people can &apos;t think of because the starting point has gone and is extremely low .
that &apos;s for the people who can see a protected marine zone and can benefit from vision that provides , which allows them to delete their starting point .
and what about the people who can &apos;t do it because they have no access , like the people in the west , for example ?
i think the arts and film can probably fill in the vacuum ; the simulation .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago there were gray whales in chesapeake bay , 500 years ago .
and you may have noticed that the nuances and the <unk> are like &quot; avatar &quot; .
and if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were excited by the movie , i was talking about the story of <unk> , why would you interact with images ?
because it raises something that , in a sense , has been lost .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is cameron , &quot; avatar , &quot; under the water .
thank you very much .
in the &apos; 80s , in the eastern communist germany , if you had a typewriter machine , you should write it to the government .
you had to register a piece of text for example written with the machine .
and this so that the government could track the origin of texts .
if they found a written with the wrong message , they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea .
in the west , we don &apos;t think that someone could do this , how much this would make freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our countries .
but today , in 2011 , if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer and prints a page , that page will end up having some yellow dots on every page that follow a pattern that makes them one and a printer .
that &apos;s happening to us today .
and nobody seems a lot about this .
this is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us , citizens .
and it &apos;s one of the three main causes of problems in the network .
if we look at what happens in the online world , we can set up the attacks according to their attackers .
there are three major groups .
there are the <unk> .
like mr. <unk> &apos;s city of <unk> , in ukraine .
the <unk> cell is very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use cyber weapons to make a lot of money , enormous amounts .
there are actually a lot of phone calls , <unk> , <unk> dollars with their attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> , of estonia , .
this is alfred <unk> .
this is stephen hansen .
this is <unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> al @-@ <unk> and so on and so on .
these guys are doing their <unk> online , but they &apos;re doing it for illegal means using <unk> banking to steal money from our bills when we buy money online , or they &apos;re stealing our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer infected computer .
the secret service of america , two months ago , we <unk> the swiss account of this man , sam jain , and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain <unk> : his <unk> .
and i say that today is more likely than any of us to be a victim of a real crime .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this goes from bad to worse .
in the future , most crimes will come online .
the second group of attackers in importance that we see today is not motivated by the money .
there &apos;s another thing that moves them , and they motivate the protests , they motivate their opinions , they motivate them into laughter .
groups like <unk> have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a leading role in online attacks .
those are the three leading attackers : the criminals who do it for money , the <unk> as <unk> , who do it to <unk> and the last group are national states that attack .
and then we see cases like <unk> .
that &apos;s a good example of government attack against its own citizens .
<unk> is an authority of the netherlands , or indeed , it was .
he declared bankrupt the last fall because of a <unk> .
he <unk> the safety of the site and <unk> a <unk> .
last week i asked , at a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders if they were to <unk> the death of people because of the attack <unk> .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die because of a attack of these ?
<unk> is an illegitimate authority .
they sell a certificate .
what do the certificate for ?
well , you need , if you have a website with <unk> , services like <unk> , services like switch .
now all of us , or almost all of us , use gmail or some of their competitors , but these services are very popular in political states like iran where dissidents , as they know that they are more reliable than local services , and they &apos;re embedded in connections so the local government can &apos;t stand up their discussions .
unless you give a foreign authority .
and he <unk> <unk> .
and in the <unk> case that happened exactly .
and what happened in the arab spring and these things that have happened , for example , in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the protesters who entered the egyptian police headquarters in april 2011 , and during the <unk> of the building , they found a lot of papers .
amongst those papers was this folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and inside that folder , there were notes from a company that was based in germany , that had sold the egyptian tools to intercept the great scale of the communications of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company &apos;s headquarters are right here .
i mean , western governments provide tools for governments to make this happen to their citizens .
but western governments also do this themselves .
for example , in germany , only a couple of weeks ago was found <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a good criminal case , it &apos;s quite obvious that your phone is <unk> .
but today it goes further .
the internet connection is connected .
they use even tools like <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all of the communication , and listen to online arguments , to get our data .
when we think about things like this , the obvious answer should be , &quot; well , it sounds bad , but it really doesn &apos;t affect me because i &apos;m an honest citizen .
why worry ?
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s in the game of privacy .
privacy is not arguing .
it &apos;s not a question of privacy versus security .
it &apos;s about freedom versus control .
now , if we could rely on our governments today in 2011 , any right now that we are going to be forever .
in any future government , in an administration that we could have within 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to worry about the next 50 years .
this may seem strange , but i &apos;m a huge <unk> of the concrete block .
the first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea : cement modules of a fixed that fit together .
very quickly , these became the most used construction unit in the world .
they &apos;ve allowed us to build bigger things than us , like buildings or bridges , a brick at a time .
essentially , these blocks have become the pillars of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , to <unk> , this happened .
he was called the automatic assembly brick .
and within a few years , the <unk> bricks arrived at all the homes .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges , buildings or homes .
lego made it accessible .
lego just embraced the concrete block , the favorite in the world , and made it a fundamental piece of our imagination .
meanwhile , exactly that same year , in bell labs , the next revolution was about to say , the new building block .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of bricks that would take a few more to a world where everything was interactive .
just like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to create much bigger and more complex circuits , a brick at a time .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts , so i decided to change it .
eight years ago , when i was in the media lab , i started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers into the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
i &apos;m going to show you how they work .
<unk> are electronics each and a specific function .
they are empowered to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
and the best part of it is that they unite through magnets .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
the bricks have a code of colors .
the green is the output , the blue is the stream , the pink is the input and the orange one is the wire .
so you only have to assemble a blue with a green one , and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits .
a green blue with a green light .
we can put a button in the middle , so we have a regulator probe .
if we change the button for a pulse module , which is here , and now we have a light that &apos;s <unk> .
we add this <unk> to create more impact , and we have a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop this .
so beyond the simple game , <unk> are actually very powerful .
instead of having to program , connecting and self @-@ centered , it allows us to program very simple intuitive gestures .
to make you blink faster or slower , you simply turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing collection .
we want all the interactions in the world to go into smart bricks that are ready to use .
lights , sounds , solar panels ; everything has to be accessible .
we &apos;ve given the kids to watch them play with them .
and it &apos;s been an amazing experience .
the cool thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics of every day you don &apos;t learn in schools .
for example , how does a light night work , or why the door of an elevator is kept open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also taken <unk> to design schools .
so , for example , designers without any experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material .
here you can see , with paper bottles and <unk> , we have <unk> .
a few weeks ago , we took <unk> to the designers of rhode island school of design , which have no experience in engineering , and we put them in cardboard , wood and we said , &quot; do something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they &apos;ve done , a cannon by motion .
but wait , here comes my favorite project .
it &apos;s a locust that is made of play @-@ doh that he &apos;s afraid of the darkness .
for these not engineers , <unk> became another material , electronics became another material .
and we want this stuff to reach everyone .
so , <unk> has open source .
you can visit the website , download all the design files and throw it away .
we want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators because this world we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so go ahead and invent .
thank you .
