one day , the l.a. times <unk> was walking across the street in los angeles , when she listened to a beautiful music .
she came from a man , a very lovely , hardworking man , without home , playing a violin that only had two strings .
i &apos;m telling you a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s column was the basis for a book that then became a film , with robert <unk> , acting like steve <unk> and jamie <unk> , who was trained in <unk> whose fabulous race was <unk> by a tragic <unk> of schizophrenia .
nathaniel <unk> , he suffered a complete and 30 years later he was living on the streets of skid row in the center of los angeles .
i encourage you to read the book by steve or look at the film to understand not only the beautiful bond created between these two guys , but how music helped form that link , and finally played a decisive role to help nathaniel out of the street .
i met the lord <unk> in 2008 , two years ago on the walt disney <unk> .
he had just heard an interpretation of the first and fourth symphony by beethoven and came backstage .
i was speaking of a very <unk> and social form about myself and <unk> and hillary clinton and how the dodgers never would come to the world series , all because of the performance of the first violin on the last beethoven movement .
and we talked about music . and a few days later , i got an email from steve saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , i should mention that nathaniel denies to the treatment , because when he was treated by law therapy , <unk> and wives , and that scar has remained in him all his life .
but as a result now , it &apos;s prone to these episode , the worse pictures can be matched with it and then <unk> by days , <unk> by the streets of skid row , exposed to their <unk> , with the <unk> of his own mind without control .
and nathaniel was in such a state of <unk> when we started our first lesson in the walt disney <unk> , who had a kind of flash <unk> in his eyes , he was lost .
and he talked about invisible demons and smoke , and how somebody was sleeping it as they slept .
and i felt afraid , not for me , but i was afraid that i was going to lose her , that i was going to sink in one of her states and that i would challenge her relationship with the violin if i started talking about scale and <unk> and other ways of pedagogy .
so i just started playing .
and i touched the first move from the concert to beethoven .
and as i touched , a profound shift was happening in nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was like i was under control of some invisible drugs , a chemical reaction , for which i played music was its catalyst .
and nathaniel <unk> &apos;s cholera became understood , in a sit curiosity and in grace .
and as a miracle , he raised his own violin , and he began to touch some sound bits for a violin , which then asked me to perform , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started talking about music , from bach all up until beethoven and brahms , all the <unk> , all the way from bartok , all the way down to that <unk> .
and i understood that he not only had a <unk> knowledge of music , but he <unk> with this music at a personal level .
he talked about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues at the l.a. philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this guy became part of this paranoid man , who had come from walking across the streets of los angeles , the lovely scholar , brilliant , educated musician @-@ playing .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for nathaniel &apos;s music , it &apos;s <unk> .
because music lets him take his thoughts and his delusions and transform through his imagination and his creativity in reality .
and this is an escape from its <unk> state .
and i understood that this was the same essence of art .
this was the real reason that we make music , that we take something that exists within all of us , in our true essence , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we are able to transform those emotions in reality .
and the reality of that expression hits all of us , it <unk> us , it inspires us and ties us .
and for nathaniel , the music brought him back to the family of friends .
the <unk> power of music came back to the family of musicians who understood it , who recognized their talents and spread it .
and i will always make music with nathaniel , whether you &apos;re on the walt disney <unk> , or on skid row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that without some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
so please excuse me .
so i &apos;ve known many fish in my life .
i &apos;ve only loved two .
the first one , it was more like a passionate romance .
it was a beautiful , tasty fish , with texture , a willing to be eaten in the menu .
fish .
even better , he was raised allegedly by the high @-@ tech <unk> .
so you could feel good at selling it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , he called the chief of the company and he asked if i would speak at an event on the sustainability of the <unk> .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve this problem for our chefs that had been unimaginable about -- as we kept on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we fishing in the seas in the same way that we planted our forests .
it &apos;s hard to exaggerate destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the salmon , all collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for good or for evil , for fishes , will be part of our future .
there are many arguments against it . fish <unk> , at least most of them do , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take the example of tuna . a greater disadvantage .
it has a 15 @-@ to @-@ one food conversion .
this means that you need 15 pounds of wild fish to produce a kilogram of <unk> .
it &apos;s not very sustainable .
it &apos;s not very tasty either .
so here , finally , there was a company trying to do the right thing .
i wanted to support them .
day before the event , i called the pr superintendent of the company .
mister <unk> .
&quot; gift , &quot; i said , &quot; only to have the facts in clear , you are famous for raising so far seas inside , you don &apos;t pollute . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we are so far away , that the waste of our fish is distributed , you don &apos;t concentrate . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world in itself .
that food wave ? 2.5 to one , he said .
&quot; the best in the <unk> . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one that ? how are you feeding them ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> proteins , &quot; she told me .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . and i sent the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , right before the event , i called it mister .
i said , &quot; sir , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he told me i didn &apos;t know . i &apos;d say there .
well , i talked on the phone with some people in the company . nobody could give me a direct answer , until i finally spoke on the phone with the <unk> in charge .
let &apos;s call it mister <unk> too .
&quot; a gift , &quot; i said , &quot; what are these examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some food for fish , and then he said chicken pellets .
i said , &quot; change the chicken ? &quot;
he told me , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone , <unk> , <unk> and processed in food . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of the food is chicken ? &quot;
thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , who is sustainable to feed the fish ? &quot;
there was a long silence in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i was fed up with this fish .
no , not because it &apos;s some gourmet <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m actually .
no , i actually obsessed with this fish because , i swear to god , that after that conversation , the seafood had a taste of chicken .
the second seafood , it &apos;s another kind of love story .
the romantic guy , the guy you know the fish , the more you love the fish .
i ate it for the first time in a restaurant in the south spain .
a friend of mine was talking about this fish for a long time .
somehow she organized our first quote .
he came to the table of a white color , of course , and almost <unk> .
the chef had taken it on fire .
type two times more .
incredibly , it was just delicious .
<unk> can you make a fish equally rich after being so energized ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
call him michelangelo . actually his name <unk> , <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t <unk> the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way we understand it and i .
it &apos;s a biologist in the back .
it &apos;s a fish <unk> on the edge of spain .
it &apos;s at the end of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , the <unk> was in the hands of <unk> .
they were also saving cows in what they were essentially <unk> .
they did the land .
they built this <unk> series of canals , and confined water on land to the river .
well , they did not make it work , not in the economic way .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed something like 90 percent of the birds , which for a place like this , are many birds .
and then back in 1982 , a spanish company bought an environmental awareness .
what did they do ?
you reverse the flow of the water .
it literally <unk> the switch .
instead of pushing the water out , used the canals to attract the water into the inside .
we portray the channels .
they created a <unk> of <unk> @-@ acre fish -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and in the process , , michelangelo and his company <unk> the whole ecological destruction .
<unk> is incredible .
i mean , you never saw something like this .
you look at the horizon that &apos;s at a million miles away , and what you see is , it &apos;s <unk> channels and this <unk> and it &apos;s rich .
i was there not a long time ago with michelangelo .
it &apos;s an incredible guy , three charles darwin and a <unk> crocodile .
ok ? there we are <unk> by the <unk> , and i &apos;m <unk> and <unk> with mud at the height of our knees , and michelangelo is doing with a biology conference .
here &apos;s a black <unk> <unk> <unk> .
now , it &apos;s quote the mineral needs of the <unk> .
and here , here &apos;s a pattern of clustering that makes him remember the <unk> of tanzania .
it turns out that , michelangelo spent most of his career in national park in africa .
i asked him how he became an expert in fish .
he said , &quot; change ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i am an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then he starts talking again about bird and algae and weird plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the community was disconnected , out that kind of thing .
it &apos;s fantastic , but i was in love .
and my head was packed with that piece of delicious fish .
so i told her . i said , &quot; michelangelo , that makes your seafood so tasty ? &quot;
he showed me the algae .
&quot; i know , <unk> , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
what is the food conversion index ? &quot;
well , it starts telling me , it &apos;s such a rich system , that fish are eating what they eat in their natural <unk> .
the biomass of plants , the phytoplankton , kills the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s fully self @-@ renewable .
there &apos;s no food .
have you heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
later that day , i was driving with michelangelo around a property , and i said , &quot; for a place that looks so natural , different than any <unk> you &apos;ve ever seen , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that time , it was as if a movie conductor asked to change the stage .
and by bending in the corner , we saw the most incredible landscape , thousands and thousands of rose , literally a rose carpet .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; she said .
&quot; look at his <unk> , rose .
they &apos;re doing a <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , you &apos;re not doing a <unk> with your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , &quot; she told me .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our seafood and <unk> of the birds . <unk>
well , last year , this property had 600,000 <unk> over 250 different species .
it became today the largest one , and one of the most important bird <unk> all over europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; <unk> , a population of grasses is not the last thing you &apos;d like to have on your fish <unk> ? &quot;
it moved the head , &quot; no . &quot;
he said , &quot; we grew <unk> , not intensive .
this is an ecological network .
<unk> are eaten by shrimp .
the shrimp are eaten by phytoplankton .
so the more pink you have the womb is the system . &quot;
well , let &apos;s face it . a <unk> that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a <unk> that measures their success on the health of their predators .
a fish <unk> , but also a bird sanctuary .
oh , and by the way , those <unk> , in the first place you shouldn &apos;t be there .
in a village left 1,500 miles in which the land conditions are better to make nests .
every morning , they fly 150 miles up to <unk> .
and every evening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they keep track of the white highway <unk> .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i was imagining a kind of penguin march , so i looked at michelangelo .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , fly 150 miles up to <unk> , and then they fly 150 miles back to night ?
do you make that for your offspring ? &quot;
he looked at me as though he had just quoted a song by houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my well @-@ known fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t even like the seafood . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> .
that &apos;s <unk> taste , like tar .
i can hardly use it to cook .
however , when i photographed her in the south spain , she had nothing to do with a fish skin .
i had a taste of sweet and clean as if you were eating a sea <unk> .
i mentioned that to michelangelo and <unk> with your head .
he said , &quot; the skin <unk> like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something between the body .
it evolved to absorb <unk> . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
ok . a <unk> that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a <unk> that measures their success by their predators .
and then i realized when he says , a <unk> that doesn &apos;t have dysmorphophobia , made a huge understatement , because the water flowing through that <unk> comes from the <unk> river <unk> .
it &apos;s a river that <unk> all of the things that rivers often drag by using today , chemical pollutants , <unk> .
and when they &apos;re entering the system and they go , the water is cleaner than when they entered .
the system is so healthy that it <unk> the water .
so , not only one <unk> that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only one <unk> that measures their success on their predators , but a <unk> that is literally a water <unk> plant , and not only for those fish , but for you and for me as well .
because when the water withdraws , they <unk> into the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should also pick it up , because this love story , although romantic , is also educational .
you might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of food , that we &apos;re talking about brussels or beef .
what we need now is a radically different conception of agriculture , in which food actually is tasty .
but for many people , that &apos;s too radical .
we &apos;re not realistic to us ; we &apos;re <unk> lovers .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love small families . we talk about local food . we eat organic food .
and when it suggests that these are the things that the future of good food , somebody on the side goes to say , &quot; hey , <unk> , i love the pink flamingos , but you &apos;re going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we produce calories anymore to feed the world .
one billion people will spend starvation today .
one billion -- more than ever before in history -- because of big inequities in the distribution , not <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it has determined the rationale of our food system over the last 50 years .
feed the <unk> , the plague of crop , the chicken to the fish , and all the way around , the <unk> has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding people more cheaply , how terrible can we be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motivation . it &apos;s been the <unk> . it &apos;s been the american business plan .
we should call it what it really is , a business in <unk> , a business that is rapidly <unk> the ecological capital that makes its own production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is being threatened today , not by a profit reduction , but by a reduction in resources .
not the last invention of syllables , but because of the fertile land , not by bombs , but by fresh water , not by <unk> , but by forests , and not by ships and fishing nets , but by fishes in the sea .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better . how can we create conditions that allow every community to feed itself ?
to do this , don &apos;t look at the model of the future <unk> .
it &apos;s really old and out .
it &apos;s <unk> in capital , chemistry , and machinery , and it &apos;s never really rich to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s the one that &apos;s based on two billion years of real work experience .
look at michelangelo , farmers like michelangelo .
<unk> that are not a world that are locked away in itself , would admit that instead of <unk> , <unk> that are growing in a prospective way , farmers who are not only producers , but expertise in relationships , but expertise .
because they are the ones who are also the flavor experts .
and i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re better chef than i will never be .
you know , i don &apos;t have a problem with that , because if that &apos;s the future of food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i can leave you this day with one big idea , it &apos;s that the data cluster we consume is more than the sum of the parts , and instead of looking at it as an information overload , what i want you to think of is how we can use that information to <unk> patterns and see that in another invisible way .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical death board organized by age .
this tool that i use is a small experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and with <unk> what i can do is i filter a particular cause of death , let &apos;s say accidents .
and immediately we see that a different pattern is made .
this is because , in the central section here , people are their most active stage , and here they are in the most fragile .
we can go back and look at the data because of death , seeing that disease and cancer are the usual suspects , even though it &apos;s not all for us .
if we take age , say under 40 years , we see that accidents are really the main cause that people must worry about .
and if you get more involved in that , it &apos;s more common in the case of men .
so you understand the idea that you see the information and the data in this way , it &apos;s like swimming on a living <unk> .
and if we can do this with raw data , why don &apos;t we do it for content as well ?
so what we have here , is the cover of all the <unk> that have been produced .
this whole thing here . on the web .
they can go back into their rooms and try this after my talk .
with <unk> , you can reduce it to a decade .
or reduce it to a particular year .
or you can leap straight into a particular editing .
so i &apos;m seeing this , i see athletes that have appeared in this issue , sports .
i &apos;m a fan of lance , so i &apos;ll give him a click of that , which reveals me , all the <unk> in which he &apos;s lance <unk> .
now if you just want to take a look at this , you could think , &quot; what if you look at everything related to cycling ? &quot;
so i can go back , and i can scale that .
and now i see greg <unk> .
so you have an idea that when you measure information like this , by spreading , by expanding , by <unk> , you &apos;re not looking at , you &apos;re not browsing .
they &apos;re doing something slightly different .
it &apos;s in the middle , and we think it changes the way information takes itself .
so i want to transport this idea a little bit , which is a bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve taken all the pages of wikipedia and we &apos;ve reduced them to a little summary .
the summary is a little <unk> and an icon that suggests the area of <unk> that comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the 500 more popular pages of wikipedia .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we can have a sense of the most popular <unk> in wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to select government .
now , having selected government , i can see that the wikipedia categories most often corresponded to that are the time <unk> magazine <unk> .
this is truly important because this reveals something that was not content on any page of wikipedia .
you can only take that look when you step back and see it all .
seeing one of these particular summaries , i can then drill into the concept of time <unk> magazine , and look at all .
so seeing these people , i can see that most of them come from government . some come from natural sciences . a few , come from the world of businesses . there &apos;s my boss , and one of them comes from music .
and most interest , bono is also a winner of the ted prize .
so we can jump up and take a look at all the winners of the ted prize .
as you can see , we &apos;re browsing the web for the first time , as if it were actually a network , not from page , but on a higher level of abstraction .
i want to show you one more thing i can maybe <unk> a little bit .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times <unk> here .
and <unk> , this tool -- i don &apos;t want a web browser ; it &apos;s really not a web browser , but you can see pages with it -- and we bring the technology zoom into every page like this .
i can go back , i can give a <unk> back to a specific section .
now , the reason it &apos;s important is because , by the simple fact of seeing pages of this way , i can see my full shipping history in the same way .
and i can go into what i &apos;ve done in particular time periods .
here , in fact , the state of all the demonstration i just gave .
and i can make a reproduction of some of the things i saw tonight .
and if i want to go back and see everything , i can take over and i can cut my records maybe by the search history . here , i was doing a little bit of <unk> search , and i was looking for <unk> , which is here at live <unk> .
and from here i can go to the website and make it available .
it &apos;s a metaphor that has a new purpose every time , and in every case it makes the sum bigger than the sum of its parts with the data .
so now , in this world , we think of data as a curse .
we talked about the information overload curse .
we talk about <unk> in data .
what if we turn it back to this and we put our head on the web , so that instead of going from one thing to the next , we would give ourselves the habit of being able to go from so many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that would otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being stuck in data , we can actually draw information .
and if , instead of just dealing with information , we can gather knowledge .
and if we have knowledge , then maybe we can find wisdom .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up with a science @-@ based diet .
at school , they were running a bus for an hour &apos;s school every day .
and i was always involved in a book , an ad @-@ fiction book , which i witnessed to my mind to other worlds , and i was , in an instance , the insatiable sense that i had .
and you know , curiosity also manifests itself in the sense that i was always in school , i was in the forest , making <unk> and taking samples , snakes , snakes and snakes , and <unk> , watching them through the microscope .
you know , i was a real fan of science .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , to understand the boundaries of the possibility .
and my love for science fiction was reflected in the world around me , all around what was happening , at the end of the &apos; 60s , <unk> the moon , <unk> the deep oceans .
jacques cousteau came out in our room with his incredible special rooms where he taught us animals and places and a wonderful world that we could never have imagined before .
so that sounded like her part of science fiction .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i found that , as i had no video games , or this version of films made by computer and all this media landscape , i had to create images in my head .
we all do , as kids who have to read a book , through the description of the author , we put something on the film screens of our heads .
so , my answer to this was painting , drawing aliens and their worlds , spaceship , all that .
i was infinitely experimenting with the mathematics class behind the notebook .
that was the creativity that i had to come out somehow .
and something interesting happened , the show of jacques <unk> actually <unk> me about that there was a world that was only sitting here on earth .
i could probably not go to an alien world on a spaceship one day . that seemed quite unlikely .
but that was a world that i could actually go , right here on earth , which was so alive and as exotic as anything i could have ever read one of those books .
so , i decided that i was going to turn myself into 15 years .
even though the only problem about that was that i lived in a canadian <unk> , at 600 miles from the near ocean .
even though i didn &apos;t let that leave me alone .
i gave her the can to my father until he finally discovered a class of diving , new york , right across the border we lived .
so , i <unk> myself in a pool in a <unk> in the middle of the wintertime in buffalo , new york .
and i didn &apos;t see a ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the last 40 years , i &apos;ve been about 3,000 hours underwater , 500 of them in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that that that habitat of the deep ocean and even the least profound , are so rich in an incredible life that actually exceeds the imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so boundless compared to our weak human imagination .
even today , i &apos;m still completely unaware of what i &apos;ve seen when i do these <unk> .
and my romance with the ocean continues , and just as loud as it was always .
even though i chose a profession , as an adult , it was the conductor .
and it seemed to be the best way to reconcile those stories , with the willingness to create images .
and i was , as a child , constantly drawing comics and things like that .
so , making movies was a way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course , the stories i documented were stories of science fiction : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; and &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and with &quot; the <unk> , &quot; i put my love for being underwater and diving , with making films .
by combining the two passions .
one interesting thing happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; which served to solve a determined storytelling problem in the movie , which was to create a type of liquid water creature , so we took the animation done by the computer , rendering it .
and it turned out to be the first characters on the surface made by a computer that has never been made in a movie .
and even though the film wasn &apos;t very profitable , practically no profits , i should say i witnessed something incredible , which was the audience , the world audience , was devastated by this apparent magic .
it &apos;s like arthur <unk> &apos;s law that says any advanced technology can &apos;t be distinguish from magic .
they saw something magical .
so that made me pretty much .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be adapted in the <unk> art . &quot;
so , &quot; 2nd terminator , &quot; my next movie , we took this much more <unk> .
working with <unk> , we created the liquid metal uncle in that movie , the <unk> was in whether the effect would work .
and it worked . and we created magic again , and we had the same outcome of the audience , even though we took something out of money with this .
so , drawing a line through those two points of experience , we came to see that , this was going to be a new world , this was a whole new world of creativity .
so , you think of a company with stan winston , my good friend stan , who is the main <unk> and designer at <unk> of the day , and we call it digital <unk> .
and the goal of the company was that you would have a leap on top of the optical <unk> processes , etc . , and you would direct directly to digital production .
and in fact , we did it and we got a competitive advantage for a while .
even though we were left behind in the mid @-@ 1990s in creating and designing characters , for what the company had been founded .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; , &quot; which was laid out absolutely to drive the development of visual effects , made by computer , but beyond that , with human characters created by a computer , and the main characters would be all mediated by the computer . and the world would be done by computer .
but the challenge was , and the company told me we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so i rented it , and i made this movie about a big boat that <unk> .
you know , i went and sold it to the studio like &quot; romeo and juliet : it &apos;s going to be a <unk> romance , an incredibly exciting film .
in tears , what i wanted to do was to immerse myself in the true <unk> of the titanic .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the study did not know .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go into the <unk> sands . let &apos;s record it real . &quot;
we &apos;ll use it at the beginning of the movie .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing force . &quot;
and i talked to them to fund an expedition .
it sounds crazy . but it goes backwards to what its imagination is to create a reality .
because in fact , we created a reality where six months later , i found myself in a russian submersible two miles and a half miles underwater , looking at the actual titanic through a window .
not in a movie , not in <unk> , really .
now , that made me fly to my mind .
and that took a lot of training , we had to build cameras and lights and all that kind of thing .
although , that made me realize how much of this dive , these profound <unk> seemed to be a spatial mission .
you know , it was pretty technical , and it had a huge planning .
you get into the capsule , you go down below that dark and you get an environment where there &apos;s no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t go back to you .
and i thought of something like , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like i was living a science fiction movie .
this is great . &quot;
so , i was really fascinated by the exploration of the deep ocean .
of course , curiosity , the scientific component of it . it was all . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood could not give me .
because , i could imagine a creature and we could create a special effect for her , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing through that window .
as we did in some of our <unk> expeditions , i was seeing <unk> across the <unk> of the water and sometimes things that i &apos;d never seen sometimes <unk> things that nobody had ever seen before , that actually wasn &apos;t described by science at the same time that we saw it and <unk> it .
so , i was completely disillusioned by this , and i had to do more .
so , i made a curious decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to set up my work as a director of hollywood , and i &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time <unk> . &quot;
so , we started planning these expeditions .
and we ended up going to the <unk> , and we <unk> with <unk> vehicles .
we went back to the remains of the titanic .
we took a few little robots that we had created with an optical fiber .
and the idea was to go in and make an inner recognition of the ship , which had not been done before .
no one had ever seen the remains of <unk> inside ; they &apos;d never had the media to do it , so we created a technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am , on the deck of the titanic , sitting in a submersible and looking at the planks that looked much like these , where i knew the gang had played .
and i would drive a little robotic vehicle across the aisle of the ship .
when i say , i drive , but my mind is in the vehicle .
as though it was physically present inside the titanic remains .
and it was the most surreal <unk> i &apos;ve ever had , because before we saw a corner , i knew what was going to be before the lights on the vehicle were dominated , because i had been dragging around the logs for months when we were making the film .
and the <unk> was based on an accurate replica of the airplane of the ship .
so it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
and it really made me realize the experience of television that you can have with these robots , through which your consciousness is embedded in a vehicle , in some form of existence .
it was really deep .
and it can be almost as a glimpse of what can be happening in a few decades when we start having bodies <unk> to explore , or somewhere in many of the future <unk> that i can imagine , like a fan of science fiction .
so , having done these expeditions , i really started to appreciate what was underneath , in the deep ocean <unk> where we had <unk> animals that are basically aliens here on earth .
they live in a <unk> habitat .
they don &apos;t survive a sun @-@ based system like us .
so , you &apos;re seeing animals that live about 500 degrees centigrade .
they may not even exist .
at the same time , i started to be very interested in spatial science as well , again , the influence of science fiction , as a child .
and i ended up with the space community , which is very involved with nasa , with a post in nasa &apos;s advice , planning real space missions , going to russia , checking the <unk> protocols for pre @-@ <unk> , and all that kind of thing , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d system .
and it was fascinating .
even though what i ended up doing was bringing scientists to space with us to the deep .
and they had access to them , they did biologists , planetary scientists , interested in these extreme habitats , <unk> the ventilation , <unk> to see , and take samples and test instruments , and all that .
so , there we were in documentaries , but actually we were doing science , and especially spatial science .
i had completely closed the bow between being a fan of science fiction , you know , as a child , and doing all of this .
and you know , over the course of this journey of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . although i learned a lot about leadership .
you may think that a conductor has to be a leader , a captain of the ship , and all that .
i hadn &apos;t really learned about leadership until i did those expeditions .
because i had to , at a certain point , i say , &quot; what am i doing here ?
why am i doing it ? what am i wearing from it ? &quot;
we won &apos;t make money with these <unk> programs .
there &apos;s hardly any <unk> in it .
people think that i &apos;d lie somewhere between &quot; titanic &quot; and avatar &quot; and i was <unk> the nails , somewhere , sitting on the beach .
i did all those movies , all those documentaries for a very reduced audience .
no fame , no fame , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it because of the task itself , by the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment , which is , by the excitement of discovery , and by that weird <unk> that when a small group of people form a very tight team .
because we would do these things with 10 @-@ 12 people working for years at a time , sometimes in the sea for two months at a time .
and with that <unk> , you realize that the most important thing is the respect you have and you have , when you do something you can &apos;t explain to each other .
when you go back to shore and you say , &quot; we have to do this , &quot; and the fiber , and the optical <unk> , and this and the other , all the technology of that , and the difficulty , the aspects of the human performance when you &apos;re working on the sea , you can &apos;t explain it to people . that &apos;s what they have done , or they have .
you create a <unk> , a <unk> of respect .
so , when i went back to make my next movie , which was in avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same principle of leadership in which i sent your team , and so you would win your respect .
and that really changed the dynamic .
and there i was with a little team in unexplored terrain in avatar , &quot; building new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremendously exciting .
terribly challenging .
and we became a family , during a four @-@ year period .
and that completely changed the way i make films .
people have <unk> on how they have changed , you know , we brought back to the organisms in the ocean and put them on pandora &apos;s planet .
for me , it was more a fundamental way to do the work , the process itself , which changed as a result of that .
so what can we summarize about all this ?
what are the lessons ?
well , i think the first one is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing they have .
imagination is a force that can manifest a reality .
and the respect of his team is more important than all the world &apos;s <unk> .
young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some advice to do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put you on limits .
other people will do it for you , don &apos;t do it for you , don &apos;t harm you and take risks . &quot;
nasa has a phrase they love : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has gone from being an option in art and exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
and no major effort that has required innovation has been done without running any risk .
they have to be willing to run risks .
and that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d leave you with , whatever you do , fail is a choice , but fear doesn &apos;t . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a little bit surprising because my full @-@ time work in the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , about things that we need to invent and to improve the lives of 2000 million poorest .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than any other on the planet .
climate change means that for many years their crops will not grow , there will be too much rain , or not enough rain , things will change so that their fragile environment can simply not sustain .
and that leads to hunger . it leads to <unk> .
climate change will be terrible for them .
also the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could choose one single thing that you would perceive the price to reduce poverty , without doubt the energy .
the price of energy has fallen through time .
indeed , the advanced civilization is based on energy advances .
the coal @-@ powered industrial revolution , and even in the years 1900 , we saw a rapid decrease in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have <unk> , air , we can make lots of modern materials and do so many things .
and then , we &apos;re in a fantastic situation with electricity in the developed world .
but as we make it more economical -- and let &apos;s try to make it twice more economic -- we must deliver a new constraint , and that restriction has to do with co2 .
co2 is heating the planet , and the equation of co2 is actually very simple .
if you add the co2 that &apos;s being emitted , that gives rise to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase occurs instead to some very negative effects , the effects about climate and maybe even worse , the <unk> effects , because the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adjust to these rapid changes , and then the ecosystems collapse .
the exact <unk> of how to map from a certain co2 increase to temperature we will have and the exact behavior of variables , there &apos;s some uncertainty there , but not too much .
and there are surely uncertainty about what those effects will be , but they &apos;ll be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the most scientists about this a number of times , do we have to go down to almost zero emissions ?
can we just cut a half or a quarter ?
and the answer is , until we can &apos;t close to zero , temperature will continue to increase .
and so that &apos;s a great challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we &apos;re a four @-@ foot tall truck trying to get under a 10 @-@ foot @-@ a @-@ half @-@ foot bridge , and we can somehow just utter a little bit to pass a little bit through it .
this is something that has to come to zero .
we make a lot of carbon dioxide every year , more than <unk> million tons .
about 20 metric tons per ton per square ton per one in the poor countries .
it gives you an average of about five metric tons per person on the planet .
and in a way , we must make changes to take that figure at zero .
it &apos;s been constantly completed .
it &apos;s only because of some economic change that has come to grips with , so we have to go from fast to <unk> , and we &apos;re going all the way down to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . so you have one thing on the left , co2 you want you to get to zero , and it will be based on how many people , the services each person uses on average , the energy on the average for every service , and the co2 per unit of energy .
so let &apos;s look at each and see how we can go down to zero .
probably some of these numbers will have to get close to zero .
now to go back to high school algebra , but let &apos;s get a bonus .
first , we have the population .
the world has currently <unk> million people .
and it &apos;s on the way to reach <unk> million .
now , if we do a big job in new vaccines , health care , and reproductive health services , we might be able to reduce that figure , maybe 10 or 15 percent , but there &apos;s a <unk> increase in the order of 1.3 to 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes everything , the food we eat , the sidewalk , the heat .
these are very good things , and eliminating poverty means giving these services to almost all over the world on the planet .
and it &apos;s a big thing that this number goes up .
in the rich world , maybe one billion <unk> , we could reduce and use less , but every year , this figure , on average , goes up and then , in general terms , goes more than double the services per person .
here &apos;s a very basic service . do you have light in your house so you can read the task ?
in fact , these kids are out there and they read their task under the light of street lamps .
now , efficiency @-@ e , is energy for every service , here , finally , we have good news .
we have something that &apos;s not increasing .
through various inventions and new ways of making lighting , through different types of cars , different ways of building <unk> , there are many services in which you can reduce energy consumption .
some individual services do it in 90 percent .
there are other services , such as the way to make the fertilizers , or the transportation of entomology , in which the <unk> are much smaller .
and then , in general here , if we &apos;re optimistic , we can maybe get to a factor of three , to maybe a factor of six .
but for these first three factors we went from <unk> million to maybe 8,000 million tons in the best cases , and that doesn &apos;t get the goal .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this one is going to be the key factor -- and this is the amount of co2 produced by every unit of energy .
and the question is , can you actually make it to zero ?
if we coal , no .
if you ate natural gas , no .
almost every method we create electricity today , except for the new renewables and nuclear , puts co2 .
and so what we &apos;re going to have to do on a global scale , is create a new system .
and then , we need miracles of energy .
when i use the word miracle , i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and services are a miracle .
the people who are here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
usually , we don &apos;t have a limitation , where you have to have the miracle ready for a certain date .
usually , in a certain way , and some people come , and another one .
this is a case where we really need to move forward at maximum speed and make a miracle in a very clenched time .
i thought , how can i really capture this concept ?
is there any type of natural illustration ? have you any show that people &apos;s imagination will be ?
i thought , in the past year when i brought in mosquitos , and in a sense , people will perceive it .
i actually got into the idea that , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
so , with the energy , the only thing that i came up with was this .
i decided that shutting down fireflies would be my contribution towards the environment here , this year .
so here are some natural fireflies .
i &apos;ve told me that i &apos;m not <unk> , in fact , maybe not out of this jar .
now , there are all sorts of <unk> solutions like that , but in the end , and they don &apos;t get too much .
we need solutions , it can be one or several , that have an unimaginable scale and an unimaginable variability , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for , i just see that five changes can achieve .
i left the near @-@ power , geothermal energy , fusion and bio @-@ fuels .
those can come into a contribution , and if you can get more than i hope , much better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t fit them into any of them because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels that are burning , both burning or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there looks simple , but it &apos;s not , and this is to take all the co2 after the combustion from its head to high pressure , create a liquid , stick it somewhere , and expect it to stay there .
we have a pilot trials that achieve this with a success between 60 and 80 percent , but reaching 100 percent , that will be very difficult , and agree on where to store these tons of co2 will be difficult , but the most difficult thing here is the long term .
is it going to be safe ?
are you going to guarantee something that &apos;s literally one billion times bigger than any other kind of <unk> compared to nuclear or other ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is complicated .
next , it would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems . the cost is high , particularly in highly <unk> countries , the subject of security , feel really good that nothing can fail , that even having human operators , the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the rubbish ?
and even though it &apos;s not very large , there are many concerns about it .
people need to feel <unk> about it .
so they &apos;re three very difficult problems that could be solved , and you should work on them .
we will last three of the five .
these are the ones that many times people refer to as renewable sources .
and actually -- although it &apos;s very good that they don &apos;t require any fuel -- they have some disadvantages .
one is that energy density in these technologies is dramatically less than an energy plant .
these are energy farms , so we &apos;re talking about lots of square miles , thousands of times bigger than traditional energy plants .
in addition , these are <unk> sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day , doesn &apos;t shine every day , and in the same way , the <unk> doesn &apos;t penetrate all the time .
and then , if we depend on these sources , we have to have some way to get the energy during those periods where it &apos;s not available .
so here we have big cost challenges . we have delivery challenges . for example , if this energy is out of our country , we don &apos;t just need the technology , but we have to deal with the risk of energy from the other side .
and finally , this storage problem .
and , in order to expand , i study and look at all the kinds of batteries that are made , for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything , and i compared that to the amount of energy that the world uses , and what i discovered is that all the batteries that we make might now store less than 10 minutes of that energy .
so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough in this regard , an improvement by a factor of a hundred or more than the advances we have today .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very easy .
this is what happens when you try to get the <unk> source to be up for 20 or 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re telling this for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
how are we going to move forward with this ? what &apos;s the right way of <unk> ?
is it like the manhattan project ? what is it that &apos;s going to take us to its destination ?
well , we need a lot of companies working on this , <unk> .
in each of these five ways , we need at least a hundred people .
and many of them , <unk> and say they &apos;re nuts . that &apos;s good .
and i think here in the ted group , we have a lot of people who are already pursuing this goal .
bill <unk> has various companies , including one called <unk> that has several very good solar technologies .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is investing in dozens of companies that are doing big things , and they have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to distance them .
with nathan myhrvold -- we &apos;re criticizing a <unk> , which is , perhaps , amazingly , on the nuclear .
there are innovation in nuclear : modular , liquid .
and the innovation goes into this industry quite a while ago , so the concept that there are some good ideas running around is not surprising .
the idea behind <unk> is that instead of burning part of the uranium , one percent , we decided , we will double the 99 percent , the <unk> .
it &apos;s a crazy idea .
in fact , people have talked about this for a long time , but they could never properly simulate whether it would work or not , and it &apos;s through the arrival of the modern supercomputers that you can simulate and see that , yes , with the right material , it seems that it could work .
and because you &apos;re burning 99 percent , you have a profile of highly improved costs .
you &apos;re actually burning the waste , and you can use it as fuel all the waste you &apos;re coming from today &apos;s reactors .
so instead of worrying about them , you use them . it &apos;s a big thing .
it &apos;s consuming this uranium as we go through it . it &apos;s like a candle .
as you can see there , it &apos;s a stem , it will often be like a spread generator .
on the fuel level , this actually solves the problem .
i have a picture here from a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent , of which already took the part that &apos;s burning today , so it &apos;s called uranium <unk> .
that made sure of electricity in the united states for hundreds of years .
and , simply by putting seawater through a low @-@ cost process , you would have enough fuel for the entire rest of the planet .
so , you know , it has many challenges ahead , but it &apos;s an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to go ahead .
so , let &apos;s think , how should we define ourselves ?
what should our school address look like ?
well , let &apos;s look where we actually have to get there , and then let &apos;s look at the middle point .
by 2050 , you listened to a lot of people talking about this 80 percent reduction .
it &apos;s really important that we get to that point .
and that 20 percent will be used by needs in poor countries like agriculture , we will hopefully destroy <unk> and cement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to change its entire generation .
so the other note is , are we <unk> this zero @-@ emission technology ? are we <unk> it in all developed countries ? and are we in the process of bringing it back to other places ?
that &apos;s very important .
it &apos;s a key element to pass that school letter .
so , going back from there , how should you see the cartoon of the year 2020 ?
well , again , i should have two elements .
we should establish these efficiency measurements to begin to make a difference . the less the co2 , the less co2 , and therefore the less it will be the temperature .
but in some ways , the note that we get there , doing things that don &apos;t take us all the way to the big <unk> , is just the same , or maybe even a little less important than the other , which is the piece of innovation of these big breakthroughs .
these advances , we need to move at maximum speed , and we can measure that at the level of companies , pilot projects , and require that they have changed .
there are many good books that have been written about this .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; our <unk> &quot; and the book of david <unk> , &quot; sustainable <unk> , without hot air . &quot;
they actually study it and they create a framework for this to be widely discuss , because we need broad support for this .
there &apos;s a lot to <unk> .
so this is a desire .
it &apos;s a very concrete desire that will counteract this technology .
if i had only one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose who is president , i could choose a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could choose this thing that has half the cost and zero co2 emissions is invented this desire that i predicted .
this is the one that has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t have this desire , the split between people who think in the short term and in the long term will be terrible , between the united states and china , between the poor and rich countries , and most of the lives of those two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what am i focusing on you for you to step forward and drive ?
we need to look more funding for research .
when countries get together in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just discuss co2 .
you should discuss on this innovation agenda , and you would be shocked by these levels of ridiculously low overhead by these innovative approaches .
we need the market incentives , co2 tax incentives , carbon bonds , something that will counteract that price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need this <unk> to be more rational , than a <unk> , including the steps facing the government .
this is an important desire , but it &apos;s a desire that i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand more about <unk> , right -- i mean , first of all : can you give us a sense that scale of what would be the scale of investment ?
bill gates : to make the software out of super @-@ computer , to employ all of the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and we even test our materials on a russian reactor to make sure our materials work correctly , there alone would be in the hundreds of millions .
the hard thing is to build the pilot , get the various billions , find the regulator , the location in which one would be building the first of these .
once you have the first built , and if it works like intended , then , it &apos;s clear as day , because economic variables and energy density are so different from nuclear as we know it .
to understand well , it involves building deep on the ground almost like a bottom @-@ up nuclear fuel column , of this type of uranium already used , and then the process starts from above and then goes down ?
tt : it &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always producing gas from the reactor , so you have a lot of people and a lot of controls that can have a bug that you have to open and move things in and out . that &apos;s not good .
so if you have a very cheap fuel from which you can already carry for about 60 years -- just think of yourself as a stem -- <unk> and not have those same complications .
and it &apos;s only sitting there and burned for the 1960s , and then it &apos;s there .
it &apos;s a nuclear plant that includes its own solution of waste disposal .
tt : yeah . well , what happens to the waste , you can leave it there -- there &apos;s much less waste with this approach -- then you can actually grab that one , and put it into another and burn it .
and we started taking the waste that exists today , which is in these cooling <unk> or <unk> <unk> , which is our fuel to break .
so what was a problem for those reactors is what we feed our own , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of waste in a way that &apos;s pretty much due to going back into the process .
but when you talk to different people around the world , about these possibilities .
where is there more interest to actually do something with this ?
dw : well , we haven &apos;t chosen a place in particular , and there are all these rules of spread about anything called nuclear , so we &apos;re very interested in the business people have been in russia , india and china . i was here with the secretary , talking about how this would fit into the energy agenda .
so i &apos;m optimistic . french and japanese have done some work .
this is a variation on something that has previously been made .
it &apos;s an important breakthrough , but it &apos;s like a quick reactor , and many countries have built it , so anybody who has done a quick reactor is a candidate to be where the first one is .
so , in your head , scale of time and probability of putting something online ?
dw : well , we need first one of these things on top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ scale that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to implement .
that &apos;s more or less the time we should be in the environment .
and , you know , let &apos;s face it , if things are working well , which is desire so much , it could easily be .
and there are now , fortunately , dozens of companies , but we need them to be hundreds , that at once , if their science works well , if the funding for their plants works well , that they can compete for it .
and it &apos;s better if several of them are successful , because you could use a blend .
we need one to be successful .
in terms of large @-@ scale changes , this is the biggest thing you know that exists ?
<unk> : a revolutionary progress in energy is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without environmental diet , but environmental diet does so much more important .
in the world of nuclear , there are other innovators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their jobs as well as we know this , but modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a fluid reactor that looks a little bit difficult , but maybe you &apos;ll say the same thing about us .
and then , there are many different , but the beauty in this is that the uranium atom has millions of times more energy than , for example , a carbon atom and then , if you can deal with the negative dots , which are essentially the radiation , the footprint and the cost , in terms of effect on the land and various things , it &apos;s almost entirely in a category .
what if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we begin to take action measure that we should try to keep the temperature stable ?
dw : if you go into that situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten from more , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack . what do you do ? you possibly need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on something called geo @-@ engineering , which are various techniques that will reduce warming to give us a maybe 20 or 30 years from now , until we agree .
now , that &apos;s just a insurance <unk> .
you don &apos;t expect to do that .
some people say that you shouldn &apos;t work on the insurance <unk> because you can make yourself safe and <unk> by eating because you know that your heart surgery will save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the option given to the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the discussion about geo @-@ engineering , if we should have it on our sleeve , in case things were going faster , or that innovation is much slower than what we expected .
climate <unk> : if you had a sentence or two to tell you , like the <unk> that are wrong ?
tt : well unfortunately , the skeptics come from different sides .
scientists who make scientific arguments are very few .
are you saying that there are negative feedback effects that you have to do with clouds that offset things ?
there &apos;s very , very few things you can even say there &apos;s a possibility in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here is something like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay the price much later .
and then , when you have all sorts of other urgent problems , the idea of suffering now that has to do with a profit later -- and an uncertain suffering -- in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst stage , and there are people in the developed world who look at the ipcc and say , well , this is not that big deal .
the fact is that it &apos;s that uncertain part that i should go into this .
but my dream here is that if you can do it in an economic way , and with the co2 constraints , then i &apos;m going to say , well , i don &apos;t care that i &apos;m not going to co2 , i would like you to co2 , but i think i accept it because it &apos;s cheaper .
and then , that would be your response to the <unk> argument , which basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take your attention away from your other objectives of trying to release the world of poverty , and malaria , and etc . that investment in that is a waste of the resources that we can do .
dw : well , real spending on the part of i &apos;m r &amp; amp ; d -- says the united states should spend 10,000 million more than what they &apos;re currently doing -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
i shouldn &apos;t take it to other things .
the moment you go into big numbers , and in this reasonable people can disagree , it &apos;s when you have something that &apos;s not economical and you &apos;re trying to kill them . that &apos;s , largely , a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re funding the learning curve , and you &apos;re going to get really cheap . i think we should try more things that have a potential to be much less costly .
if the exchange you enter is , let &apos;s make the super @-@ expensive energy , then rich can buy it .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times more for our energy and not change our lifestyles .
the disaster is for those two billion .
and even <unk> has even changed .
his <unk> now is , because isn &apos;t he discussing the r &amp; amp ; d ?
it &apos;s still , because of its earlier arguments , associated with the kind of <unk> , but it &apos;s realized that it &apos;s on a pretty solitary side , and then it &apos;s <unk> the argument of the i &apos;m r &amp; amp ; d.
and then there &apos;s a string of something that i think is appropriate .
the part of i &amp; amp ; d , it &apos;s incredible how little it &apos;s being funded .
well bill , i suspect i speak at the name of most people here saying , i really hope your desire becomes reality . thank you very much .
tt : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> introduced the <unk> of design called the <unk> .
and the idea is pretty simple . four people have to build an autonomous structure with 20 <unk> , a string <unk> , a string <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow must go up above all .
and even though it looks easy , it &apos;s a rather difficult thing , because it force people to collaborate very fast .
and so i thought it was an interesting idea , and i hung it into a design shop .
and it was a great success .
and since then , i &apos;ve taken about 70 design workshops around the world with students , designers and architects , all the <unk> of major companies , and there &apos;s one particular exercise that reveals deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
most people start <unk> with the task .
the members and they discuss and calculate how the structure will be , will by the power .
then you have time planning , put on . you draw spaghetti .
they spend most of their time riding the <unk> .
and then finally , right when you just take the marshmallow , and with precaution , you put it on top , and then you look away , and &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
but in fact , what &apos;s often happening is that the &quot; da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ <unk> &quot; makes the weight of the caribbean makes the entire structure collapse .
so there are a number of people who have more &quot; oh no &quot; than others , and among the worst , are the graduates at business school .
lie , they cheat , they <unk> , and they produce <unk> structures .
and , of course , there are teams that have so many more structures , &quot; da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ da structures .
and this is pretty incredible .
peter tells us , they &apos;re not only getting the tallest structures , but they &apos;re also the most interesting structures of all .
so , what you would say is , how ? why ? what is it that they have ?
peter likes to say , &quot; none of the kids attempt to be the ceo of spaghetti sauces . right .
they don &apos;t spend any time fighting .
but there &apos;s also another reason .
and that is that business students are trained to find the only right , right .
and then they don &apos;t do it .
and what happens is , when you put the marshmallow on them , they have no time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
can you feel something ? ok .
what kids do differently , is they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , they always keep the marshmallow on top , so they have a lot of opportunities for failed prototypes in the process .
designers consider this kind of collaboration as the essence of the <unk> process .
and with every version , kids get a snapshot observations about what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the ability to play with prototypes is essential , but let &apos;s look at different teams .
the average for most people is about half feet , business students , they get half of that , lawyers , a little bit better , but not much , kids , better than most adults .
who gets better than anybody ?
architects and engineers , thank god !
the highest structure i &apos;ve seen is one meter .
why would it be ? because they understand that the triangles and the patterns self @-@ sustain are the key to building stable structures .
the ceos , a little better than the average , but this is where they get interesting .
if you put a management executive in the team , ceos get better .
it &apos;s amazing . let &apos;s take a look and say , &quot; oh , that team is going to win . &quot;
you can see you in advance . and why ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they take the process , they understand it .
and any team that manages and <unk> in the work will significantly enhance the performance of his team .
specialized skills and <unk> , and the combination leads you to success .
if you have 10 teams who are often working together , we will work with about six stable structures .
and i took something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s make the bet .
i decided to offer 10,000 dollars in software to the winning team .
and what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . none of the teams had a stable structure .
if somebody had built , let &apos;s say , a one @-@ inch structure , they could have taken the prize for a house .
isn &apos;t it interesting that high risk has a strong impact ?
we did the same test with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
under these conditions , they understood the value of the prototypes .
and the same team step from being the worst to be amongst the best .
they get the tallest structures in the short time .
there are important lessons here about the phenomenon of incentives and success .
you would say , &quot; why would someone spend time designing a <unk> challenge ? &quot;
and the reason is that i will help create digital tools and processes to help teams build video games , video games and visual effects .
and what the challenge of the marshmallow is to help you with the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , all projects have their marshmallow , right ?
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common posture of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of the experience , of this simple exercise .
and those of you , you might want to visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how you build a <unk> .
there are instructions on this .
there are insane examples coming from around the world of how people change and retain the system .
there are world records as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i think , is that design is a contact sport .
we have all our senses sitting on the task , and we apply to our best ideas , our feelings and acts on the <unk> that we occupy .
and sometimes , a small prototype of this experience is all we need to take us from a &quot; oh @-@ no @-@ &quot; moment &quot; by a &quot; da <unk> . &quot;
and that can create a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s realize we have a machine right here .
a big machine , a super @-@ style machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and that each one in this room has to get into it .
and you can go back , you can go forwards ; you can &apos;t stay where you are .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i was making my friends this rather recently , and all of them want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . you want to go back before i &apos;d cook or twitter , or &quot; american idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some kind of cruel to <unk> , to the magical thought .
and i get that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because the possibilities on this planet , they &apos;re not going back , they &apos;re going forward .
so i want to get into the machine and i want to go forwards .
this is the best time i &apos;ve ever spent on this planet under any criteria you want to use : health , mobility , opportunity , disease rates going down .
there has never been a time like this .
my <unk> died , all of them for when they arrived at 60 .
my grandparents attribute that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in 80 .
so it &apos;s better than a nine in the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us because this is much bigger than that .
a child born in delhi today can waiting to live as much as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about that . it &apos;s an amazing fact .
and why is this true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed millions of people on this planet .
they explored the demographics in a way that no war has done it .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s gone .
the <unk> . <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases that benefit millions of us only one generation back , almost .
blindness , <unk> , polio ...
somebody even knows that they &apos;re these things ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are victories by the scientific method .
and in my mind , the scientific method , testing things , see whether it works , change it when it doesn &apos;t work , is one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the only good news because there are other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is that , despite all our achievements , one billion people go to bed hungry in this world , every day .
that number is growing , and very fast , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to shatter this world .
clean water , <unk> soil , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re running out , and they &apos;re running out soon , and unless we invest in a solution to this disaster , we will regenerate ourselves .
so , the question is , we can do it ? i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that &apos;s going to thousands of people without <unk> the land we live on .
i think we can feed this world with energy that we can &apos;t feed it to time .
i really believe this , and no , it &apos;s not magical thinking .
but there &apos;s one thing that doesn &apos;t let me sleep -- one of the things that keeps me up . we &apos;ve never needed the progress of science more than now , never before .
and we &apos;ve never been in a position to think about it correctly , as we can today .
we &apos;re on the edge of astonishing events in many fields , and yet i certainly believe that we should go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we &apos;re going to spend progress , where we &apos;re going to spend more on these more <unk> , on more fronts , than what we do now .
people are wrapped in their beliefs , and they make it so easy that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will make them free .
and listen , everybody has the right to have their opinion ; they have the right to have their opinion about progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
you have no right to have your own facts . sorry , but you don &apos;t .
and notice this took me a while .
a decade ago , i wrote a vaccine for &quot; the new yorker , a short story .
and i &apos;m surprised to find opposition , as opposed to what it is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i did , i wrote an article and went ahead .
and soon after that , i wrote an article about genetically modified foods .
it did the same , only worse .
people were saving .
so i took an article about it as well , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; frankenstein , &quot; why we reasoned that to move the <unk> in a certain way , more than a neglected , it was invade the terrain of nature .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article and i went ahead .
i mean , i &apos;m just a journalist .
<unk> , let &apos;s go for dinner , it &apos;s okay .
but these stories , i was teased , and i could not understand why , and i finally became .
and that happened because the fanatics who were getting me crazy weren &apos;t really fans .
i was thinking people , decent , decent people .
they were exactly like people in this room .
and i was so worried about that .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress that we used to have .
we talked about him clapping .
we talk about it in relative terms , quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for it , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we have lost faith in the institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we haven &apos;t done it .
you can just say a few names and the people are saving .
<unk> , <unk> , the challenger , <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , <unk> electoral <unk> .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe that they were always right , so be skeptical .
ask , test , test evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for granted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get evidence , you have to accept evidence , and we &apos;re not good at doing that .
and the reason i can say this is because we &apos;re now in a scary epidemic i &apos;ve never seen before , and i hope i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a <unk> published , a terrible story , that prevented the autism epidemic to receive the vaccine against measles , <unk> and <unk> .
very frightening .
lots of studies were made to see if this was true .
lots of studies had to do , is a serious issue .
the results came .
the results came from the united states , england , from sweden , from canada , and everything was the same , no correlation , no connection , anything .
that doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe in what we see , in what we think we see , in what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a lot of documents from government giving us information , and i understand that , i think we all understand .
but you know what ?
the result of it has been disastrous .
disastrous by this fact : the united states is one of the few countries in the world in which vaccination rates are coming down .
this is unfortunate , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it &apos;s awful .
what kind of thing went on for us to do that .
now , i get it . i certainly get it .
because here , some of you have measles ?
have anybody in the audience ever seen anybody die from measles ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very much .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened sometimes in the past year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from measles . 20 an hour .
but because it hasn &apos;t happened here , we can take it out of our minds , and people like jenny can prescribe fear and carbonate from wherever oprah and larry <unk> .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t have causality and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these two things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same thing .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn very soon .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
the removed from us one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
without fear , without fear : polio , als , no more .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul <unk> .
he only developed a vaccine against <unk> with a group of people .
he saved the lives of 400,000 to 500,000 children per year in the world alone .
pretty good , no ?
well , it &apos;s okay , except because paul is out there talking about vaccines , and he says how valuable they are and that people should simply stop .
and actually , he says that .
so , paul is a terrorist .
when paul talks in a public audience , he can &apos;t be evicted without armed guards .
they get calls in their home because people like to tell him where their kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
and i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you get them , and diseases come back , awful diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and very soon kids are going to die of that again because it &apos;s just a game of numbers .
and they &apos;re not going to die only from measles .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a school partner told me about weeks ago , and he said i was a little stubborn .
never before had somebody said that .
she was not going to get her son to polio . anyway .
okay .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy took an airplane in lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to los angeles , right now he &apos;s on ohio .
and it &apos;s going to land within a couple of hours , it &apos;s going to rent a car , and it &apos;s going to come to long beach , and it &apos;s going to go and go into one of these fantastic dinner tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a disfiguring disease , and we don &apos;t know , because it works the world .
this is the planet we live in . let &apos;s not do it as we don &apos;t .
now , we love <unk> in lies . we love doing it .
everybody took their vitamins tonight ?
let &apos;s face it , a little <unk> to stay young .
i know they did it because half the americans do it every day .
they take those things , and they take medicines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they don &apos;t serve anything .
data tells you all the time .
you urine your urine . you almost never do more than that .
okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for the dark .
i &apos;m totally with you .
urine . dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand , we hate the big drug .
we hate the big governments . we don &apos;t trust the guy .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health system sucks .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolute and amazingly cold , and even for those we can pay for it .
so let &apos;s take care of him , and where we run ?
we jump into the arms of the great <unk> .
it &apos;s fantastic . i love the grand mufti .
but , you know , it &apos;s a really serious thing because these things are rubbish , and we spend billions of dollars on them .
and i have all kinds of little supplements here .
none of them -- <unk> , fraud , fraud , fraud , fraud , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what it is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on this , is a fraud .
and you know what ? when i say this , people scream at me , and they say , &quot; what do you mind ? let people do whatever you want .
he makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m not going to do any case of the evidence of my experts at <unk> or some sort of <unk> , who wants to treat his patient with coffee <unk> .
when you start the <unk> where you believe and magic replace evidence and science , in a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up <unk> , south africa .
he killed the <unk> of his people on top of himself by <unk> the lemon oil and bone oil were much more effective than anti @-@ retrovirals that we know can reduce the progress of aids .
hundreds of thousands of death toll in a country that has been fighting more than any of this disease .
please don &apos;t tell me that there &apos;s no consequences for these things .
there are . there are always .
now , the most insane epidemic in which we are , right now , is this insane battle between the ones who are proposing genetically modified and the organic elite .
it &apos;s a stylized debate . it has to end .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metaphor .
ideology , it &apos;s not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every <unk> of <unk> , every <unk> in brussels , has been modified by the man .
you know , i hadn &apos;t entered the garden of eden .
there was no <unk> .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some things worked and some things didn &apos;t .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more precisely . and there are hazards , absolutely . but we can put a little bit of vitamin a in rice , and that can help millions of people , millions of people , to prolong their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i should say , i don &apos;t understand .
we tended to genetically modified foods .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , hormones , crop , crop , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want <unk> companies .
we don &apos;t want seed companies .
and you know what my answer is to all that ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . they &apos;re clapping .
it &apos;s true , we have a very large food problem , but this is not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s the law , it &apos;s the moral , it &apos;s the patent issue .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea . it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t let science make its work because we &apos;re scared , it &apos;s really fatal , and it &apos;s avoiding millions of people can thrive .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to produce 70 percent more food than today , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
they need it , and we &apos;re not going to steal it .
and why ? genetically modified foods .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat those bad things , like <unk> .
<unk> is something that 500 million people eat .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a lot of calories . it sucks .
and it has no nutrients , it has no proteins , and scientists are bending all of this in it right now .
and then people could eat it and they could avoid being blind .
you wouldn &apos;t die of hunger , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be &quot; <unk> , &quot; but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is , why are we exhausted ?
i mean , hey , why are we exhausted ?
because we don &apos;t want to move from the genes ?
it &apos;s about moving genes from place . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> to have bigger , better food , unique food .
this is not about bulgarians , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s time that we start to understand what that means .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue acting as we are now , we are guilty of something i don &apos;t think we were guilty of being guilty , high @-@ tech <unk> .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beyond us , and we really have <unk> .
so , after this funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get into this ridiculous time machine and go forwards ? &quot;
absolutely . i want .
it &apos;s rooted in the present now , but we have an awesome opportunity .
we can program that time machine in what we want .
we can move where we want , and we &apos;re going to move where we want to move .
we must have these conversations , and we need to think , but when we get on the machine and go forward , we &apos;re going to be happy to do it .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the effect of <unk> , which may seem like a strange thing in what a magician might be interested in , not being in the way that i do it , which is , &quot; if somebody believes something fake enough , it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in some studies , the placebo effect , only because one person thinks that what &apos;s going on is something that &apos;s pharmaceutical or something like a treatment of pain , for example , if you believe enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect on the body called the placebo effect .
a false thing becomes real because of the perception you have .
so we better understand , i want to start by showing you a simple magic trick and rudimentary .
and i will demonstrate you how it works . this is a trick that has been in the books of children since at least the 1950s .
i learned it from the <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll tell you because i explained it .
this is what happens .
the knife , which you can examine , examine my hand .
he <unk> the knife in my fist like this .
my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing goes up or come down , i &apos;ll hold my wrist up here .
so at any point , i can move around , at the time my wrist , where nothing can go up and down my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and i hope , if this whole <unk> , my animal magnetism <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s sustained so strongly that i can hide , and the knife does not fall .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , nothing you can look at everything .
<unk> @-@ da !
so this is the trick that i usually teach young people who are interested in <unk> , because they can learn quite a bit about comforting in this trick -- even when it &apos;s a simple trick .
probably many of you in this room know the trick .
what happens is this .
i &apos;m holding the knife with my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to hold my wrist , to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , it &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding my wrist is because that &apos;s really the secret of illusion .
at the moment that the front of my hand moves to be hidden from you , this finger , my finger will move where it is , to a position pointing like this .
very good .
somebody who didn &apos;t have childhood is there .
so , it &apos;s moving over here .
and as i move , my finger moves .
and we could talk about why it &apos;s a deception , why they didn &apos;t realize there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind , and how the information processes , doesn &apos;t count one , two , three . the <unk> .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about , right ? so i open my hand .
obviously this hanging there and not by animal magnetism , if not fraud , my finger is there .
and when i close my finger , just like that , when i move around , this movement sort of covers my finger &apos;s <unk> .
he retirement his hand . he <unk> the knife .
this is a trick that you can do for your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now . what does this have to do with the placebo effect ?
i read a studio , about a year ago that really opened my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me was an amazing thing .
it turns out that if you use a dummy placebo in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s like the shape of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a long white pill , it has certain measurable effects .
but if you change the way you put the dummy placebo , like making a smaller pill , the blue <unk> , and you give it a letter , is notoriously effective .
even when none of the two have a pharmaceutical effect -- those are sugar pills .
but the white pill , it &apos;s not as good as the blue pill .
what ? that really resonated with me .
but it turns out that &apos;s not all .
if you have capsules , they &apos;re more effective than any other tablet .
a colored capsule , this is yellow on one side and red on the other , is <unk> that a white capsule .
<unk> has something to do with it .
a two @-@ fold pill a day , it &apos;s not as good as three <unk> -- i don &apos;t remember the statistics now . sorry .
but the point is ...
these <unk> have something to see .
and the shape also has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you go into the needles .
right ? a syringe has something <unk> a couple of <unk> of something that &apos;s an inert , and i &apos;ll look at the patient .
this is a very powerful picture in your mind , this is much stronger than any white pill .
it &apos;s actually , this graph , i &apos;ll show you at another time when there &apos;s the slides .
the point is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , and this isn &apos;t as good as the capsule and it &apos;s not as good as the needle .
and no one really has any pharmaceutical quality . it &apos;s just your belief that makes it real in your body and creates a strong effect .
i &apos;d like to see if you could actually take that idea , and apply it to a magic trick .
take something that &apos;s actually a fake trick and make it look real .
and we know from that study , that when you want something real , you get rid of the needles .
this is a seven @-@ inch hat hat hat , and i &apos;m going to play it a little bit .
this is my tissue . this is not . the special tissue of <unk> .
this is my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to penetrate my skin , and through the needle up to the other side .
if you were injured -- if you were easily criticized -- i was doing this for some friends at the hotel on the other night , and other people i didn &apos;t know , and a woman nearly drowned .
so i would suggest to you that if you &apos;re easily injured , look on the other side by the next -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;m going to do this first part of the next <unk> .
you &apos;ll see , you can look at the other side if you want .
so , this is what happens , the beginning of my tissue at the bottom of my arm , i made a little <unk> .
sorry , am i annoyed ?
and i warmed my skin a little bit , and i take it on the other side like this .
now , essentially we are in the same position as the knife trick .
somehow .
but right now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , or you can ?
so let me push you . one , two , three , four , five .
yeah , ok .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; well , he &apos;s not as silly to cut the skin just like <unk> for a few minutes . &quot;
so let me show you a little bit .
how are you going ? all right .
yeah .
and people back up there will say , &quot; okay , i can &apos;t see it . &quot;
the people in the living room are starting to move .
let me show you a little bit more .
this is really my skin . it &apos;s not a hollywood <unk> effect .
this is my flesh and i can move around .
sorry , if you &apos;re peering into something else , don &apos;t look at this .
people in the back or people who see the video will say , &quot; well , you see the effect , &quot; but if it were real , he would do this -- notice that there &apos;s a gap here and another there , if it were real , he would be absolutely upset .
well , let me show you a little bit of blood .
yeah , there it is .
usually , now i &apos;d be taking the needle .
i took my arm and showed them that there are no wounds .
but i think in this context , and with the idea of taking something false , and making it real , i &apos;ll leave it like this , and i &apos;ll get out of the stage .
i &apos;ll be watching you several times during the <unk> days .
i hope you will . thank you very much .
everybody speaks about happiness in these days .
i made somebody tell the number of books with the word &quot; happiness , &quot; in the title , published in the last five years and gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there &apos;s a huge outbreak of interest about happiness , among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of advice about happiness .
everybody in the world would like to make people happier .
but despite all this crowd of jobs , there are various shades of cognitive that make almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today will be especially about these matching cognitive traps .
this is both about the ordinary people who think about their own <unk> as the academics who are talking about happiness , because it turns out that we are as confused as others .
the first of these booby is <unk> in <unk> its complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is no longer a useful word because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s one particular meaning that we could neglect , but in general , this is something that we will have to <unk> , and we will have to adopt the toughest view of what the welfare is .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory : especially being happy in life and be happy with your life or your life as happy .
and these are two very different concepts , and both are <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the illusion of focus , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think of any <unk> that affects welfare without <unk> its importance .
i mean , this is a fundamental cognitive trap .
it &apos;s impossible not to fail .
now i &apos;d like to begin with an example of someone in a question and answers , after one of my conferences , who told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said i &apos;d been hearing a symphony and it was an absolutely wonderful music and at the end of the recording , there was a terrible sound .
and then he said , really quite affected , that he &apos;d lost his full experience .
but it wasn &apos;t .
what had gone missing was the memories of that experience .
i had had the experience .
i &apos;d had 20 minutes of a glorious music .
and they did not know at all because they stayed with a memory , the memory had gone wrong , and it was all they left .
what this tells us , actually , is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two <unk> .
there &apos;s a self that has experiences , which lives in the present and knows the present , is able to revive the past , but basically it has the present .
it &apos;s the self that has experiences that treat a physician when you ask , &quot; do you hurt now , when i play here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a self that remembers , and the self that reminds is that it takes note , and it holds the history of our life , and it &apos;s the doctor asking him , &quot; how do you feel lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; how did your trip to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different entities , the self that has experiences and the self that has memories and <unk> between them is part of how problematic happiness .
now , the self that has memories is a storyteller .
and that &apos;s really starting as an immediate response to our memories -- <unk> .
we don &apos;t just tell stories , when we tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get left to remember from our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
this is an old studio .
these are actual patients being treated by a painful procedure .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer painful these days , but it was , when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to lie on their pain every 60 seconds .
and here we have two patients . these are the data .
and if you ask , &quot; who suffered from them ? &quot;
it &apos;s a very easy question .
of course , the patient b suffered more . their <unk> went longer , and every minute of pain the patient a had the patient a b b and even more .
but now we ask another question : &quot; how many of these patients have suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s the surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a had a much worse memory of the <unk> than the patient b.
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is as a result .
and none of these stories inspire a lot , but one of them is different ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse was the one in which the pain had its peak at the end . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after the training , and much later , &quot; how painful was the experience , in general ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in the way you remember it .
so it &apos;s a direct conflict between me having experiences and the self that reminds .
from the point of view of the self that has experiences , it &apos;s clear that b had a worse experience .
now , what we could do with the patient a , and in fact we did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it really works , could spread the <unk> of the patient by just keeping the tube out without moving too much .
that will make the patient suffer , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you do it for a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve made that the self that has experiences from the patient a a will pose a worse situation , and that i remember the patient a &apos;s is much better , because now you have provided the patient a &apos;s better story about their experience .
what defines a story ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory provides us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
what defines a story are changes , the important moments and the end .
the end is very , very important , and in this case , we will last the end .
now , the self that has its life live in its continuous form .
it has experiences , one after another .
and i &apos;ll tell you , what about these experiences ?
and the answer is very simple . they get lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments in our life -- and i calculated it -- <unk> , the psychological present is said to have about three seconds of length , which means that in a life there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there are close to 600,000 . most of them won &apos;t leave .
most of them are completely ignored by me .
and yet , in a way , it seems to be noted , that what happens to us in these moments and experiences is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource we have while we &apos;re in this world .
and how to use it , it seems to be relevant , but that &apos;s not the story that we have for ourselves the self to remember .
so we have the self that reminds and the self that has experiences , and they &apos;re really different .
the biggest difference between them is in their treatment of time .
from the point of view of the self that has experiences , if you have a vacation , and the second week is as good as the first one , then these two weeks @-@ week vacation are twice as good at comparison to a vacation of a week .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all i remember .
for me , remember , two weeks of vacation are just better than the vacation of a week because you don &apos;t break new memories .
the story has not changed .
and in this way , time is really the fundamental variable that distinguishes the self that reminds of the self that has experiences . time has very little impact on this story .
now , the self that reminds more than remember and storytelling .
in fact , it &apos;s the one who makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two <unk> with two different surgeons , and he has to decide which of them to pick , then , he &apos;ll stick to that surgeon who has a less <unk> to that surgeon .
the self that has experiences has no voice or no vote in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think about our future normally in terms of experiences .
we think of our future in terms of predictable memories .
and in essence , you can see it , as a tyranny of me , and you can think of it , you know , it reminds me of the self that has experiences to have experiences that it doesn &apos;t really need .
i have the feeling that when we go on holiday this is a very prevalent case , i mean , we go on holiday , largely , on the service of myself remember .
and i think this is a little difficult to justify to justify it .
i mean , how much do we think about our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that you give for the domain of the self , remember .
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that we had in antarctica a few years ago , that were definitely the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think about them in relative to how much i think about other vacation .
and i would probably have thought about my memories of that three @-@ week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 photos on it , i would have spent another time .
that &apos;s for three weeks , and it &apos;s about an hour and a half .
there seems to be a fault .
well , i may seem a little bit extreme , in the very few people , i have to think about my memory , but even if i consider it more time , there is an important question : why do we give our memories so much importance to the importance that we give the experiences ?
so i want you to take an experiment on thought .
imagine that in your next <unk> that at the end of your holiday all your photos are inserted , and you will give you a drug <unk> so you wouldn &apos;t buy anything .
now , do you take the same holiday ?
and if you go on a different holiday , there would be a conflict between your two <unk> , and you have to think about how you manage that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not that obvious , because if you did it in terms of time , then you &apos;ll have an answer . and if you translate it in terms of memories , you &apos;ll get another answer .
why do we choose the holidays we chose ? it &apos;s a problem that takes us back to an election between the two <unk> .
now , the two <unk> perform two notions of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can <unk> for each of us .
so you can ask : how happy are the self that has experiences ?
and then you get confused : how are you happy in the life of the self that has experiences ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness at every time is a pretty complicated process .
what emotions can be measured ?
and by the way , we are now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from me that has experiences over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the self that remember , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
it &apos;s not about how a person is happy .
it &apos;s about how they content a person when they think about their life .
a very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t penetrate these concepts , will be confused into the study of happiness , and i belong to a group of <unk> , who have been confused into the study of happiness for a long time because of it .
the distinction between the happiness of me that has experiences and the satisfaction of the self that remember has been recognized in the last few years , and are currently treated to measure both by the split .
the gallup organization does a global survey with over half a million people who have asked them about what they think of their life and their experiences , and there have been other embellishments in that sense .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two <unk> .
and the main lesson i think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how content someone &apos;s in your life , and that doesn &apos;t really tell you a great thing about whether they &apos;re living their lives in a happy way , and vice versa .
to give an idea of correlation , correlation is 0.5 .
what it means is that if you met somebody , and they told you , oh my father is six feet tall , how much do you know about his height ?
well , you know something about your height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
you still have a lot of uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody <unk> their life with eight on a scale of ten , there &apos;s still a lot of uncertainty about what &apos;s happy about what it is with me that it has experiences .
so the correlation is lower .
we know something about what controls the joy of self .
we know that the money is very important , our goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically being satisfied by people we like to be , spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasures , but this is the dominant one .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two <unk> , you want to make things very different .
the conclusion of what i said here is that you shouldn &apos;t really think of happiness as a substitute for welfare .
it &apos;s a completely different concept .
now , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we really live .
so if you ask simply how happy people are , you &apos;re not going to get a right answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in california , what if you live in ohio , say .
and what happens is when you think about life in california , you &apos;re thinking about the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast is , for example , climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for me that has experiences and it &apos;s not even very important for me to think that it &apos;s deciding how happy people are .
now , because the self that you step back is the one that sends , you can end -- some people can end to california .
and it &apos;s interesting to discover what happens to people who move to california with the hope of being happier .
well , her self that has experiences is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but it &apos;s going to happen one thing . they &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because , when you think about it , you &apos;ll remember how awful it was in ohio , and you &apos;ll think you &apos;ll make the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think about the welfare , and i hope to give you an idea of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you very much .
when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned that there was a very interesting outcome that arose from the gallup poll .
is there something that can tell you , because you still have a while left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting outcome that we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number , not surprising to find at all .
we find that number with respect to the happiness of the self that has experiences .
when we look at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that , below about 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , around 200,000 , is a representative sample significantly , below a few dollars a year .
60,000 60 .
<unk> : 60,000 <unk> .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they are more unhappy as poor they are .
but above that threshold , we get a completely flat line .
i mean , a few times i &apos;ve seen so flat lines .
obviously what happens is that money doesn &apos;t buy the happiness of our experiences , but the lack of money makes misery , and we can measure that misery very precisely .
in terms of the other self , the one who remembers , the story is different .
the more money you make more content for these .
that doesn &apos;t work for emotions .
but danny , the main american political endeavor focuses on life , freedom and search for happiness .
if people take this statement seriously , it seems to me to translate everything we believe about , say , the fiscal policy and issues like that .
is there any chance that politicians , who are in general , i took this conclusion seriously and established public policy based on her ?
dw : you know that i think there &apos;s a role of the research of happiness in public policy .
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , there &apos;s no doubt of it , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s recognizing , and in other countries it &apos;s recognizing .
people recognize that they have to think about happiness when they think about public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while and people are going to discuss whether they want to study the happiness of our experiences , or whether they want to study the <unk> of life , so we have to have that debate pretty soon .
how do you increase happiness , you see it differently depending on what you think and whether you do it about the self that you remember , or the self that has experiences .
that &apos;s going to influence public policy , i think , in the next years , it &apos;s going to influence public policy .
in the united states , it &apos;s trying to measure the experience of the population .
this will form , in the next decade or the next decade , part of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , that this subject will be , or at least it should be , the most interesting political argument to develop over the next few years .
thank you very much for inventing the behavioral economics .
thank you danny <unk>
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal , a game designer .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years ; my goal for the next decade is to try to make the world so easy to save the real life as it is in the world of online games .
and i have a plan to do that , and that &apos;s supposed to convince more people to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
today , we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you may be thinking , &quot; this is a lot of time to play games . &quot;
maybe too long , consider the number of problems that you have to solve in the real world .
but actually , according to my research , at the institute for <unk> actually the opposite occurs .
three billion hours a week is not enough play to solve the most intractable problems .
in fact , i think if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase that radically .
i &apos;ve calculated the full need in 21 billion hours of play per week .
it &apos;s probably an intuitive idea , so i &apos;ll say again , that makes a dent . if we want to solve problems like hunger , climate change , global conflicts , i think we have to aim the internet at least 21 billion hours a week for the end of the next decade .
no , i &apos;m serious .
here &apos;s why , this image sums up a lot of why i think games are essential for the future survival of the human species . really .
this is a portrait of a photographer called phil <unk> .
he wanted to capture the emotion of play , so he put a camera in front of the players while he was playing .
this is a classic emotion in games .
now , if you don &apos;t play a few nuances in this picture .
you probably see the sense of urgency maybe a little bit of fear , but intense concentration to tackle a really complex problem .
if you would play <unk> here some nuances , the guts of your eyes and around your mouth is a sign of optimism , and your eyebrows up is surprise .
this is a player about something called <unk> triumph .
you &apos;ve heard that . ok . so there &apos;s players among us .
the winning is an extraordinarily positive outcome that you didn &apos;t know was possible until you succeeded .
i was almost beyond what you think .
and when you get to that , you &apos;re surprised to find out what you were able . that &apos;s a saving triumph .
this is a player on the edge of a mediterranean triumph .
and this is the face that we need to see in millions of solve problems all over the world as we measure the next @-@ century obstacles , the face of somebody who , against all kinds of bet , is on the edge of a winning triumph .
unfortunately , this is the face we most see in everyday life when we try to address pressing problems .
this is what i call &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i &apos;m not a good thing in life , and this is me putting that face up . right ? yeah , good .
that &apos;s me putting a face of &quot; i &apos;m not great in life . &quot;
this is a graffiti graffiti in my former berkeley neighborhood , california , where i did my ph.d of why we are better at games than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we feel that we &apos;re not so good at the reality of games .
and i &apos;m not just saying good in terms of success , even though it &apos;s part of that .
we do more in game worlds , but i also want to say good in terms of motivation to do something important than inspire us to collaborate and cooperate .
and when we are in the worlds of games , i think a lot of us back the best version of ourselves , the most willing to help instantly , the toughest to follow with a problem that we need , to get up after we fail and to try again .
and in real life , when we fail , when we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re both concerned , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing online simply doesn &apos;t exist on games .
so i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what kind of games makes us feel -- there &apos;s nothing we can &apos;t do with it ?
how can we take those feelings of the games and challenge the work of the real world ?
so let &apos;s look at games like world of warcraft , which is really an ideal @-@ solving environment .
and i started looking at some things that make the success possible on the online worlds .
the first is that , whenever you get into one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters willing to immediately benefit from a mission that will destroy the world .
but not any mission , but a mission that was seamlessly at the current level of one in the game , right ?
so you can do it .
you never get a challenge you can &apos;t get .
but it &apos;s the limit of what you &apos;re capable of , so you have to contend with , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
there &apos;s no such thing to sit at <unk> your hands ; there &apos;s always something specific and important to do .
and there &apos;s also a bunch of collaborators .
wherever you go , there are hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to get your epic mission .
it &apos;s not something that we have in real life so easily this sense that in the palm of hand , there &apos;s a lot of collaborators .
and there &apos;s also this epic story , this inspiring history of why we are there , what we &apos;re doing .
and then there &apos;s all that positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about raising levels and force + one , and intelligence + one .
we don &apos;t have that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when i leave the stage , i &apos;m not going to take an + 1 , a crazy idea , or a crazy idea , 20 + 20 .
i don &apos;t have that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with online collaborative settings like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so successful to be on the edge of a commons , all the time we decided to spend all our time on these <unk> worlds .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so far , together , all the players in world of warcraft have spent millions of years solving the virtual problems with <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily bad .
it might seem bad .
but to put it into context : <unk> million years ago our human ancestors stood up .
that was the first primate walk .
so when we talk about how much time we invest in online games , the only way that it makes sense to even think about it , is to talk about time in the magnitude of human evolution that &apos;s extraordinary .
but it &apos;s something right . because it turns out that all this time playing online , we &apos;re actually changing what we &apos;re capable of doing as human beings .
we &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and <unk> type .
it &apos;s true . i believe this .
consider this really interesting statistic . it was published recently by a carnegie mellon researcher , the average boy today in a country with <unk> culture will be 10,000 hours playing online for the 21st years .
now , 10,000 hours is actually an interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for the kids in the u.s. <unk> hours , it &apos;s the exact time that will be in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if they have perfect assistance .
so we have a whole parallel education going on where young people learn so much about what &apos;s needed to be a good player in the same way as everything else in school .
probably many of you have read the new book by <unk> gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
you &apos;ve heard about your theory of the success theory of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on this great research of cognitive science that if we can over 10,000 hours of biomedical study , in something that &apos;s 21 years old , we &apos;ll be <unk> on that .
we will be so good at what we do as the world &apos;s greatest person .
and , now we think about that , there &apos;s an entire generation of young players that are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are these players getting so good ? &quot;
because if we could know that we would have something virtually unprecedented these human resources in our hands .
this is how we now have a lot of people in the world who spend at least an hour playing online .
it &apos;s our players <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion extremely good players in whatever .
if you don &apos;t know it anymore , it &apos;s coming .
the game industry is developing <unk> that consume low energy and function with wireless networks instead of the broadband internet so that the players of the particular world of india , china , brazil , can access .
you expect a billion players in the next decade .
it will lead us to 1.5 billion players .
so i began to think about , what these games make us improvise .
here &apos;s the four things i found . the first one is the urgent optimism .
ok , think of this as a high @-@ tech car .
the urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to overcome a underlying <unk> with the belief that we have a reasonable success .
players always believe that it &apos;s possible a win @-@ win triumph and it &apos;s always worth trying , and doing it now .
they &apos;re not sitting there without doing anything .
players are <unk> <unk> to the social plot .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that show that we like people after playing with them even if they &apos;ve won us .
and the reason is that it demands a lot of trust to play a game with somebody .
we trust that they &apos;re going to spend their time with us that they &apos;re going to play under the same rules to value the same target , they will stay in the game until the end .
so playing a game together actually builds ties , confidence and cooperation .
and as a result , we construct stronger social relationships .
productivity <unk> . i love .
there &apos;s one reason why the average player of warcraft plays 22 hours a week like a middle @-@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know , when we play a game , we &apos;re actually happier working a lot , relaxed or hanging out .
we know that we are <unk> , as humans , making a meaningful job .
players are willing to work a lot of the time , if you give them the right work .
finally , the elusive purpose .
players love amazing human stories by <unk> .
so , some data to put that in perspective . everyone knows the wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki in the world , with about 80,000 papers is the guinness world of warcraft .
five million people use a month .
there &apos;s more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other sub @-@ ever @-@ covered information on any other wiki in the world .
they &apos;re building a epic story .
they &apos;re building a resource of knowledge by world of warcraft .
well , these are four superpowers coming to be one thing . players are optimistic individuals with superpowers .
they are people who believe that they are capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist named edward <unk> .
their work is brilliant . he studies why people spend so much time , energy , and money on online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we are seeing quantities -- not lower to a mass <unk> -- to virtual worlds and online . &quot;
and it &apos;s an economist , and therefore rational .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a game designer , i &apos;m a <unk> .
but he says that this has all the sense because players can achieve more in virtual worlds than in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games that can have in real life . they have better feedback and they feel more rewarded in the games that in real life .
so he says that right now it makes all the sense that players spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world .
i also think that &apos;s rational , right now .
but it &apos;s not , in any way , an ad situation .
we have to begin to make the real world more like a game .
i was inspired by something that happened 2,500 years ago .
these are old @-@ fashioned , made out of <unk> sheep . right ?
before the fantastic tv controllers , we had <unk> .
and these represent the first game @-@ engineered team by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historian , you know this story . it &apos;s the story of who and why games were invented .
<unk> says that games , in particular , were invented in the kingdom of deals with a famine period .
apparently there was a famine so severe famine that the king of people had decided they had to do something crazy .
people suffered . people suffered .
it was an extreme situation . they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to <unk> , the inspired @-@ by @-@ way game was constructed , a policy in the entire kingdom : one day , everybody would eat . and the next day , everybody would eat .
and you would be so <unk> in the start of it because games are so attractive , and you dip into such a <unk> productivity and you would have a great deal of <unk> .
and then the next day , i will spend playing the day playing , and the other day they feed .
and according to <unk> , they lived 18 years from this form , surviving famine on a day , playing the next day .
i think that &apos;s exactly the way games are used today .
we play to escape the suffering of the real world .
we use games to get rid of all what &apos;s broken in the real environment , all we don &apos;t get tired of the real world and we take what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is very exciting .
according to <unk> , after 18 years famine had not <unk> , so the king decided that they would hold a end of dice .
we will split to two parts the entire kingdom .
they played a <unk> and the winners of the game will play into a epic adventure .
they would leave , and they would continue to look for a new home , leaving enough people to survive with the available resources , and hopefully take civilization to some place where they could thrive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , evidence of dna has shown that the <unk> that were mapped into the <unk> empire actually shared the same dna with the ancient <unk> .
and therefore , recently , scientists have suggested that the crazy story of <unk> is true .
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted about 20 years , which would explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
you might have really saved your culture by playing games for 18 years , and then as inspired as they knew as much as going forward with games that actually saved all civilization in this way .
well , we can do it .
we &apos;ve played world since 1994 .
it was the first game of strategy in real time of the world series of warcraft . that was 16 years ago .
they played out for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
they had half the civilization outside of a new world , and that &apos;s where i have my 21 billion hours a week of games .
we will spend half of us spend an hour playing games to solve real world problems .
i know you &apos;re asking yourself , &quot; how are we going to solve real problems in the real world ? &quot; well , i &apos;ve spent my work over the last few years at the institute for <unk> .
we have this poster in our front office and express our vision of how we should relate to the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to predict the future .
what we want is to make the future .
we want to imagine the result of the best scenario of a case , and then we encourage people to make reality that outcome .
we want to imagine <unk> victories , and then we want to give people the media for <unk> victories .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games i &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the media to create therapeutic gains in their future .
this is &quot; world without <unk> . &quot;
we did this game in 2007 .
this is an online game that you &apos;re trying to survive an oil <unk> .
the oil <unk> is <unk> , but we put enough online content there to make it real and live its real lives as if oil was done , so when they go into the game , they tell us where they live . and then we spent them in real @-@ time sources that show exactly how much oil is being done , how life is being burned , and it affects the transportation .
we did a players with fans in 2007 , and we followed them for three years .
and i can tell you , it &apos;s a transformative experience .
no one wants to change the way of life only because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to do it .
but if you immerse them in a epic adventure and say , &quot; we are left without oil . &quot;
this is an astonishing story and an adventure for you to engage .
tell yourself to survive in that world . a lot of players have kept their habits in this game .
so for the next game we looked at the world , we decided to aim higher , a bigger problem for oil .
we did a game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for <unk> .
the premise was that a supercomputer has calculated that humans only 23 years ago on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the world peace telescope , of course .
we asked people to build online , almost like an jerry <unk> movie .
you know , in the movies of jerry <unk> , they form an ideal team . they have the astronaut , the scientist , the former <unk> , they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people in the ideal team , we said , they &apos;re all in the ideal team , and it &apos;s your goal to invent the future of energy , the future of food , of health , the future of security and the social safety network .
we did play eight people that game for eight weeks .
there were 500 creative <unk> solutions that can go and see if they &apos;re going to &quot; <unk> . &quot;
finally , the last game . we &apos;re launching march 3 : this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you end the game , you will be certified by the institute of the world bank , as a social , 2010 .
working with the universities of all sub @-@ saharan africa , and we are encouraged to learn the skills of social innovation .
we have a graphic . we have <unk> in skills like local knowledge , networks of knowledge , sustainability , vision and engineering .
i &apos;d like to invite all of you to share , please , this game with young people all over the world , in particular areas of development that could benefit from the union to try to begin to imagine their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to take you now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think is going to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have all these games that are the drivers of what could be done , but no one has yet saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are a human resource we can use in real world jobs that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these <unk> superpowers , the ability to spin a solid social , this kind of urgent optimism , and the desire of the <unk> purpose .
i really hope that together we can play games that we could play , to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you &apos;ll join me and play games like this .
when i look over the next decade , i know two things with security : we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play all kinds of games that we can play .
so i say , let &apos;s start the games that change the world .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i did a few months while i was writing an article for the italian editing of wired magazine .
i always have my <unk> <unk> by hand when i &apos;m writing something , but i &apos;d finished edit my article when i realized i &apos;d never in my life , i &apos;d ever looked for the word &quot; disabled , &quot; to see what .
let me read you what it says .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> &quot; : &quot; <unk> , helpless , horribly , destroyed , battered , injured , injured , <unk> , maimed , drunk , starvation , dairy , dairy , paralyzed , paralyzed , haunted , haunted , haunted , haunted , haunted , <unk> , covered , covered with nerves , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> and weak .
<unk> , healthy , strong , able . &quot;
i was reading this in the voice of a friend , and at the beginning i was laughing , i was so ridiculous , but i had just read &quot; <unk> , &quot; when my voice was broken and i had to stop and i had to stop and i had the emotional crash and the impact that the hallways of <unk> .
you know , of course , this was my old old <unk> . i thought i had to be an old , of course .
but in fact , it was an issue of the early 1980s when i was supposed to be the primary school and i had an idea of myself outside the family &apos;s core , and in relation to the other kids and the world around me .
and the more you say , thank god i didn &apos;t use a <unk> in that day .
i mean , according to this definition , i would seem to be born in a world that somebody like me has absolutely nothing positive to give her , when , in fact , i &apos;m famous for the opportunities and adventures that my life has brought me .
so , immediately i went to look at the online issue of 2009 , hoping to find a fit of being considered .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this word .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; particularly &quot; complete &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just a question of words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we talk to them with these words .
it &apos;s about values behind words , and how we construct those values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world , and how we see other people .
in fact , a lot of old societies , including the romans and the romans , believed that the <unk> were very powerful , because they were cooking in the voice high .
so what is the reality that we want to create , the one person who is limited , or the one person who has control itself ?
by the mere fact of making something as simple as a name of a person , a child , we might be able to stand up and eradicate its capability .
wouldn &apos;t we want , instead , to open up gates ?
one person like this , which opened my childhood doctor at the institute , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
his name is dr. <unk> . an italian @-@ origin american , whose name was apparently too difficult to say to most of his americans , so he would make it just dr. <unk> .
and the t was always using very colorful <unk> and had the perfect <unk> to work with children .
i enjoyed most of the time i spent in the hospital , except for my session at <unk> .
i had to do what seemed to me to do with these thick rubber bands -- of different colors -- you know , to help strengthen the muscles of my legs , and i hated these bands more than anything else , i hated them , i hated them . i hated them .
and , you know , i was already disillusioned with just five years of age , dr. p to try to stop doing these exercise , no success , of course .
and one day , she came to my session -- <unk> and <unk> , and she told me , &quot; ah , aimee , you &apos;re so potent , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
when i rescued it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple <unk> part of dr. p for me to get the exercise i didn &apos;t want to do before the possibility of being the five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the second floor , but what he actually did for me was to transform an event that was awful in a very good experience for me .
and i have to ask myself today , how far your vision is , and i had a strong , powerful child , empowering my view of myself in the future as a strong , strong , strong , talented person .
this is an example of how adults in power positions can light the energy of a child .
however , in the definitions of <unk> that we saw previously , our language does not allow us to develop into the reality that we all love , the possibility that one person can see itself as capable .
our language has not been put on the day with the changes in our society , many of which have been caused by technology .
certainly , from a medical perspective , my legs , laser surgery to improve vision , the receptors of knee and hip @-@ shaped titanium made out of <unk> people , all of which are allowing people to develop more their faculties , and move beyond the boundaries that nature has imposed on them , without giving them the social networking , which allow people to create one of themselves .
so , maybe the technology is giving us now more clearly , what has always been a true , that every person has become unusual and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to cooperate is the biggest advantage we have .
the human ability to adapt , which is interesting , because people have always wanted to talk to me about overcome adversity , and i &apos;m going to admit something . that sentence never <unk> with me , and i always felt uncomfortable trying to answer the questions of people about it , and i think i &apos;ll begin to realize why .
in this particular phrase of <unk> , there is the idea that success , or happiness , is through a controversial challenge , or without being affected by the experience , as if my successes in life were the result of a life to fight or to <unk> the difficulties in a lifetime or what other people perceive as my disability .
however , in fact , we are <unk> . we are affected , of course , by a challenge , be physical , emotionally , or both forms .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adversity is not a barrier that we need to <unk> our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of this as if it were my shadow .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and certainly , i &apos;m not trying to minimize the impact , the weight , the fight of one person .
there are adversity and challenges in life , and it &apos;s a different reality for every person , but the question isn &apos;t whether you go or not to have to confront adversity , but how you &apos;re going to go .
so , our responsibility is not simply to isolate the adversity from those who we want to , but to make sure we manage it well .
and we don &apos;t do them any favors by our children when we make them feel they &apos;re not equipped to fit .
there &apos;s an important difference between the fact that i have the right legs and the subjective opinion of society about whether i am or not disabled .
and , really , the only real and consistent disability that i &apos;ve had to deal with in front of is that the world would think those definitions describe me .
in our desire to protect those who we love to give them the cold and cold truth about their doctor or a life @-@ quality forecast that they might expect , we must make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick into a wall that ultimately <unk> somebody .
maybe the existing model of just looking at what is damaged in you and how to fix it , causes the older disability than the pathology itself .
in the absence of treating the person in their totality , not to recognize their potential , we &apos;re creating another evil about any natural fights that can already have .
we &apos;re putting a score on the value someone has for our community .
so we need to see beyond pathology and within the range of human capability .
and more importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those <unk> and our greatest creative ability .
so it &apos;s not about seoul , or denial , those moments of greater trial as something we want to avoid or hide , but rather than that , it &apos;s about finding those opportunities that are hidden within adversity .
so , maybe , the idea i want to express is , not so much to overcome adversity , but the <unk> of it , <unk> it , to use a term of the professional struggle , maybe even , <unk> with it .
and , perhaps , if we see adversity as a natural , consistent and useful , we will be less for their presence .
this year , we celebrated 200 years of the birth of charles darwin , and 150 years ago , when i was writing about evolution , darwin put on manifest , i think , a truth about the character of human beings .
to make it , it &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , it &apos;s not the most clever one that lives , it &apos;s the most intelligent that it &apos;s ever changed , but it &apos;s that it fits better .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , among others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and thrive is driven by the fight of the human spirit through conflict and towards transformation .
so again , the transformation , the adaptation , is our greatest human ability .
and maybe it &apos;s not until we &apos;re fearful , we know what we &apos;re made .
maybe this is what adversity gives us , a sense of &quot; itself , &quot; a sense of our own power .
so , we can give you a gift .
we can rethink adversity as something more than just difficult times .
maybe we can see it as a change .
adversity is only a change that we have not yet adapted to .
i think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created is the idea of normal .
say , who is normal ?
there isn &apos;t normal enough .
there &apos;s the common . there &apos;s the typical ; there &apos;s no normal thing . and , do you want to meet those poor people , color <unk> , if you eat them ?
i think no .
if we can change this paradigm and move from one which is to reach the normal to another possibilities , or by force , to be a little more risky , we can release the power of so many other kids , and invite them to put the service of the community those weird and valuable skills that they own .
anthropologists tell us that what we have always wanted from the members of our community is that they are useful , that they are able to contribute .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , attribute their elders to their elders , and those with serious physical injuries , perhaps given that the expertise of survival in the life of these people proved to be of value for the community .
they didn &apos;t see these people as damaged or useless ; they looked at them as unusual and valuable .
a few years ago , i was at a food market in the village where i grew up in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a tomato package .
i was summer . i had a few short pants .
i hear this guy , speaking backstage behind me , &quot; well , if this is not aimee . &quot;
and i go back , and it &apos;s this old man . i have no idea who he is .
and i say , &quot; sorry , sir , do we know ? i don &apos;t remember . &quot;
and he says , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think you remember when i met .
i mean , when we met , he was fed on the belly of your mother . &quot;
oh , that person .
and , of course , i realized there .
it was dr. <unk> , who i knew only through the stories that my mother told me about that day , because , of course , as it &apos;s custom in me , i came two weeks later to my birth .
so the <unk> doctor of my mother had gone on holiday , so the man who made my birth was a complete stranger for my parents .
and because i was born without the bones of the <unk> , and i had the feet attached to it , and a few fingers on this foot , and a few in this one , he had to be who he took , this strange one had to be who took the bad news .
he told me , &quot; i had to give you the forecast of your parents that you would never know , and that you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids had or no kind of living , and you &apos;ve been dressed as a liar from that moment . &quot;
what was extraordinary is that he told me that he had a newspaper tax on the length of my childhood , whether it was out of when i won a crisis to spell it in second grade , solely on the <unk> <unk> , you know , at the <unk> meeting , when i won my university grant , or any of my papers , and he used this material , and he appealed to his medical conferences .
and he called this part of the course of the x , the potential of the human will .
no forecast can determine how powerful this can be as a key to the quality of a person &apos;s life .
and dr. <unk> kept telling me , &quot; in my experience , unless you get too many times the opposite , and even if you give it a minimum support , if you let it go alone , a child will get the success . &quot;
you see , dr. <unk> made that change of thought .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the health problem and what one person can do despite the same .
and i myself have changed my way to think about time , because if i had asked myself when i was 15 years old , if i had changed my prostheses of the skin and bone , i wouldn &apos;t have conceived of a second .
at that time , i accused that kind of normal .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not despite the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and perhaps , this change in my mind has occurred because i &apos;ve been in contact with more people who have opened doors for me than who have put <unk> and shadows on my own .
you know , all you need is a person opening your eyes to your own power , and you take off .
if you could give somebody the key to their own power , the human spirit is so responsive , if you could do that and open a door to somebody at a crucial time , you &apos;re holding them in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching yourself open doors .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; <unk> &quot; comes from the root &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means , stimulate what &apos;s inside , manifest the potential .
so again , what is the potential that we want to put on a manifest ?
there was a case studio in britain , in the 1960s , when the area was changing the income system at the high school , of one that was required to transfer of income to another which was open .
that &apos;s what they call the testing of separation in groups . here in the united states , we call it <unk> .
it &apos;s about separating students in a , b , c , etc .
and the students a get the toughest curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took students from the vitamin d level , and for a three @-@ month period , they gave them the highest notes , they told them they were students on the level a , they told them they were brilliant , and at the end of that three @-@ month period , they were giving up on an a.
and of course , the <unk> <unk> of this study , they took the students from the level a and they told them they were on the level of d.
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three @-@ month period .
with those who were still in school , in addition to the ones who had already left behind .
one crucial part of this case study was that teachers were also deceived .
teachers didn &apos;t know that there was a change made .
they just told them that these were the students a , and these were the students , &quot; d. &quot; and that &apos;s how students were encouraged to teach them and show themselves .
so , i think the only real disability is a <unk> spirit , a spirit that has been <unk> has no hope . it doesn &apos;t see beauty . it doesn &apos;t have our natural curiosity , child and our ability to imagine .
if , instead of that , we can <unk> a human spirit to have hope , to see beauty in itself and others , to be imaginative and curious , then we &apos;re really using our power .
when a spirit has those qualities , we are able to create new realities and new ways of being .
i would like to leave you with a poem by a persian poet in the fifth century , called <unk> of who told me my friend , jacques <unk> . and the poem is called , &quot; god knows only four <unk> . &quot; every child has known to god , not the god of the other names , not the god who can &apos;t do , but the god knows that four words .
come up and dance with me . thank you .
would you like to be better than what you are ?
suppose i told you that , with only a few changes in your genes , they could improve memory -- by one more precise , more accurate and faster .
or maybe you &apos;d like to be in better shape , be stronger , to have more resistance .
would you like to be more attractive and confident ?
how about living more with good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re those people who were always getting more creative .
what else would you like ?
what would you like , if you could choose something ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
hands up . let me see .
a few . you probably owe the number of creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would choose the memory ?
a few more .
and the physical state ?
a little less .
how about longevity ?
ah , most . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
if you could have some of this , the world would be very different .
is it just imagination ?
or maybe it &apos;s possible ?
evolution has been a theme here at the ted conference , but i want to look at a physician on the subject .
the great 20th century , <unk> <unk> , which also <unk> in the most unorthodox <unk> church , wrote an essay entitled &quot; nothing in biology has felt to the light of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re from those people who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a good time to switch off the hearing aids , and i give you the evidence of biological evolution , and maybe we &apos;ll remove the book of <unk> about being wrong because , none of the rest of this talk is going to make a little sense for you .
but if you actually accept biological evolution , consider this : is it only the past , or the future ?
is it about the others or us ?
this is another looking at the tree of life .
in that picture , i put a bush in the center of it , because if we look at the edges of the tree of life , every species in the back of those branches has been successful in evolutionary terms , it has survived ; it has demonstrated an adaptation to its environment .
the human part of this branch , well at one end , is , of course , the most we &apos;re interested in .
it &apos;s from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
at the time , there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some have gone and back .
we &apos;ve been here about <unk> years .
we may seem to be far away from other parts of this tree of life , but actually most of our basic machinery of our cells is about the same .
do you notice that we can exploit and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that &apos;s used to treat diabetes ?
this is not like human insulin , but it &apos;s the same protein , chemically <unk> , the one that comes out of the pancreas .
and talking about bacteria -- do you realize that we all carry in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body ?
maybe 10 times more .
i mean , think -- when antonio <unk> tells you about the self @-@ image -- do you think about bacteria ?
the gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , dark , wet . it &apos;s very <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to give you all the nutrients that you can want without effort in your part .
it &apos;s actually like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some kind of rush to the output .
but , on the other hand , we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life .
they help digest essential nutrients , and they protect us from certain diseases .
but what would we regret the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species ?
or should it be destined to become something different , something that might be better adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s take a step back in time , the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of proto @-@ life may be three to four billion years ago in <unk> the first <unk> organisms , maybe about 800 to 1,000 million years ago , and then the human species appears to be shown .
in this vast <unk> symphony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief compass ; the animal kingdom , like one and only one singular , and human life , a little note of it .
that was us .
and it was also the entertaining part of this talk , so i hope you loved it .
when i first went to college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something fundamental : most of the existence of life , in the one @-@ celled organisms , each cell just divides and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted by the two daughters .
but when the multicellular organisms appear , things start changing .
it enters the sex reproduction .
and one very important thing : with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome , the rest of the body becomes <unk> .
in fact , one could say that the body &apos;s death goes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction .
i have to claim that when i was a college student , i thought , well , death / death , sex / death , death by sex ; it seemed rather reasonable at that time , but every year i &apos;d spent , every single time i was more likely .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns , which was still acting in las vegas in his 90s .
and one night , someone hits his hotel door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , there &apos;s a wonderful dancer of clothes .
he looks at it , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m in finding a sex soup . &quot;
&quot; okay , &quot; george says , &quot; i pick the soup . &quot;
i realized , as a doctor , who was working on a different goal to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contradictory , just different .
i was trying to preserve the body .
he wanted us to be healthy .
i wanted to get health into the disease .
he wanted us to live more and healthier .
evolution consists of passing the genome into the next generation -- doubling and generation after generation .
from an evolutionary perspective , you and i are like <unk> rockets that are designed to sail the genetics at the next orbital level , and then let us fall to the sea .
i think everyone <unk> the feeling that woody allen said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
i want to make you not dying . &quot;
evolution not necessarily encourages longevity .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily necessarily replace the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the smartest .
evolution encourages the best @-@ adapted creatures into its environment .
that &apos;s the only proof of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> they would produce , if there were fish there , cooked <unk> , yet they &apos;ve managed to make that a <unk> environment .
so , what does this mean , when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the human location in evolution and in particular , if we look forward to the next phase -- i would say there &apos;s a lot of possibilities .
the first one is , don &apos;t <unk> .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the underlying thought would be that through medicine , in the first place , we have protected a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and removed from the population .
and secondly , as a species , we have <unk> our environment so that we <unk> ourselves as we adapt to it .
and by the way , by the way , <unk> , and we get so much left that it &apos;s no longer possible to have the isolation necessary to make evolution .
a second possibility is that there is a evolution of the traditional , natural , <unk> by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be : that the gears of evolution roll it slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and as soon as the isolation : as a sort of distant planets are going to exist , and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a attractive , intriguing and terrifying possibility .
i call it the &quot; neocortex , &quot; the new evolution , which is not simply natural -- but <unk> and by us as individuals in the decisions we will take .
now how could this happen ?
how could we get to do this ?
first consider the reality that many people today , in some cultures , are making decisions about their offspring .
in some cultures , they &apos;re choosing to have more boys than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily a good thing for society , but it &apos;s what &apos;s elected on an individual and family level .
think also , if it were possible to choose not only the sex of its offspring , but in its own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent disease .
what if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating <unk> ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if we look at the future , that kind of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human project began in 1990 , and he earned 13 years ago .
it took 6.3 million dollars .
in 2004 , i could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months .
today , you can get a complete sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near the $ 20,000 and anything in a week .
don &apos;t make it very much so that the human genome becomes more than 1,000 dollars and will be increasingly in the grasp of everyone .
just a week ago , there was a national <unk> academy of engineering and francis <unk> and <unk> <unk> , two scientists who developed techniques independently in order to make the evolutionary process go faster and give birth to proteins in a more efficient way , which <unk> calls &quot; evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the <unk> prize was awarded to the scientific <unk> by its research where he took an adult skin cell , a <unk> , and only four genes laid out that cell to become a mother <unk> : a capable , in power , any cell in the body .
those changes are coming .
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves , but they &apos;re going to engage other viruses .
believe it or there is no experimental trial that has the flu vaccine based on plant cells .
can you imagine something good that comes out of tobacco ?
that &apos;s actually today and in the future it &apos;s going to be increasingly possible .
so imagine just another two small changes .
they can change the cells in their bodies , but if they could change the cells of their offspring ?
and what if they could change sperm and <unk> , or change the newly <unk> , and give their children a better chance of a healthier life , eliminate diabetes , remove the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want children who are healthy ?
and then , that same analytical technology , that same engine of science that can produce change to prevent diseases will allow us to adopt super @-@ attributes -- a better memory .
why not have the ingenuity of a ken jennings sitting on everything if you could associate with the next generation of watson ?
why don &apos;t we have a push @-@ faster than can allow us to run faster and faster ?
why not live longer ?
this is going to be playful .
and when we are in conditions of pass this into the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to have created the evolution of before in the neocortex .
we &apos;re going to take a process that could usually take 100 years and we can charge it at 1,000 years , and maybe it will happen within the next 100 years .
these are choices that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have them .
are we going to use these choices in the annihilation of a better , more successful , more successful society ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for each other ?
are we going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust ?
this is the kind of question we &apos;re going to have to deal with .
and most profound of all , are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom required to make these predictable decisions ?
for good or for bad , and before you might think about , these choices are going to depend on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a robot that can be taken and gives you <unk> or another ability to make the wheelchair users stand up and stand up .
in <unk> , we call these robots , <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing different than something you put in the morning , it gives you a strong force , which also increases its velocity , and it helps , for example , to handle the balance .
it &apos;s actually true integration of man and machine .
but not only that -- you can integrate it and connect it to the universe and with other outside entities .
this is not an unreal idea .
to show you now in what we &apos;re working on , we &apos;re talking about the american soldier , on average , has to carry on his back a 45 @-@ pound load , and he &apos;s still getting equipment .
obviously , this leads to some important complications -- in the back , in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> damage .
we decided to contemplate this challenge and create a <unk> that could help deal with the issue .
let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or let me introduce the human <unk> .
with <unk> <unk> <unk> , i can 90 pounds across the terrain for many hours .
its flexible design , it allows you to fit into a lot of <unk> and perform movement with great agility .
it feels what i want to do , or where i want to go , and then it increases my force and my resistance .
we &apos;re ready , with our industrial partner , to produce this device , this new <unk> , this year .
i mean , it &apos;s a reality .
now let &apos;s look back into the wheelchair users , what i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are sixty @-@ eight million people around the world , around the world .
like one percent of the total population .
and this is a really conservative calculation .
we talk about something that often happens , very young people , damage to the spinal cord to begin their lives -- 20 , 30 or 40 years old -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair -- turns out to be their only choice .
we also talk about the aging population that &apos;s rapidly blown away .
its only option , many times -- because of a brain injury or some other complication -- it &apos;s the wheelchair .
and this has been the case for the last 500 years , from its successful emergence , as i should recognize .
so we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility .
let me introduce you to the <unk> that is using amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an uptake of the spinal cord , and as a result he couldn &apos;t walk back for 19 years , until now .
thank you .
so amanda is using our <unk> , which mentioned .
it has a few sensors .
completely non @-@ invasive on the crutches they send signals to the computer on board , here on the back .
there are also a few batteries that give you energy to the engines on the hip , and on the knees , and move it forward with this gentle , very natural gait .
i was 24 years old at the top of my life when , oddly enough jump in the air , during which , during which , during a jump , during the lower end of my life was paralyzed .
in a fraction of a second , i lost all sensation and all the movement from the pelvis down .
a little while later , a doctor came into my room at the hospital , and she told me , &quot; amanda , never let me walk . &quot;
that happened 19 years ago .
so he robbed me up to the last grain of hope of my being .
the <unk> technology , since then , has allowed me to learn how to stay underwater , climbing rocks and even building a hand bike .
but they haven &apos;t invented anything that allowed me to walk , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms for sitting and talking to you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not only by soldiers , but by amanda , and all the wheelchair users , all of us .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called robin <unk> .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting fires as a <unk> <unk> on a volunteer body .
and in our city , where volunteers are training a highly skilled staff , you have to get to the site of the very soon to get into action .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the site , so i had a fairly high probability of going .
but there was still a race on foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was .
when i found the <unk> , i was meeting in a conversation with the owner who surely passed one of the worst days of his life .
we were in the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the rain , under an umbrella , in <unk> , while her house was on fire .
the other volunteer who had just come before i did , <unk> <unk> <unk> came first to the captain and he asked her to come in and join the dog at home .
the dog ! i was so <unk> ! &quot;
there was a lawyer or <unk> of money that , for the rest of his life , he would have to tell people that came into a burning building to save a living only because he won me for five seconds .
well , i was the following .
the captain made me a <unk> .
he said , &quot; shawn , i need you to meet the house .
i need you to come up , put on fire , and i &apos;ll bring this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
it wasn &apos;t exactly what i expected , but i went up the stairs , at the end of the hall , i went to the actual <unk> that at that height , or at least they &apos;d finished turning the fire and i went into the main room for a couple of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i took my charge back on the stair where i met my <unk> and the lovely dog at the front door .
we took out of the house , the <unk> for the owner of the house where , as he was waiting , his treasure trove got much more attention than my treasure .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the courageous efforts to save his house .
the kindness she watched over the rest was that somebody had even played a pair of shoes .
both in my calling in robin <unk> as in my calling as a volunteer , i witnessed the acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but also acts of grace and courage on the individual level .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
everything has its importance .
so , when i look in this room to people who have done , or they &apos;re about to achieve , remarkable success levels , i &apos;d like to remind you this : not wait .
don &apos;t wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
if you have something to give , let me now .
we would feed food in a dining room , put a neighborhood park .
be mentors .
not every day we &apos;re going to have an opportunity to save someone &apos;s life , but every day we will be able to influence somebody &apos;s life .
so they go into play ; they save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women have the baton , they practice sex to say hello , and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not the <unk> man or san francisco festival .
ladies and gentlemen , you know your cousins .
this is the world of the wild bonobos ?
the bonobos are , along with the chimpanzees , their closest living relatives .
that means that we all share a common ancestry , an evolutionary grandmother , that lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve made too much focus on this regard in our narratives of human evolution .
but the bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large , terrifying , the bonobo is in charge of females with power .
these guys have created something special , because this leads to a very safe society where deadly violence has not yet been observed .
but unfortunately , the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes .
they live in the deep deep <unk> rainforest , and it &apos;s been very difficult to study them .
the drc is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the same -- stage of a violent conflict that has gone through many decades and causing nearly as many deaths as the first world war .
it &apos;s no surprise that this destruction also benefits the bonobo survival .
the trade of hunting and deforestation are made that you can &apos;t fill up a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world , and honestly , we &apos;re not sure about it .
however , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear something unseen the trees .
who are these cousins ?
we know them as the ape @-@ do @-@ love , not the war , because they have frequent sex , <unk> and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems .
i &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity , because the life of the bonobo is more than the <unk> .
the bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout your entire life .
play is not just a game of children .
for us and for them , the game is fundamental to create links and to encourage tolerance .
we learn from it , we learn to trust , and we learn the rules of play .
play increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look at the bonobo , you see the same evolutionary roots of laughter , the dance and the human ritual .
the game is the glue that unites us .
i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique videos carried out of the wild .
first , it &apos;s a bonobo @-@ name , and i don &apos;t talk about soccer .
here &apos;s a female and a male in the middle of a chase .
look what she &apos;s doing .
it could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase : &quot; it &apos;s held by the balls . &quot;
i just think in this case he loves it , right ?
yeah .
so sexual play is both common in bonobos and humans .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video is really interesting because it shows the fact of bringing unusual elements into the game , like the bloods and how play requires trust and commitment to confidence -- and at the same time , it &apos;s about the most fun .
but the game is deterministic .
the game is <unk> , it can adopt many forms , some of which are more <unk> , <unk> , curious -- maybe the place where the awe is going to be .
and i want you to see -- this is <unk> , a female who is playing with <unk> water .
i think , like her , sometimes we play alone , and we explored the boundaries of our inner , outer worlds .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity .
these are just little samples of the understanding that the bonobo gives us from our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future that we have to adapt to a world that is increasingly difficult with creativity and greater cooperation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capabilities .
in other words , play is our <unk> of <unk> .
to successfully adapt to a world that changes we need to play .
but do we force our game ability ?
the game is not <unk> .
the game is essential .
by bonobos and humans alike , life is not just cruel and wasteful .
when it seems the least appropriate to play , it can be the moments when it &apos;s the most urgent .
so , primates , let &apos;s accept this gift of evolution and play together while preserving creativity , friendship and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples in 1979 , the same day , exactly at the same time , every baby baby baby . okay .
so , two partners each with a baby .
i don &apos;t want you to get too arrested in the details of conception , because if you stop to think about understanding self , i won &apos;t pay attention .
let &apos;s think about that for a moment .
and in this scenario , i want you to imagine that , in one case , the sex chromosome holds together to the x @-@ chromosome .
and in the other case , the x @-@ chromosome joins the x @-@ chromosome of the egg .
both <unk> and life begins .
we will come back and talk about them later .
in my field , i play two roles .
in one of my roles , i work with the history of the anatomy .
i &apos;m <unk> by training , and what i study in this case is the way people portray the anatomy -- which is that , of human bodies and <unk> , how they &apos;ve looked at the body fluids , the idea of the body -- what they &apos;ve thought about the body .
the other role that performance in my work is the breast @-@ based , like <unk> of patients , as i say sometimes , <unk> people who are medical patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people whose physical characteristics defy the social standards .
i &apos;ve been working , for example , with identical twins , two people inside one body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> -- people who are much lower than the average .
and i worked with many cases of people with sex , individuals whose physical <unk> does not fit into the male and female <unk> .
in general lines , we can confirm them .
<unk> is adopting many forms .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn &apos;t fit into the common or a female form .
for example , there &apos;s the case of the individual with the <unk> <unk> <unk> gene with the y @-@ chromosome gene saying to the <unk> , which we all have in our lifetime , which are <unk> .
and then , in the <unk> life , the testes are producing testosterone .
but because this individual lacks the uptake of testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to the same .
it &apos;s <unk> syndrome .
so , there are high levels of testosterone , but without reaction .
as a consequence , the body develops following a typical feminine course .
when the baby is born , the baby looks like a child .
it &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a child .
and often , it &apos;s not until puberty , when it &apos;s growing and developing the breast , but it doesn &apos;t have the <unk> period , when somebody realize that something is happening .
and then after doing tests , you realize that instead of having a vacuum and a uterus , it actually has <unk> and a y.
the important thing to understand is that you can think of a man , but it &apos;s actually not .
women , like the men , have in the body something called <unk> glands .
they &apos;re in the back of the body .
kosher produce <unk> , the <unk> hormone .
most women like me -- i consider a typical woman ; she doesn &apos;t know her structure <unk> ; i think she &apos;s a typical woman , most women like me are sensitive to the <unk> .
we produce <unk> and we respond to <unk> .
as a consequence , somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman born with testes that has the <unk> syndrome given to the <unk> .
that &apos;s why sex is complicated . it &apos;s not that <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum -- in a way they can be everywhere .
another example : a few years ago , i received a call from a 19 @-@ year @-@ old boy and raised as a child , i had an girlfriend , and i had sex with her , had a life like a child , and i had just discovered that she had a bar and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an illness known as <unk> <unk> <unk> .
he had the 20th chromosomes and in utero the <unk> are so active that , essentially , created a male environment .
as a consequence , his <unk> were <unk> , his brain was exposed to the normal , traditional hormone component .
he was born with regard as a child ; nobody saw anything .
and it was at 19 years when doctors started having trouble accessing the internal <unk> , when doctors discovered that , in fact , it was women inside .
well , another quick example of a <unk> case .
some people with 20th chromosomes develop what &apos;s known as <unk> , which is , they have tissue shaped using <unk> tissue .
we don &apos;t know why that happens .
so , there are many varieties of sex .
the reason that children with this kind of bodies -- for example , twin twins , or <unk> , are treated at <unk> surgery , is not to be able to get rid of a better physical health .
in many cases , people are perfectly healthy .
the reason they settled on various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories .
the system is typically based on the idea that a particular anatomy carries a particular identity .
we have the idea that being a woman is having a female identity ; supposedly , black means having african anatomy in historical terms .
a terribly simplistic idea .
and when it presents a body that shows something quite different , we have problems with <unk> .
so we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk> .
our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic <unk> .
imagine how amazing it is to have children born as two people inside one body .
the recent highest case is from the past year with <unk> south african <unk> , put in the fabric of his sex at the international <unk> .
a lot of journalists called to say , &quot; what are you doing to determine whether <unk> is a man or a woman ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that there &apos;s no such exam .
in fact , we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t trace a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> ; we are the ones who draw that line .
so , what we have is a situation where the further we go through science , the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were stable <unk> categories -- are much more efficient than we thought .
and not only in terms of sex .
also in terms of race , which is much more complicated than the terminology allows .
as we see , we go into a rough terrain .
let &apos;s look , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the dna with the chimpanzees .
what about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk> ?
and as we move further into science , we get increasingly into a <unk> area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too infrequent .
and we &apos;re looking at this in every part of the human life .
one of them , for example , in our current culture , in the united states today , are the fights at the beginning and at the end of life .
it &apos;s hard to set a moment from which a body becomes human , and it has different rights to the fetuses .
there are very industrious discussions today that are <unk> not in the public , but also within homelessness in terms of when somebody considers themselves dead .
our ancestors had never met with this question of whether someone was dead .
and as a lot of them , they put a pen in front of the nose , and if they were still <unk> it .
if he stopped moving , he would stop him .
but today we can , for example , extract vital organs from one body and put them into another body .
and , as a consequence , we have to address the dilemma of actually determine the death of somebody , and it puts us in a hard situation where we don &apos;t have the simple categories of the past .
and you might think that this supernova explosion could surprise someone like me .
in politics , i am enlightened , <unk> people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit that i get nervous .
to highlight these categories are much more <unk> than i thought i &apos;d drive .
closed from the point of view of democracy .
and to tell you about this tension first , i have to admit that i am a <unk> of the founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were big .
i mean , they were so brave and courageous , and so radical in what they did , which i find myself so much watching that orange , not because of the music , which is completely silenced .
it &apos;s what happened in <unk> with the founding fathers .
founding fathers were , for me , the first activists of anatomy and explain why .
what they practiced was a <unk> concept , and they matched it with another which was radical and beautifully maintained for 200 years .
and , like all of you remember , what our founding fathers were the idea of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of the anatomy .
the old <unk> of the old world did not know the dna , but they had clearly the idea of the law of birth .
they had the concept of blue blood .
they were from the idea that the political power was hit by the right of the skull was passed by the father and then the child , etc .
founding fathers rejected that idea and <unk> by a new <unk> concept , and that was that all men are created the same .
they explored the play field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the anatomical differences . that was a very radical thing .
and in part , they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were being spent .
there was democracy and at the same time in science .
and it &apos;s very clear , if we look at the history of the founding fathers , that many of them were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world .
they were amazed by the <unk> explanation of <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> power passed by a vague idea of the right of birth .
they were moving towards a naturalist .
and if we look , for example , the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as a consequence , they were broadcast to us the idea of the <unk> coincidence .
and in doing so , they were <unk> the basis of the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
and what happened years later ?
it happened that women , for example , wanted the right to the vote , took the concept of the founding fathers of <unk> , was more important than the difference -- and they said , &quot; the fact that we have a uterus , and there &apos;s not a significant difference to restore the right to the vote , the right to a citizenship , the right , the property , etc . &quot;
and women were saving .
then the success of the civil rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> , who said , &quot; i &apos;m not a woman ? &quot;
we found men in the rows of the civil rights movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , the color people who resisted <unk> upon the difference of <unk> and , again , <unk> .
we see the same with the <unk> movement .
the problem is , of course , as we look at the coincidences , we have to begin to wonder why we hold certain divisions .
but attention , i want to keep some <unk> in our culture .
for example : i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t mean we should recognize ourselves in the anatomy .
i don &apos;t mean that five year @-@ olds should be allowed to have sex or married .
there are some divisions that make sense to me that we should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what they are , why keep them and if they make sense .
well , let &apos;s go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both <unk> in the mid @-@ 1979 exactly day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , mary , was born three months before time : june 1st of 1980s .
henry , on the contrary , was born in the term : march 1st of 1980 .
by the only fact that he was born three months earlier that mary translates to all rights three months before henry -- the right to sexual consent , the right to vote , the right to <unk> .
henry has to wait for all of that not because he &apos;s a different biological age , but he was born after .
we found other bookmobiles running around in terms of her rights .
henry , in virtue of being considered a man , i haven &apos;t told you whether he &apos;s overwhelmed , in virtue of being considered to be a man now , is to be evicted because he doesn &apos;t have to worry about it .
mary , on its part , has not the same rights as henry in every state , for example .
henry can get married in every state with a woman , but mary can marry a woman alone in a few states .
so , still , there are physiological categories that are in many ways around questionable and number of ways .
and now the question is , what do we do now that science would both decrease in the field of the anatomy , which we came to the point that having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could crumble ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time sometimes i feel like science gets us away .
where do we go ?
it seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic outlook : well , we have to draw the line in some part , so we &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
but a lot of people get stuck in a weird position .
for example : texas at some point has decided that to marry a man you don &apos;t have to have y @-@ chromosome and get married with a woman you have to have a pop @-@ up .
now , in practice , they don &apos;t do <unk> tests of people .
but this is also very strange , given the story that i told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , in his &quot; i <unk> <unk> &quot; offers a solution .
it says that we should address people , based on the color of their skin , but on the contents of their character , &quot; going beyond the anatomy .
and i mean , &quot; yeah , the idea looks really good . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do people base the content of their character ?
i want to argue also that i &apos;m not sure that we should address this to force people &apos;s rights , because i have to admit that i know some of the <unk> that probably deserve more of the social services than some humans i know .
i also mean that maybe some errands around me can make more decisions , intelligent and more <unk> about their sex relationships than 40 i know .
so how do you put it in practice the theme of character content ?
it &apos;s very difficult .
and one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of one person could be in the future be measured by an instrument , maybe with an mri .
do we really want to get to that point ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i do know is that it seems to be very important that the united states still has this current of thought in relation to the theme of democracy .
we &apos;ve done a good job in defense for democracy , and i think we &apos;re going to do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t live , for example , in a context like the iranian where a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed , unless you &apos;re willing to have a sex shift , in which case you can live .
we &apos;re not in that situation .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have a context like a surgeon i talked to a couple of years ago that i &apos;d done giving birth identical twins to then separate their fame .
but when i was on the phone , i asked him the reason why the surgery was very <unk> , he told me that in that country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore he had to do it .
what i said , &quot; well , have you considered the political asylum rather than the surgical separation ? &quot;
the united states provides enormous possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change by the well of the state .
so i think we have to be on the head .
well , to end up , i mean i &apos;ve been talking a lot about parents .
and i want to think about what democracy would be , or as it could have been , if we &apos;d been more empowered to take care of subtext .
and i mean something a little bit radical for a feminist , which is that i think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> in particular if there are people thinking groups .
for years , since i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve been interested in finding sexual difference .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world .
and what we know about <unk> studies is that women , on average , not all , but in <unk> , tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group .
and if we think about that , we have an interesting situation in our hands .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my consultants to know that i was interested in <unk> feminism considered me as a feminist , as a matter of <unk> , made me a little argument .
&quot; tell me what a woman named feminism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; that &apos;s the stupid question i heard .
feminism has to do with eliminating gender stereotypes , so there &apos;s nothing females in feminism . &quot;
but the more i &apos;ve thought about his question , the more i &apos;ve thought there is something females in feminism .
i mean , there could be something , on average , something else between the feminine and the male brain that makes us more attractive and willing to help the most vulnerable .
so even though the narratives were very much to find a way to protect people in the state , it &apos;s possible that , from having put more heads into this concept , maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the reciprocal support .
and maybe that &apos;s what we need to do in the future when we nurture democracy beyond the anatomy : think less in the individual body , in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
so , while we &apos;re trying to create a more perfect union , let &apos;s think about what we do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a storyteller , and this is my <unk> .
but before i show you what &apos;s inside , i &apos;m going to make a public confession , and that is , i &apos;m obsessed with suits .
i love finding , dress , and more recently , photograph and publishing in my blog , colorful and different fit for each time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
all my clothes are second @-@ hand in <unk> and second @-@ hand stores .
ah , thank you .
the second @-@ hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my wallet .
i get to meet homeless people ; normally my money goes to a good cause ; my looks unique , and buying turns into my personal search for <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my stature ?
would you like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are positive , then i feel i &apos;ve won .
back to the theme of my <unk> , i want to tell you what you &apos;re selling for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does anybody bring all that clothes into it ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
i brought seven pairs of underwear , and nothing else .
underwear for exactly one week is all i &apos;ve put in my rented .
i figured i &apos;d be able to find everything else i &apos;d like to use after i got here to palm springs .
and because they don &apos;t know me as the women who walk through ted in underwear , that means i found some things .
and i &apos;d like to show you now the clumps for this week .
doesn &apos;t it sound interesting ?
while i do , i &apos;m going to tell you a few of the lessons of life , believe it or not , i have learned in this adventure of not using new clothing .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money on looking good .
you can almost always see you phenomenal for less than 50 dollars .
the whole thing , including the one jacket , took me 55 , and it &apos;s the most expensive thing i &apos;ve ever used in the week .
monday : color is energy .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be from bad mood , when you &apos;re wearing a bright red .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to attract other people happy .
tuesday : integration is <unk> .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time wasted .
i just know you .
if you get rid of the right people , not only do you understand it , you will too .
wednesday : tell me about the child inside .
sometimes people say to me that they play <unk> , or i remember their little , seven year @-@ old .
i like <unk> and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : trust is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good at something , it &apos;s almost certain you are .
and if you think you don &apos;t see something good , you &apos;ll probably also be true .
my mother taught me this day after day .
but it wasn &apos;t until the 30 years i really understood its meaning .
and i &apos;ll explain it in a few seconds .
if you think you &apos;re a beautiful person in your inner and outside , there &apos;s no eyes you can &apos;t draw .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone in this audience .
we must be able to do everything we want to do .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth <unk> words for you : the gold <unk> go with everything .
and then finally , saturday : developing a self @-@ and @-@ one , it &apos;s a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
i have tried it over and over again , when people were approaching me this week , simply what i was using . and we had fantastic conversations .
obviously all of this won &apos;t go into my little <unk> .
so before i went home , to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to give you everything .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that you have to leave behind certain things .
i don &apos;t need to translate into emotionally into these things , because in the back of the corner , there will always be another bright , shiny suit , if there &apos;s a little love in my heart and i &apos;m looking .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good evening everybody .
i have something to show you .
think it &apos;s a flying <unk> , a flying <unk> .
in our laboratory , we call it sensitive design .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about this .
if you look at this picture -- i &apos;m an italian origin , all the kids in italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom , but the reason i show you this is that something very interesting has happened to the races of one in the last two decades .
some time ago , if you wanted to win a race in oneness , one took a budget and put it into a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the pilot were good enough , you would win the race .
but today , if you want to win a race , you need something like this -- something that <unk> your car in real time , with thousands of sensors that are picking information and transmitting it to the system , and then drive it and use it to give it to the car and change things in real time as you input information .
this is what , in engineering , is <unk> control system in real time .
it &apos;s essentially a system that has two components : a sensor and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is that real @-@ time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
our cities , over the last few years , have been covered with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re turning themselves into open air .
and , like , they &apos;re starting to respond differently and they can be squishy and <unk> .
cities are big .
as a separate note , i wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet , but they represent 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and up to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
if we could do something with cities , it would be a big thing .
beyond cities , all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects .
this is from an exhibition at <unk> <unk> by the end of the year at moma during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
well , our objects , our environment , begin to speak to us .
in a way , it &apos;s as though nearly all the atoms that have come up with these sensors and actuators .
and that &apos;s completely changing the interaction that we as humans have with the exterior environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo .
you know , when michelangelo creeps in , the moses says , in the end , he took the hammer , and he threw it down in moses -- you can see a little <unk> , and he says , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
well , today , for the first time , our environment starts to speak to us .
and i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples , insisting on the idea of gathering the environment and making something .
let &apos;s start with the detection .
the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab .
this was four and a half years ago in italy .
what we did there was we used a new kind of network of that moment that had been developed all over the world -- the nerdy phone network and the information that was somehow mediated by the operator to understand how the city behaves .
it was a summer hopefully 2006 .
it was the year in italy that he won the world cup .
maybe some of you remember , playing italy and france , and at the end of the world , he gave the <unk> .
and anyway , he eventually won italy .
now let &apos;s see what happened that day by looking at the tectonic activity in the network .
here we see the city .
you see the coliseum in the middle and the river <unk> .
it &apos;s morning , before play .
the time line is at the top .
late afternoon , there are people out here and there doing calls , moving .
the party starts : silence .
<unk> from france . <unk> in italy .
tt : people do a quick phone call and goes into the bathroom .
second time . end of the time wasted .
first extra time , second .
<unk> , and at a time , <unk> .
win , italy , yeah !
that night , everybody celebrated the center .
you see the big spike there .
the next day , they were all in the center of the winning team and the prime minister of that day .
and then the whole world went down .
you see the picture of the place called massimo circus where , from the roman period , people will celebrate , it &apos;s a great party , you can see the spike at the end of the day .
this is just an example of how you can measure the heart rate of the city in a way that we could not have done only a few years ago .
another quick example of detection : it &apos;s not about people , it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
today we know everything about the characteristics of our objects .
this is a map that shows all the chips that make up a mac , how they assemble .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we developed a few little tags to track the crap on its <unk> .
we started with a volunteers who helped us in seattle a little more than a year ago , to tag what they were throwing , different kinds of things , as you can see , things that were anyway .
then we put a little chip on them , a label on the trash and then started <unk> .
these are the results out there .
from seattle .
after a week .
with this information we realized that there are so many <unk> in the system .
we can do the same with much less energy .
these are data that didn &apos;t exist before .
they &apos;re happening complicated things , and there &apos;s a lot of unnecessary transportation .
but the other thing we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup we throw doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
that if the plastic bottle that we throw one day is still there .
that if we show that to people , then we can promote some behavior change .
that was the reason of the project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could tell us much more about detection and many other great things that we can do with that , but i wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning , which is to hit the environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk> .
it all began with a question of the mayor of the city , which came to us and told us that spain and south europe have a beautiful tradition of use of water in public spaces , in architecture .
and the question was , how can technology , the new technology , join us ?
and one of the ideas that we developed at mit , in a shop , was : imagine that they have a <unk> and valves , <unk> , <unk> that open and shut down .
it &apos;s created as a curtain of water , with <unk> of water .
if you land on them , you can write patterns , images , text .
and as you zoom in , the curtain will be open to get through , as you see in the image .
we introduced this to <unk> mayor .
he liked it very much .
and we commissioned a commission to design the building at the entrance to the <unk> .
we call it the digital water telescope .
the whole building is made of water .
there &apos;s no doors and no windows , but when you &apos;re approaching it so you can pass it on .
the roof is covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a little bit of wind , if you want to minimize the <unk> , the ceiling goes down .
or you can close the building and all architecture vanishes , like in this case .
those days will always be somebody , in the winter , when they go down the ceiling , somebody who was there and said , &quot; he <unk> the building . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not that they have <unk> it , but when it comes down almost all architecture goes away .
here it is working .
you see people being paralyzed by what &apos;s going on inside .
and here i am myself trying not to get wet by the sensors that open the water .
i think i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
that night was actually even more fun .
all kids in <unk> came to the building because the way they interacted had changed a little bit .
it was no longer a building that would open to let you pass , but it was a building that was continuing to slice and holes in water and one had to jump up and not .
and for us , it was very interesting because as architects , engineers , designers , we always think about the use that people will give our designs .
but then reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of making things to interact , that people use .
this is a picture of the building with the physical pixels , the water droplet , and of projection about them .
and this is what led us to think of the next project i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that those pixels could begin to fly .
imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and every one had a little <unk> that changes color as if it were a cloud that &apos;s moving in space .
this is the video .
imagine a helicopter , as we saw earlier , that moves with others in synchrony .
we could form this cloud .
a kind of a flexible screen like this with a regular two @-@ dimensional configuration .
or normal , but in three dimensions , what changes is light , not the position of the cores .
you can play it with a different type .
imagine that the screen appears at different scales and sizes , different types of resolution .
and that then all of that could be a <unk> cloud in 3d , where you can zoom in and go through , and see from many different angles .
this is the real controlled <unk> , going down to form a v , like before .
when the light goes on , you see this . the same thing we saw before .
imagine each one of them controlled by one person .
we can have every <unk> with an entry that comes from people , the movement of people , etc . , etc .
i want to show you something for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of today &apos;s best ballet dancers , the new york <unk> star and la <unk> <unk> to capture its movements in 3d and use them as inputs to the <unk> .
here we can see <unk> dancing .
on the left you see the <unk> , the capture in different <unk> .
it &apos;s so much 3d <unk> in real time as motion capture .
it can wash all the movement .
you can walk all the way around .
and once we have the rift , we can play with them , with color and movement , with gravity and rotation .
we want to use this as an entrance to the <unk> .
i wanted to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something for the london olympics .
it &apos;s called the cloud .
and the idea is , imagine again , that we could engage people in order to do something and change our arboreal environment as a <unk> like a barn raising , but with a cloud .
imagine we could make everybody react a little bit to a <unk> .
and i think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that , over the last two decades , we went from the physical world to the digital world .
we &apos;ve digitized everything , as knowledge , and is accessible across the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world , the self @-@ organized power of networks , the physical world .
in our case , you might want it to design it and make a symbol .
that would mean something built in a city .
but tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today : think of climate change or co2 emissions . how do we move from the digital world to the physical world ?
the idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made out of the same way the actual cloud is a cloud of particles .
and those particles are water , while in our cloud they are collapsing .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> .
you can move inside , have different experiences .
you can see from below , serve to share the main moments of the 2012 olympics and even further , and it can be used as a form of connection with the community .
so , it &apos;s both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can climb up , like a new summit of london .
you can go in there .
as if it were a new digital <unk> at night , but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody who goes to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the connection is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is connected .
i went for the first time to antarctica about 10 years ago , and i saw my first cries .
i was amazed .
my heart pounding , i was <unk> , trying to understand what was in front of me .
i <unk> them around the water almost 60 feet away , and i couldn &apos;t think of it as a snowflake as a snowflake as a snowflake as a snowflake as one year .
<unk> are born when you get rid of the glaciers or breaking the ice walls .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences .
some people refuse to give up and stand on till the end , while others can &apos;t get more and more fulfilled in a dramatic passion .
it &apos;s easy to think , looking at an iceberg , which are isolated and alone , largely as we see ourselves sometimes as humans .
but the reality is the opposite .
as an iceberg melts , i &apos;m breathing its ancient atmosphere .
as an iceberg melts , it releases rich water into minerals feeding lots of life .
i would photograph these <unk> as if it were about the portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these unique moments , there will be such a way and will never be there again .
it &apos;s not death when it &apos;s fearful ; it &apos;s not an end , but a course of its way through the life cycle .
part of the ice of <unk> , which is very young -- has a couple of thousands of years old .
and another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you are from an iceberg that i photographed in <unk> , greenland .
it &apos;s kind of often getting into a rolling iceberg .
here you go .
you can see on the left a little boat .
it &apos;s about five feet tall .
and i would like you to pay attention to the form of the iceberg and its <unk> line .
you can see here , it starts rolling , the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there .
this is a greenland iceberg , average size .
it stands for about 120 feet or 40 feet .
this video is in real time .
and so barroso , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
i &apos;ve clearly been <unk> in life with many amazing projects .
but the most great one i worked on was this guy .
the guy is called <unk> .
sharmeen was one of the most important instructors of the 1980s .
one day she came into her house after running and she said , &quot; dad , i feel a <unk> on my legs . &quot;
and that was the genesis of als .
today <unk> has a complete paralysis .
it can only use your eyes .
their work influenced me .
i have a design firm and animation company , obviously , graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world .
so we decided that we were going to ask the tony <unk> , and his cause .
so i went up and gathered with his brother and his father and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and he &apos;s able to communicate with me . &quot;
and i said , &quot; a second , it &apos;s not that you saw stephen <unk> , isn &apos;t all the people with paralysis can communicate through those devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re an important person and you have a very good insurance , you can &apos;t actually do it .
these devices are not affordable for people . &quot;
and i said , &quot; okay , how do you communicate then ? &quot;
anyone saw the movie &quot; the <unk> and the butterfly ? &quot;
they communicate in that way -- they <unk> it with their finger .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s wei . how can you be ? &quot;
so i ran across the only desire to give a check and instead of that , i wrote a check that didn &apos;t have the least idea of how i was going to cover it .
i subscribe to his brother and his father there on that precise moment , &quot; ok , this is the deal : tony &apos;s going to talk , we &apos;re going to build a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way to make his art again .
because it &apos;s ridiculous that somebody who has so much in their inner can &apos;t be cut . &quot;
so i talked at a conference a couple of months later .
i met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then , with a laser pointer , they draw about that and the negative space .
so they go there doing art installations like this .
all the things that come up , they say , are part of a life cycle .
first you start with the sex organs , then with the bad words , then with the bush and , finally , people start doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home , and as i was dealing with my wife , i would tell him about this , and we said , &quot; if we know that there &apos;s technology that allows me to use the eyes to control things for why we don &apos;t think a way we could control a laser to do graffiti again , it would be great . &quot;
and so the journey began .
and about two years later , about a year later , after an organization and a lot of ways to move things from side to side , we had achieved a couple of things .
one , we played the doors of insurance companies , and we got a machine so we could communicate , a machine like stephen hawking &apos;s machine .
which was great .
and , seriously , it &apos;s the most fun thing , i call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you say , &quot; i don &apos;t . this guy &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
the other thing we did was we brought seven programmers from around the world -- all the <unk> of all the world into our house .
my wife , kids and i , are moving back into the garage , and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> , and they took over the house .
many of our friends thought we &apos;d make something completely stupid and that when they were injured , they would have taken out the frames of the walls and instead there would be graffiti .
but for two weeks , we went to the <unk> ride , my son was part , my dog also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , snakes and you can see the description .
they &apos;re a pair of cheap sunglasses that we bought at <unk> beach &apos;s <unk> beach , some copper wire and stuff at 4 a.m.
we took a camera obscura , we opened it up on an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that &apos;s free and you build yourself , and we published the code under free .
and we created a device that has no limitation at all .
there &apos;s no insurance company saying &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital i can say , &quot; no . &quot;
anybody with paralysis today has access to draw and to communicate using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much . that was awesome .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
i love this picture because this is the other person &apos;s room , and that &apos;s her room .
there was this whole <unk> and <unk> during the great opening .
and then over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , high @-@ night sessions , tony was first drawing in seven years .
and this is a wonderful picture because this is the life support system , and it &apos;s looking through the life @-@ support system .
we rushed over to bed so i could see .
and we put a projector on a wall of the park outside of the hospital .
and he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the carport .
the funny thing was that we had to lay in the parking lot , so we feel like we were eating graffiti too .
at the end of this he gave us an e @-@ mail and this was what he said to us , &quot; this was the first time he was drawing in seven years .
i felt like i would have been under the water and someone finally come up and drag me out of there so i could breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
in a way , that &apos;s our scream at war .
that &apos;s what keeps us moving , developing .
and we have a long way to walk with this .
it &apos;s a great device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of a <unk> screen .
somebody with this artistic potential deserves far more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to make it faster and robust .
since then , we &apos;ve had all kinds of recognition .
we &apos;ve won many awards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making money with this .
everything comes out of our own pockets .
the awards went from the guy , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
armstrong described something about us and then , december , time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , and it was really great .
the best of all of this -- and this is what ends up closing -- is that in april of this year in l.a. &apos; 30s , there &apos;s going to be a show called &quot; art in the streets . &quot;
and &quot; art in the streets &quot; is going to have the best urban <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , all of them are going to be there .
sharmeen is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive .
so , basically this is my idea : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
none of what &apos;s in this room was capable of -- the computer , the microphone , the microphone , nothing was possible at some point .
make it possible -- anything in this room .
i &apos;m not a programmer , i never did anything with eye recognition , i just recognized something and told me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen .
and these are the questions i want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like we have to do . if it &apos;s not now , when ? and if i &apos;m not , who ?
thank you guys .
you know what i do is write for kids , and in fact , i &apos;m probably the author of children , more read in the united states .
and i always tell people i don &apos;t seem like a scientist .
i can claim it as a farmer , or with leather clothes , and no one has ever chosen a farmer .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and <unk> .
and you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell you somewhere .
you just have to go back to the apple to see it as an epiphany .
that &apos;s the painting of a cycle .
a friend of mine did that -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of tricky circle i &apos;ll talk about .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the middle school in <unk> , ohio where i was the weird kid .
when i was injured to bleed every week in the boys &apos; bathroom , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me walk into the teachers &apos; room .
he made it secret .
for three years .
and i had to leave the city .
i had a thumb , and 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- i found a lover -- and in the &apos; 80s , i felt the need to start working on organizations that were fighting aids .
about three or four years ago , on the night i got a phone call from that teacher , the bosnian lady said , &quot; i need to see you .
i &apos;m adults that we have never met .
you could call it ohio , and please bring that guy i know you &apos;ve already found .
and i have to tell you that i have pancreatic cancer , and i &apos;d like you to take care of it please . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we went to see , we laughed , we mourn , and we realized that she needed to be <unk> .
we found a place , we rented it , and we charge it for her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and as the woman who wanted to kill her as an adult came to <unk> her , she became a dead box of ash and she was thrown in my hands .
and what happened was that the cycle had closed , it had become a cycle -- and that epiphany that i talked about in itself .
epiphany is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , my partner and i saved her from her .
and you know that part of life needs everything the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m very happy that today talked a lot about this .
it also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our work to provide those things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion when you &apos;re 3,000 feet tall .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine an engine doing <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it sounds terrifying .
well , i had a one seat that day . i was sitting in the <unk> .
it was the only one i could talk to the flying <unk> .
so i immediately looked at them , and they said , &quot; there &apos;s no problem . you &apos;ll probably see some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already cracked the airplane , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot <unk> the plane with the hudson river .
usually that &apos;s not the road .
it will accelerate the motors .
imagine being on an airplane and without any noise .
and then he said three words -- the three more <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he said , &quot; <unk> for the impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more to the flying assistant .
i could see it in his eyes , it was terror . life was over .
i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
i learned that everything changes in a moment .
we have this list of things to do before we die , these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to get there and i didn &apos;t , all those fences that i wanted to repair , all the experiences i wanted to have and i never had .
as i was thinking about that later , i was a phrase , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;ll open it .
i don &apos;t want to depress you anything about life anymore .
and that urgency , that purpose , really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned that day -- and this is while i was filling up the bridge george washington , which was not very much -- i thought about , whoa , i really feel a big one , though .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
in my humanity and with my mistakes , i &apos;ve been trying to get better at everything i did .
but in my humanity , i also gave birth to my ego .
and i &apos;m sorry the time i spent on things that don &apos;t care about people who do care .
and i thought of my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
and then , as i looked at that , i witnessed the negative energy of my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
in two years , i haven &apos;t had a fight with my wife .
it feels like wonders .
i &apos;m no longer trying to be right ; i chose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is like your mental clock goes <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you see the water coming .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please fly . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this to break into 20 pieces like you can see in those documentaries .
and as i went , i had the feeling of , whoa , death doesn &apos;t fear .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been <unk> for all our life .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness is within one thought , which is , i just want one thing .
i wish i could see my kids growing up .
a month later , i was in an acting of my daughter -- first grade , not much artistic talent .
... still .
and i shout , yell , like a little one .
and for me , that was the whole reason of being in the world .
at that point , i understood by connecting those two points , that the only thing in my life is to be a great parent .
above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good parent .
i was given a miracle , not dying that day .
and i was given another gift , which was the possibility of looking into the future and going back and living differently .
you guys who are flying today , the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens to you on your airplane -- and please don &apos;t be that -- but imagine , how would it change ?
what would you do , which you still expect to do because you think you &apos;re going to live forever ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and most importantly , are the best parents who can be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the it worm is actually very simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the nuclear bomb .
their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the uranium plant in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see are real @-@ time control systems .
if we manage to compromise these systems that control speeds and valves , we can cause a lot of problems with <unk> .
the gray boxes don &apos;t use windows software ; they &apos;re from a completely different technology .
but if we can put a computer @-@ effective virus on a portable computer using an engineer to set up this gray box , then we &apos;re ready .
this is the plan behind <unk> .
we started with a windows <unk> .
<unk> enters the gray box , damages <unk> , and the iranian program is <unk> , <unk> quest .
it &apos;s easy , eh ?
i want to tell you how we discover this .
when we started investigating about <unk> six months ago , the purpose was completely unknown .
the only thing that was known is that it &apos;s very , very complex in the part of windows : the <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities of the day @-@ to @-@ zero .
it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these control systems .
that called us our attention , and we started an experiment where we filled our environment with <unk> , and we saw what was happening with this .
so they spent very strange things .
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat that didn &apos;t like our cheese : he tasted it , but he didn &apos;t want to eat .
i had no sense for me .
and then i had to experiment with different flavors of cheese , i realized , and i thought , &quot; this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s completely run . &quot;
the <unk> is seeking actively in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration , and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working in that place .
if not , <unk> does nothing .
so that called my attention , and we started working on it almost 24 hours a day , because i thought , &quot; we don &apos;t know what the goal is . &quot;
it could be , say , for example , a u.s. energy plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
better than a quick goal .
so we pulled up and gathered the code for attack , and we found that it was two digital bombs : a small one and a big one .
we also saw that they were armed very professionally by people who obviously had the whole information .
they knew all the points they attack .
you probably even know how much the operator would be .
so you know everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that <unk> is complex and high @-@ tech , let me tell you , the payload is very complex .
it &apos;s very much above all we &apos;ve seen before .
here you see a sample of this attack code .
we &apos;re talking about about about 10,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like the old dravidian language .
i want to tell you how we could find some sense of this code .
what we were looking at at at at the beginning was called the functions of the system , because we know what they do .
then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and trying to reconnect with the real world , with potential targets in the real world .
we need theories about what we can pass or <unk> .
to get to theories about goals , we remember that it &apos;s definitely a violent <unk> , it must be a valuable white one , and it &apos;s surely grounded in iran , because it &apos;s where most of the infections has been <unk> .
there are not many thousands of goals in that area .
basically you reduce the nuclear power plant of <unk> and <unk> plant of <unk> .
so i told my assistant , &quot; i &apos;ll sing a list of all the experts in palau and power plants among our clients . &quot;
i called them up and i told them in an effort to bridge their experience with what we find in code and data .
and it worked pretty well .
so we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of rotor .
spinning is that cellular part within the spin , that black object you see .
if you &apos;re running the speed of this cello , you can actually manufacture and even make it <unk> .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and flow in an obvious effort to go back to the nest maintenance engineers , so that they can &apos;t resolve this very quickly .
we &apos;re trying to crack the digital <unk> by looking very closely at the data and its structures .
so , for example , the number of apatzingán in that code , you can &apos;t catch it .
i started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are constructed in <unk> , and i found that they are <unk> in what &apos;s called a icefall , and every waterfall is <unk> .
that made sense , there was a coincidence .
and he got better yet .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 stages .
and guess what do we find in the code of attack ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a good coincidence .
this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between our hands .
so there was no <unk> : it wasn &apos;t .
the results have been collected after several weeks of hard work .
we would routinely swim in without any ends , and we had to start again .
yet , we found that both digital <unk> will surpass one single and the same goal , but from different angles .
the small <unk> is drinking down , and spinning the <unk> and <unk> , and the big <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating valves .
in the sum , we are very confident that we have determined what the recipient is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
we shouldn &apos;t worry about other goals being <unk> by others .
i &apos;ll show you a few very interesting things that we saw , i &apos;d actually take care of .
there &apos;s the gray box , and you see the <unk> .
what this thing does is it dilates the input values of sensors , for example , of pressure sensors and vibration sensors and provides legitimate code , which is still running during the attack , with false input data .
and believe it or not , these fake <unk> data is bought by <unk> .
it &apos;s like in hollywood movies where , during <unk> , the security chamber feeds on <unk> video .
it &apos;s great , eh ?
the idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the room of control .
it &apos;s actually much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to <unk> a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human operator could not perform fast .
for example , in an energy plant , when the grand steam engine occurs at a rate , you have to open an exit shell for a millisecond .
obviously , this cannot make a human operator .
that &apos;s where we need digital security systems .
and when they &apos;re engaged , then they can pass bad things .
the plant can explode .
and you wouldn &apos;t even <unk> the safety system you &apos;ll notice .
that scares him .
but it can be worse .
what i &apos;m going to say is very important .
think about this . this generic attack is generic .
it has nothing to do with , specifically , with uranium <unk> .
it could also work , for example , in a power plant , or a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to disseminate this charge with a usb key , as we saw in the case of <unk> .
you could also use conventional worm <unk> technology .
we &apos;ll make the most possible .
and if you translate that , what you do is with a <unk> of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to confront .
unfortunately , the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states and japan .
all the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals .
we must face the consequences , and we better start preparing us now .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s taken public on many sides that people assume that edmontosaurus is the main entity behind this .
what is your opinion ?
ralph <unk> : okay , do you really want to hear this ?
yeah . ok .
my view is that the <unk> is involved , but the engine is not israel .
the engine behind this is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s one , and that &apos;s the united states , fortunately , .
because otherwise , our problems would be even older .
thank you for <unk> . thank you , ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years focusing on situations usually very difficult and at the same time a very dangerous time .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
it was filmed in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days only eating this -- fun at the beginning , which is difficult in the middle , very dangerous to the end .
in fact , in many parts of my career , i &apos;ve been <unk> in situations in awful appearance , with the only goal of looking at social issues in ways that are appealing , interesting things , and hopefully , by measuring them in a way that you &apos;ll see and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew that here to make a tedtalk on the world of brands and <unk> , i wanted to do something a little different .
so , some of you may have heard of it , or not a couple of weeks ago , i took an ad on ebay .
i sent some messages on facebook , some on twitter , selling the rights of my tedtalk by 2011 .
so , a lucky one , a corporation , a nonprofit , was going to have the unique opportunity in the arboreal life that chris anderson won &apos;t allow himself to buy the rights of the talk that they &apos;re seeing right now that there was no title and it didn &apos;t really recognize what it would be .
what he had was the following : &quot; here <unk> name shows : my tedtalk that they have no idea what it is and the content could be buried in the face , especially if i put it in ridicule you or your company to do it .
but by saying this , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
it &apos;s a title of progress , by the way .
so even with that inoculation , i knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name .
if i had asked him a year ago , i could not have been able to make sure .
but in the new film i &apos;m working on , we examined the world of marketing , of advertising .
and as i mentioned earlier , i &apos;ve been in horrible situations in the last few years , but nothing could make me , nothing could <unk> me , for something as difficult or as dangerous as i could walk into the halls with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
i want to make a film that tries to deal with the product <unk> and marketing and advertising , and that the whole film was associated with product <unk> , marketing and advertising .
the film will be called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
what happens in &quot; the top film &quot; is that everything from the bottom up , from beginning to end , has <unk> images , all the time -- from the <unk> that appears before the title , the x @-@ ray .
now this brand , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center .
these people were shrinking into the film at <unk> -- forever .
and so the film looks at all this idea . is it what ? a <unk> , forever ?
i &apos;m a storyteller .
it was more motivational .
it was &quot; a <unk> . forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the x @-@ files , but we &apos;re going to make sure about all the categories we can in the film .
maybe you &apos;ll get a shoe and you get the coolest shoe you used ...
the most great car you &apos;ve ever offered in &quot; the bigger film , &quot; the best drink you &apos;ve ever drunk , from &quot; the larger film you &apos;ve ever appealed . &quot;
the idea is then also to show the brands as part of the life , to make them film graspable .
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole process in this movie .
that &apos;s the whole idea , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love you to help make it happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny because it &apos;s the first time i hear that ; it &apos;s the maximum respect for the audience .
however , i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t know if &quot; an angle is too <unk> , but you know how it &apos;s going to be ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
a million and a half .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to engage with them , but it &apos;s definitely going to be worthwhile to convince a couple of big brands .
who knows , maybe for the time the movie comes out , let &apos;s see us as a whole bunch of <unk> .
what do you think is going to be the answer ?
most of the answers will be &quot; no . &quot;
but will it be hard to sell , by the film or for me ?
jk : both .
it means you are not very optimistic .
so do you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
all right .
awesome .
we have to think about what brands .
yeah .
when you look at the people you have to deal with ...
we have some places where to go .
it turns out the camera .
i thought , &quot; <unk> the camera &quot; meant we have a conversation outside of our mic .
the camera says , &quot; we don &apos;t want to know anything about your movie . &quot;
and so it was , one by one , all these companies suddenly disappeared .
no one wanted to have anything to do with this movie .
i was shocked .
they didn &apos;t want to know anything with this project .
and i was very impressed , i thought the concept of advertising , was to introduce the product to as many people as possible , to tell them that as many people watched it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this intersection of new media and old media and media and the media landscape , is it not the idea that you have with that new vehicle worthy of attention that goes to the masses ?
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had a bug error , and that error was this .
in fact , there was no such mistake .
there was no bug at all .
this would have been right .
but the problem was what this image represents .
see , when you search for images of transparency in google , it appears -- this is one of the first images that appear .
i like your way to roll , sergey brin . no .
this was the problem : transparency -- open @-@ up or deception , easily seen , easily understandable , which is characterized by data or access , especially in business practices -- being the last line , maybe the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency in these days .
our politicians name , the name of the name , the president , even the ceo named .
but all of a sudden when it comes to making a reality changes .
but why ? well , transparency is afraid -- like that weird bear that continues to be .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this weird road .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s very risky .
when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story and they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell you a story .
we want us to make a story , but we want us to save our story . &quot;
see , when i was a child and my father <unk> me at lie and there he is staring at me as he used to say , &quot; son , there are three sides in every story .
it &apos;s your story , it &apos;s my story , and it &apos;s the real story . &quot;
as you can see , in this film , we wanted to tell the actual story .
but with only one company , one agency wants to help me -- and that &apos;s only because i knew john bond and richard <unk> -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i would have to cut out the middle @-@ class and go to the companies myself with my whole team .
so what i started to realize suddenly -- and what i started giving <unk> is that when you start talking to companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends making large films , huge , giant films and others making small , independent films like mine .
and my friends who make large hollywood movies , giant hollywood , say the reason their movies are so successful is because of the associated brands that they have .
and then my friends making independent movies say , &quot; okay , how we &apos;re supposed to compete with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
how are we going to see specifically to ban him in the movie ?
every time i &apos;m out there , every time i open my <unk> , you &apos;ll see the ban ban .
at any point during an interview with someone i can say , &quot; are you ok for this interview ?
are you ready ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you .
maybe you should put a little bit of it before the interview . &quot;
and there was one of these fabulous <unk> .
so much &quot; floral <unk> &quot; as &quot; <unk> of paradise is going to have its opportunity .
we &apos;re going to have as much for men as a solid woman , to <unk> , on ticker , on ticker , to be .
that &apos;s the general look .
now i can answer your questions and give you a quick overview .
we &apos;re a little brand .
similar to the kind of smaller movies we predicted ; we &apos;re more like a rival brand .
so we don &apos;t have the budgets that have other brands .
so , to do things like this , you know , to remind people of it is the reason that we care about it .
what words would they use to describe to ban ban ban ban on ban on theaters ?
ban is on the target .
that &apos;s a big question .
top technology : top technology .
technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put into the <unk> .
we talk about something bold , fresh .
i think that &quot; cool &quot; is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus &quot; the odor and the <unk> . &quot;
it keeps you cool .
how do we keep you cooler ? with you better , more freshness , three times cooler .
things like those that spawned benefits .
and that &apos;s a multi @-@ billion @-@ dollar company .
what about me ? what about a common type ?
i need to talk to the guy on the street , the people like me , the common <unk> .
they have to talk to me about my brand .
how do you define your brand ?
mm : my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like the good clothes .
baby : get it back 80 , punk <unk> unless it &apos;s day too late .
okay , what is the <unk> brand ?
something unique .
i guess the type of gender , the style i have would be like a dark @-@ tech .
i like the dark colors , many gray and things like that .
i usually wear <unk> like sunglasses , or i like crystals and <unk> .
if dan was a brand , he could be a classic <unk> , rughal .
the brand i am , i would call it a random flight .
two : in part of a hippie , in part of <unk> , part of the girl brooklyn , i don &apos;t know .
man # 3 : i &apos;m the type of pets .
i sell pet toys in the country and the world .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my small sector , that &apos;s my brand .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because we &apos;re <unk> .
man 5 : brand @-@ <unk> writer .
is that something ?
lawyer : i am a lawyer .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be tom , but i often get into the intersection of dark glamour and <unk> .
i realized i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could come into my head , somebody who could help me understand what they call the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and i found a company called <unk> in pittsburgh .
they helped him companies like navigenics , <unk> , meet that personality .
if they could do it for them , they could surely do it for me .
let &apos;s take the pictures , right ?
yeah . the first picture is a family photo .
tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to being .
these people shape my way to see the world .
tell me about that world .
that world ? i think your world is the world you live in -- like people around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the work you do .
all of those things come up and start in a place and in my case they fall open and start in my family , in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next one is the best day in my life .
how does this relate to your thoughts , feelings and how you are ?
it &apos;s like who would like to be me .
i like different things .
i like weird things . i like things .
tell me about &quot; why ... &quot; what does that serve us ?
what is the <unk> ? what do you find now ?
why is it important to reconcile ? what &apos;s red ?
tell me a little bit about that .
a little more than you , which is not who you are .
what other guesses have you had ?
i don &apos;t have to fear . what kind of rollercoaster you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of this .
there was a lot of crazy about this .
the first thing i saw was this idea that there are two different sides , but worldwide , in your brand @-@ new , morgan <unk> , it &apos;s a players who are a very serious one .
they dressed very well together .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox in them .
and i think some companies only focus on one of their strong points or another rather than focusing on both .
many companies tend to -- and it &apos;s the nature -- to avoid things that are not secure ; they prevent fear , those elements , and you actually give them to sink and make something positive for you , and it &apos;s nice to see that .
what other brands are like this ?
the first one here is the classic , apple .
and you can also see here at <unk> , wii mini , <unk> and <unk> .
now there are <unk> and conscious brands , those things that have come and come , but a playful @-@ conscious brand is quite powerful .
a playful @-@ conscious brand . what is your brand ?
if somebody asked you to engage your brand identity , your brand personality , what would you be ?
are you a bottom @-@ up ? are you somebody who drives the blood ?
or are you rather a lower attribute ?
a little cooler , special , conservative ?
the further attributes are like playful being <unk> like prince , contemporary , <unk> , fearless or bold as <unk> , rapid or <unk> , dominant , magical or mystic .
or are you better at the top @-@ down ?
are you conscious , sophisticated as <unk> ?
are you set up , traditional provider , protective ? you name it with oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , familiar , confident , holy , <unk> or wise , like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of this movie , we had over 500 companies , climbing and <unk> , who said , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want to form part of this project .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film , mainly because they wouldn &apos;t have control , they wouldn &apos;t have control over the end product .
but we did 17 brand @-@ new partner partner partner @-@ giving partner @-@ giving partner who wanted to be in the business with someone who was conscious and playful like me and who , in the end , had empowered us to tell stories that we would usually not have been able to tell -- stories after a <unk> would usually never go .
we were allowed to tell the story of the visually , and we were able to tell the story in this movie of how they now use mri to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing and film .
we went to sao paulo where the advertising is forbidden open air .
in the entire city over the last five years , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no <unk> , there &apos;s nothing .
and we went to school districts where businesses are on their way into schools with humanitarian problems in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i &apos;ve had the biggest answer or the biggest response i &apos;ve ever had in most successful are those in which i &apos;ve ever dealt with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
they took their <unk> , took their agencies , and they said maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to try directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to make people think about , that &apos;s going to defy the way we look at the world .
and how have you been ? are you succeeding ?
well , ever since the movie was released in the <unk> festival , let &apos;s take a look .
according to <unk> the film was released in january , and since then -- and this is not <unk> , we &apos;ve had 900 million impressions in the media for this film .
this only takes a two @-@ week and @-@ a @-@ half period .
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no tv .
the film is not yet forbidden .
it &apos;s not yet online . it &apos;s not in <unk> .
you haven &apos;t even presented in other countries yet .
ultimately , this film has begun to gain momentum .
and it &apos;s not bad because virtually every agencies we talk to their subscribers on their subscribers not being part .
i &apos;ve always believed that if you risk , if you take risks , that in those risks , there are opportunities .
i think when you take people out of that , you &apos;re pushing them into failure .
i think when you &apos;re training your employees at risk aversion , it &apos;s preparing their whole company to reward them for rewards .
i feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to take advantage .
we have to encourage people who don &apos;t have a fear of the opportunities that can be provided .
ultimately , let &apos;s move forward , i think we have to give it to fear .
we have to put that bear in a cage .
we criticized fear . we attribute risk .
from a <unk> at a time , we have to embrace risk .
and in the end , we have to get the transparency .
today more than ever a little bit of honesty goes a long way .
and by saying this , with honesty and transparency , all my talk has been &quot; <unk> , &quot; which has been introduced by my good friends at <unk> who for $ 1 had the name on ebay .
turning big data into big opportunities for companies around the world .
sharmeen presents himself with &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
thank you very much people .
so , morgan , at the name of transparency , exactly what happened with those $ 1.25 growing ?
it &apos;s a fantastic question .
in my pocket , i have a check to name the ted matrix , the sapling foundation , which is a check for dollars to be applied to my assistance for ted next year .
my name is <unk> .
and i did 18 months ago , another job in google , until i launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss who &apos;s here and allowed me to do it .
it took me 18 months and it took me 18 months .
many negotiations and stories , i promise you , with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did it .
i think my own story just explains this slide , and this is the access .
i grew up in india .
joy of a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- but i didn &apos;t have access to many of these museums and works of art .
so when i started traveling and going to museums , i began learning a lot .
and working on google , i &apos;m trying to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing it .
better than the demo i &apos;ll show you a couple of interesting things that we &apos;ve done from his launch .
so , simply : we &apos;re going to steal .
look around all the museums there .
there &apos;s the <unk> gallery , moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
in fact , i &apos;m going to go into one of my favorites , into <unk> , the new york art museum .
there are two ways of doing that -- very simple .
we click , we click ! we &apos;re in the museum anymore .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are , mumbai or <unk> , that doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around and you have fun .
do you want to browse through the museum ?
we opened the upper plane , and with one click , we jump in .
they &apos;re inside , you want to go to the end of the hall .
keep moving forward . what a <unk> !
explore .
thank you , but i haven &apos;t reached the best .
now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; by pieter <unk> .
i see the biologically sign .
if the museum shows us the image , we click there .
look , this is one of the images .
here &apos;s all the metadata data .
for those of you who are really interested in art , you can click there , but i &apos;m going to click right now .
and this is one of the images that we &apos;ve captured in what we call <unk> technology .
so this image , for example , contains , i think , about 10,000 million hits .
and there are many people who ask me , &quot; what do you get with 10,000 million hits ? &quot;
so i &apos;ll show you what you actually get with 10,000 million hits .
it can zoom in around in a very simple way .
you see fun things that are happening .
i love this kid , his expression has no price .
but if you really did go into it .
so i started playing , and i found something that was happening there .
and i said , &quot; a moment , this looks interesting . &quot;
i went in and discovered that kids were actually playing something .
i did a little , i talked to some people from the <unk> , and i actually discovered that this is a game called &#91; unclear &#93; , which is about hitting a stick with a pole on the beach .
and apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
and now we &apos;re going to get even further into depth and you &apos;ll see that you can even get to the cracks .
now just to give you a little bit of perspective , i &apos;m going to take the picture , so you &apos;ll actually see what there is .
this is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best one is coming , a second .
so now we &apos;re going to quickly jump again to moma in new york .
here &apos;s another one of my favorites , &quot; night <unk> . &quot;
the example i showed was to find detail .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
and what if you want to see how van actually created this masterpiece ?
it increases and actually what it does .
i &apos;m going to one of my favorite parts in this picture , and i &apos;m actually going to get to the cracks .
this is &quot; <unk> night , &quot; i think i &apos;d never seen it this before .
i &apos;m going to show you one of my favorite features .
there &apos;s a lot more stuff here , but i don &apos;t have time to go .
this is the really cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
all of you , absolutely everybody , doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re rich or poor , or whether you have a cooker , that &apos;s the same thing .
you can online create your own museum , create your own collection from all these images .
it &apos;s very simple , we came in -- i &apos;ve created this function that i call &quot; the power of zoom in , &quot; -- we just made a zoom in .
this is &quot; the ambassadors in the national gallery in london .
you can write things , you can tell your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you consider these masterpieces .
so in conclusion , i think , the main thing is that all incredible things don &apos;t really come from google .
no , in my opinion , they even come from museums .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say this .
in fact , they come from those artists .
and that has been my humble experience with this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium makes justice to its work of art and being properly mastered .
and the big question they asked me today is , &quot; are you doing this to see the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it &apos;s to supplement the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a depiction of your brain that we can divide into two parts .
the left side , which is the rationale , and the right side , which is the intuitive part .
so if we measured a scale to measure the competence of every hemisphere , we could design a blueprint of our brain .
for example , this would be someone who is completely logical .
this would be somebody who is completely intuitive .
so where do you get your brain on this scale ?
some <unk> on one of these extreme ends , but i think for most of the members of this audience , your brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not that they are mutually <unk> .
you can be logical and intuitive .
i consider myself one of those people , and the same as most other experimental physicists , we need quite a bit of rationale for <unk> these intricate ideas .
but at the same time , we need fairly intuition to make experiments really work .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we like to play with things .
we play with them and then we see how they react , and then we develop our intuition from that point .
and actually , you do the same thing .
some intuition that you might have developed over the years is what it says that one thing can only be in a place at a time .
i mean , it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
i remember watching a child playing in a parking lot .
he was a little kid , and he wouldn &apos;t do it very well , he always fell .
but i bet the playing with that <unk> bar taught him a worthy lesson , and that is that big things don &apos;t allow them to fill them in , and they stay in a place .
this is a big conceptual model that you can have from the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> bars , they play with these little particles .
and when they play with their particles , they discover that they do all sorts of weird things -- like they can go through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and then they wrote all these observations , and they called it quantum mechanics .
at that point , the physics was found a few years ago ; you had the quantum mechanics to describe these little particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the big objects around us everyday .
that &apos;s not very well due to my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s because i don &apos;t play very often with particles .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not much .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody saw a particle .
but i &apos;m also not getting into my logical part .
because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t find the reason i shouldn &apos;t .
and so i would feel much better if i could somehow show that a common object also remains the principles of quantum mechanics .
that &apos;s why a few years ago , i asked myself to do exactly that .
and i did .
this is the first object you can see that has been in a picture of quantum mechanics .
what we see here is a little computer chip .
and you can try to see the green dot right in the middle .
that &apos;s the little metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
this is a picture of the object .
and here i &apos;m going to expand a little bit . it &apos;s right in the middle .
and then here we do a big approach to the little metal <unk> .
what we see is a little bit of metal , with a trampoline , and then supported on a platform .
and then i did this almost the same way you would do a computer chip .
i went into a clean room with a silicon chip , and i started running all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last material , i had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the form of the swimming underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap , but it needs a little help .
let me make an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people .
i mean , when i &apos;m in an elevator only , i do all kinds of weird things , but then when other people get up , i &apos;ll stop doing those things , because i don &apos;t want to annoy them , or actually scares them .
quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way .
the <unk> of the inanimate objects are not only people , it &apos;s also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on its side and the heat of the room .
so we knew that if we wanted this little metal to behave according to quantum mechanics , we would have to withdraw all the other passengers .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we drilled through the lights , then we introduced a vacuum and pulled all the air out , and then we cool it down into less than a degree above zero .
now , by being alone in the elevator , the little bit of metal is free to act as you want .
so we measured its movements .
we found it moving into very strange forms .
instead of staying still , i was vibrating , and the way i witnessed it was like a breath like a <unk> that stretches out and contract .
and by giving him a gentle push , we were able to make it work and not at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is really fantastic .
what does it mean that a <unk> thing and don &apos;t just run at the same time ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
in one case : all the trillions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
it &apos;s only in certain <unk> when those string up .
in the rest of the time , they are <unk> .
it means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which at once means that all the metal is in two different places .
i think this is great .
true .
it was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years , because , look at this , the difference on scale between one atom and that little metal is about the same as the difference between that little metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , and that metal piece can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you too ?
i mean , it &apos;s my logical part that he talks .
so imagine if you were in various places at the same time , how would that be ?
how would you affect your consciousness if your body was embedded in space ?
there &apos;s another part of the story .
and it &apos;s when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and we looked inside the box , we saw that the metal was still there in one piece .
and i could get to this new intuition , apparently all the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected .
well , that &apos;s not so true .
it &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they have the chance to choose amongst at least a handful of different cities that are competing to bring new residents .
well , right now , we &apos;re far away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have a single city willing to support them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are much more than their cost of building .
so we could easily degrade the tens of new cities .
well , this may sound absurd if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but let &apos;s just run through apartment buildings .
imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in apartments are already owned , and the next half of them still regretted it .
you could try to increase the capacity by making all the buildings available .
but you know that the problem that you see is that those buildings and the areas surrounding them have rules to avoid the discomfort and the distractions of the building .
so it would be very difficult to do all those <unk> .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new building , always and when the rules of that place were opening up rather than putting it down .
so i proposed that governments would gather new area of reform to hold cities and give them a name : charter cities .
i later found out that more or less at the same time , <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of honduras reform .
they knew that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in honduras .
and at a time , <unk> told us to take care of him : &quot; what would happen if land insisted , and we just gave them a <unk> , a little bit of the u.s. embassy , another one of the <unk> , and so if people want to go to work under the rules of canada or the united states , they can go to this work .
in the summer of 2009 , he went through a mediterranean crisis .
in the next regular election , <unk> <unk> <unk> has been put on a platform where we prescribe reforms and at the same time reconciliation .
he was asked to let him meet his boss chief .
meanwhile , i was preparing to give a talk at tedglobal .
through a process of <unk> , trial and error and a lot of testing with users , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their most essential ideas .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t go and annoy at all the skyline of apartments .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but you need both technologies and rules to make progress , and usually they are the rules that are keeping us away .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent him into a link with the tedtalk .
he showed him at <unk> .
they called me .
they said , &quot; we will hire this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so in december , we sat in miami , in a conference room at a hotel .
i tried to tell you this point about how the cities are , far more valuable than their monetary cost .
and i used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like new york , notice , land that , in some cases , are worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a rather abstract discussion , and at some point , when there was a pause , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk . &quot;
and the talk described in very simple terms that a city under a charter is a place where you start with <unk> territory , a charter that specifies the rules that are there and a choice so people can pick up whether they want to go or not live under those rules .
so the president of honduras called me , and he told me that we had to do this project , this is important , this could be the way for our country to advance .
he asked me to go out and talk again on the fourth and january 5 .
so i presented another talk full of data , which included an image like this , which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city , this one has to be very large .
this is a photo of denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in denver .
only this airport is covering over 100 square miles .
so i was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city , you have to start with a site that would weigh at least one thousand square miles .
that &apos;s over 100,000 hectares .
the whole world <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and open @-@ minded .
the leader of congress approached the platform and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you so much for his talk , but maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk .
i have it here on my computer . &quot;
so i sat down and they showed the tedtalk .
and this explained the essential , that a new city can offer new choices for people .
there would be an option in a city where you could go that could be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away from the north .
and they also monitored new choices for leaders .
because the leaders of honduras government would need help from partner countries , could benefit from the partners that led them to establish and fulfill the charter standards , so that everybody could trust the charter charter charter .
and what the yahoo president thought of it was that that a guarantee that i was considering as a way to attract the foreign investors so that they would occupy the city could be equally important for all the parties in honduras that they &apos;d had suffered in so many years because of fear and mistrust .
we went and saw a site .
this picture is from there .
it could easily be about a thousand square miles .
and soon after , on january 19th , they voted in congress to further their constitution , and add a <unk> that allowed us to create these special regions of development .
in a country that had just passed through this painful crisis , the voting in congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was <unk> by one .
all parties , all the factions in society , the <unk> .
to get you into the constitution , you have to pass two times into congress .
on the 17th of february , the ballot was approved again on one another election , from <unk> to one .
immediately after the election , of the 21st @-@ to @-@ talk , a delegation of about 30 <unk> was two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities .
one of them is south korea .
this is a picture of a new center of the city that is being constructed in south korea ; it &apos;s bigger than the center of boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after it spent four years getting permission .
the other interested country in building cities is singapore .
in fact , they &apos;ve already built two cities in china and are preparing for a third .
and if you think about this in a practical way , this is where we are .
they have a site , and they &apos;re already thinking about a place for the second city .
they &apos;re setting up a legal system that would enable the managers to come and operate under an external legal system .
a country has already committed to allowing its supreme court to be the ultimate court for this new judicial system .
there are <unk> and cities that are very interested in the project .
they can even get some funding .
but the only thing we know that they &apos;ve already cracked is that they have a good number of people .
there &apos;s a lot of companies that wanted to lie in the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s a lot of people who would like to go there .
in the world , there are 700 million people who say they would immediately be changed to another location .
there &apos;s a million a year that comes out of latin america to go to the united states .
many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to get a job ; sometimes they are single mothers who have to earn the money to just eat or buy clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents who have not seen , in some cases , in a decade .
so what do you think of building a new city in honduras ?
or building a dozen of these , or a hundred of these all over the world ?
what do you seem to think about fitting in so that families can pick up various cities that are racing to bring to new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends urged me to say , &quot; thank you ted . &quot;
do you know how many decisions we make one day ?
do you know how much we choose in a week ?
i recently made a survey to over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says to pick an american average , are about 70 per day .
not too long ago , in research , followed by a week to a group of game presidents .
the researchers recorded the different tasks <unk> by these ceos and the time they spent on making decisions related to those tasks .
they found that , on average , they paid jobs a week .
of course , each work included many <unk> .
half those decisions took nine minutes or so .
only 12 percent will an hour or more of your time .
now think about your choices .
do you know how many belong to the age of nine , and how many of an hour ?
how do you evaluate the way those decisions drive ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest problems i want to choose from the sugar rush .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
while i talk about this , i &apos;m going to ask you a few questions and i need to know your answers .
when i ask a question , as i &apos;m blind , raise your hand only if you want to burn calories .
otherwise , when you ask a question , if your answer is positive , please have a <unk> .
and now my first question of day : are you ready to hear about the problem of the menu of choices ?
thank you .
being a graduate student at stanford university , we rented this very , very high @-@ level grocery store , at least in that time , it was very sophisticated .
it was called <unk> .
it was almost like going into an amusement park .
there were about 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar , over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 of bottled water , and this was when we were taking water off the board .
i loved going into that store , but one time i wondered , why don &apos;t i buy anything ?
this is the amoeba oil shelf .
they had over 75 different classes , including the ones that were in circular box that came out of <unk> trees .
i once decided to go to the manager and say , &quot; is this strategy of offer all these choices ? &quot;
he told me the buses full of tourists every day , usually with his cameras .
we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> . this is the amoeba .
they had qualitatively different lessons .
we installed a seat for <unk> , right at the entrance to the store .
we put there six tastes in it , or 24 different flavors , and we looked at two things : first , what case people were willing to stop the <unk> ?
more people stopped when they were 24 ; 60 percent , than when there were only six , 40 percent .
we also looked at what case they were most susceptible to buying a <unk> .
here we find the opposite effect .
of the ones who stopped when i was 24 , only three percent of the people stopped buying <unk> .
when i was six , we saw that 30 percent bought <unk> .
if we do the calculations , people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found 24 .
well , to decide that we don &apos;t buy <unk> , we &apos;re probably much less good at conserving <unk> , but it turns out that the problem of choosing is affecting us in a good way .
we decided not to decide , even when this doesn &apos;t hurt us .
now the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe to you a study that i did with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , where we see the decisions about savings in terms of about a million americans , about a six @-@ million plans in this country .
we were interested to see whether the number of money offers available in a state @-@ savings plans , the <unk> program , <unk> people to save for the future .
and we found that actually there was a correlation .
we had two plans that went from two to 59 different options .
we found that the older the number of public funding , there was less participation .
so , if we look at the fringes , we see that in the plans they offer two funds , the participation rate was 70 or more , not as high as you would .
and on the plans that about 60 funds , the participation rate went down to 60 .
it turns out that even if you choose to participate , when there &apos;s more choices , even in that case , there &apos;s negative consequences .
so , for those who decided to participate , the older the number of choices , the more people benefited from avoiding the actions or the investment funds .
as soon as there were more options , they were more willing to invest in the financial account of the market .
but none of these extreme decisions are the ones that to optimize the future well @-@ being .
in the last decade we &apos;ve seen three key consequences by providing more and more possibilities .
the most likely thing is to make a decision , that i &apos;ll stick it even when this goes against self @-@ interest .
they are more likely to make the worst decisions ; in finance and health .
they &apos;re more prone to picking things less satisfying , even though objectively they &apos;re doing better .
the main reason is that we &apos;re looking at this array of <unk> , mustard , vinegar , and <unk> , but we &apos;re not able to do the calculations to compare , contrast and choose that awesome show .
today i want to use four simple techniques that we &apos;ve treated , in one form or another , in different research , so that you can test them in your business .
the first one is , cut .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it has never been more true than today , less is more .
people always get upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they worry about losing space in hinduism .
but actually what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut , get rid of odd options , there will be a increase in sales , there will be a better experience in the election .
when we exhale &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; poor to 15 , saw 10 percent increase in sales .
when the <unk> <unk> <unk> group were removed by the <unk> of cats that were less selling , up to 87 percent , by two causes : higher sales and lower costs .
you know that the supermarkets today , on average offer you about 45 products .
in a walmart store you have about 100,000 products .
but the ninth largest store in today is only <unk> and offers only 1,400 products -- a type of tomato sauce .
in the world of financial savings , i think one of the best examples that have sprung up on how to handle the best choices is david <unk> &apos;s poetic , the harvard program .
all the harvard employees are automatically embedded in a living fund .
the people who really want to choose , they offer 20 funding , not 300 or more .
you know that people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
they &apos;re all important options . &quot;
the first thing i do is i ask the clerks : &quot; tell me the difference between those choices .
and if their employees can &apos;t tell the difference , they can &apos;t make their customers . &quot;
this evening , before i started this session , i was talking to gary .
he told me that i would be willing to offer people in this audience a vacation with all paid to the most beautiful highway in the world .
here , a description .
i want you to read it .
i &apos;m going to leave a few seconds to read it , and then i want you to give it a applause if you &apos;re ready to take the offer of gary .
ok . anybody who &apos;s ready to accept the offer .
right ?
well , i &apos;m going to show you something else .
you knew there was a trick .
who is ready for that journey ?
i think i actually heard more hands .
all right .
in fact , you had more information in the first round , than in the second round , but i can tell you that you thought the second time was more real .
because the images made it more real .
this leads me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> , which is afrigadget .
for people to understand the differences between choice , they have to understand the consequences of every option , and that the consequences must feel very vivid , concrete .
why do people spend 15 percent on average when they use card or credit cards , which when they use cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t look real money .
it turns out that making people look more real , they can be a very positive tool for people to perceive more .
we did a study with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which was working on <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were attached to a utilitarian plan .
at that meeting , we had exactly exactly as it was used , we made a little addition .
what we added was that we filed the staff to think about the positive things that were rooted in their lives if we paid more money .
with this <unk> , there was a spike in 20 percent and an increase in how much they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings accounts , four percent .
the third technique is to classify .
we can handle more categories than options .
for example , this is a study that we did in a magazine hall .
we saw that in the <unk> @-@ <unk> supermarkets across the northeast <unk> , the <unk> show can be carried from <unk> different types to <unk> .
but , you know ?
if i show you 600 magazines and i do 10 categories , and i compare it to 400 <unk> in 20 groups , you &apos;ll think i &apos;ve offered you more choices and a better experience of whether i &apos;m offering those 400 , which if i put 600 .
because classification tells me how to fix it .
these are two cotton exhibitions .
one is called &quot; <unk> &quot; and the other , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think the one on the left is shaking and the one on the right is <unk> , give a <unk> .
well , there are some .
if you think the one on the left is shaking and the one on the right is <unk> , give a <unk> .
well , something else .
it turns out it &apos;s right .
the one on the left is incidental and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know something ?
this rating is completely useless .
the categories need to indicate something that they choose , not the one that defines them .
you often see this problem with these enormous amounts of funds .
allegedly , who are they informing ?
my fourth category : complexity .
it turns out that we can handle much more information than what we think , if we just manage it a little bit .
we have to increase complexity gradually .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s look at a complicated decision , the purchase of a car .
this is a german car manufacturer that allows you to fully complete it .
you have to take 60 decisions , to put the car together .
and these decisions vary in the number of choices each offers .
color , outdoor color . i &apos;m 56 possibilities .
engine , change box , four choices .
what i &apos;m going to do is to vary the order in which the decisions appear .
so half the clients are going to go from lots of options , 56 colors , at a few , four boxes .
the other half of the peers are going to go from a few options , four , 56 color boxes , many options .
and what am i going to look at ?
how much you are involved .
if you always embarrass yourself in every decision , it indicates that they are overwhelmed , whatever -- we &apos;re missing them .
we find that the ones who go from lots of choices to a few , will push the default button again and again , and again .
we lose them .
if you go from a few choices to a lot , they continue there .
the same information , the same number of choices .
the only thing i did was wreck the order that the information comes in .
if we start with the easy , you learn how to choose .
even though the choosing of the change box doesn &apos;t say anything about the preferences of the interior , anyway , it makes us for choice .
we &apos;re excited about a product we &apos;re building that now has more <unk> with the process .
to sum up .
i &apos;ve talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of choice : cutting , cutting out , eliminating odd alternatives , make it real ; we can aggregate more categories with less choices ; we can replace complexity .
all these techniques i presented to you were designed to help drive the choices , or better , to use them in their business , or for the people who serve .
i think that the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful to pick .
and the more we can be careful in our elections , we can better practice the art of choice .
thank you very much .
hello . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , the youtube <unk> , and i look at youtube videos in a professional way .
it &apos;s true .
so today we &apos;re going to see why videos are made viral and how important that is .
we all want to be stars : celebrities , singers -- when i was younger , that seemed like something very , very difficult .
but today the web video makes any of us , or of our actions , copper in one part of our global culture .
anybody can be famous on the internet in a <unk> .
over 48 hours of video goes up to youtube for a minute .
and , of those , only one small percentage gets viral , you get lots of views and makes cultural <unk> .
how does that happen ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> communities and surprise factor .
well , let &apos;s start .
oh , my god , my god .
my god !
wow !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> put this video posted outside of his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was seen 23 million times .
this graph shows the breeding at the height of the summer .
<unk> don &apos;t write a viral video .
i just wanted to share a double rainbow .
that &apos;s what you do if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain .
i had published many videos of nature .
this video had been published in january .
so what happened here ?
it was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> this <unk> that sent the video to popularity .
the creators of trends like jimmy <unk> present new and <unk> them to a wider audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . you have to start friday . you all want the end of the week , on the end of a week . friday , we started friday . you wouldn &apos;t think we could have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
&quot; friday , &quot; rebecca is one of the most popular videos in the year .
you saw it almost 200 million times this year .
this graph shows the frequency of use .
just like , &quot; you know , this video appeared to have emerged from nothing .
so what happened this day ?
well , it was friday , it &apos;s true .
and if you ask for those other spikes , they &apos;re also friday .
but what happened this day , this particular friday ?
well , he took <unk> and many blog blogs started writing about it .
michael <unk> , <unk> science , was one of the first people to make a joke about video on twitter .
but the important thing is that a person or a string @-@ up a view and share it with a wider audience , speeding up the process .
so , this community of people who share this big inner joke then starts talking about that and doing things .
and now there are 10,000 <unk> of youtube on youtube .
only in the first seven days , there was a parody for each of other day .
unlike 20th @-@ century entertainment , this community participation is our way to be part of the suv or doing something new with that .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is an <unk> animation with a music made .
so , that &apos;s it .
this year you saw it about 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s weird , you know there &apos;s a three @-@ hour version that &apos;s been seen four million times .
even the cats saw this video .
and there are cats that you saw the video .
but the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the internet <unk> community .
there were <unk> .
somebody made a version of the old .
and then international became international .
suddenly , there was a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be part of .
because today we don &apos;t just enjoy , we participate .
who could have predicted something like this ?
who could have predicted &quot; <unk> , &quot; or &quot; rebecca <unk> ? &quot;
what script could have written this situation ?
in a world where two days of video go up for a minute , only that single and unexpected can be summed up in the way that these things have done .
when a friend told me that i had to see this great video of a kind that protest against <unk> in new york , that i wouldn &apos;t get too interested .
i was criticized for <unk> for <unk> , but there are often obstacles that will let you right through the <unk> .
thanks to the surprise effect and his mood , casey <unk> had five million seeing and understood his idea .
so this approach is worth all the new things we do in a creative way .
and all of this leads us to a big question .
what does this mean ?
<unk> .
what does this mean ?
the creators of a tendency , the creative , the fully unexpected , are characteristics of a new type of media , of a new culture that we all have access to , and is the audience that defines the popularity .
as i said before , one of the current celebrities of the world , justin , began on youtube .
don &apos;t ask permission to express your ideas .
now we &apos;re all a little owners of our pop culture .
these are not the characteristics of older media , but they &apos;re only the ones of today &apos;s media , but they &apos;re replacing the future &apos;s entertainment .
thank you .
how i can <unk> in 10 minutes about women &apos;s links for more than three generations , how the incredible force of those ties lies in the life of a four @-@ year @-@ old girl , next to her sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a little boat in the sea of china , more than 30 years ago , that girl left her life .
this is not a final story .
it &apos;s a jigsaw puzzle that is still attached .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who is burning the work of a lifetime .
he &apos;s a poet , a <unk> , a man whose whole life had been honored in the unique hope of oneness and freedom in his country .
<unk> as the communist <unk> , <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain .
the words , so long @-@ educated , are now tortured .
he <unk> in silence .
he died through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget her story .
my task was not to let the fact that that it was in vain , and my lesson was learning that the story was tried to persuade him , but i listened to him .
the next part of the puzzle is about a boat that is bare to the sea .
my mother , <unk> , was only 18 years old when her father died , and a marriage and two little girls .
for her , life had gone through one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was inconceivable for her that she could not do it .
and then after a four @-@ year @-@ old <unk> , a boat would be dressed up into the sea floor .
all the adults knew the risks .
the greatest fear was pirated , rape and death .
like most of the adults , my mother had a poison <unk> .
if i could catch up , we would first take my sister and i would , and then she and my grandmother .
my first memories are from that boat , the constant pace of the engine , <unk> it on every wave , and the vast and <unk> horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came a number of times , but they went with the courage of the men on our boat , or the engine dying , and not being killed by six hours .
but i do remember the lights on the oil rig in front of the malaysia , and the young man who collapsed and died , end the journey was too much for him , and the first apple i tried , given by the men on the platform .
no apple after the same flavor .
after three months in a refugee camp , i hid in melbourne .
and the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations , giving a new life together .
we set up in <unk> , a worker <unk> , whose population is comprised of immigrants .
unlike the suburbs of middle class , whose existence was , in <unk> , had no sense of the right .
the smells that came from the shops were the rest of the world .
and the bits of english that were associated with people who had one thing in common : they were starting again .
my mother worked in farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , twice .
yet , he found time to study english and get a title in i.t. .
we were poor .
all the dollars were raised , and yet one educated record in english and mathematics , it didn &apos;t care what was required to take off , which was usually new clothing , it was always the second hand .
two mid @-@ school pairs , one to hide holes in the other .
a uniform to the ankles , because i had to last six years .
and there were freaks and <unk> over the <unk> eyes and some graffiti : &quot; <unk> , come back home . &quot;
home , where ?
something in me <unk> .
i was compiling determination and a voice saying , &quot; i &apos;m going to destroy you . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i <unk> in the same bed .
my mother was <unk> every night , but we told us about our day and her the movements of our grandmother at home .
my mother ached , all the ship .
and my task was to be awake until its nightmares began to be <unk> .
she opened a computer shop , then she studied to be evicted and opened another business .
and the women would come in with their stories about men who couldn &apos;t make the transition , angry and <unk> , and boys locked in between two worlds .
there were <unk> and sponsors .
and they created centers .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , it was the classical student , <unk> with what i witnessed .
in the other one , i was in <unk> lives , tragically <unk> by violence , abuse of drugs and isolation .
but a lot of help over the years .
and because of that work , when i studied my last year of <unk> , i was elected the italian of the year .
and i was <unk> from one piece of the jigsaw to the other , but the edges were not <unk> .
so inviting me , anonymous <unk> <unk> , was now giving him , <unk> and social activist , invited to speak at sites that i &apos;d never heard of , and at home whose existence she would never have conceived .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
i didn &apos;t know how to use <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to retreat into the meals and to the living in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending up as they did for nearly 20 years , <unk> on the day of every single one and <unk> , the three still in the same bed .
and i told my mom that she could not do it .
it reminded me that i had now the same age that she had when we got on the boat .
the &quot; had never been an option .
do it , &quot; he told me , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you wouldn &apos;t do . &quot;
so i talked about juvenile <unk> and education and training it to the <unk> and the <unk> .
and the more frankly i was speaking , the more i was praised to speak .
i met people from all the pathways of life , many of them do what they loved , living on the border of what they can .
and even though i finished my undergraduate degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t stay on a race of <unk> .
there must be another piece of the puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s well being an unknown , a newly arrived , new onstage -- and not only that it &apos;s okay , but it &apos;s something that i &apos;m grateful , a gift of the boat .
because being inside can easily mean by <unk> the horizons , it can easily mean your assumptions of your province .
i gave the enough steps outside of my comfort zone to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not the way we fear .
possibilities that had not been colonized by <unk> .
there was an energy there , a <unk> optimism , a rare mix of humility and courage .
so i kept my intuition .
i joined a small group of people for whom the slogan &quot; can &apos;t be made , &quot; was a memorable challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a penny .
at the end of every day , i made a giant soup pot that we all share .
we worked even at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but some brilliant , and we opened up .
i made the decision of <unk> the u.s.
after a single trip .
my hunch again .
three months later , i had moved on , and adventure continued .
before i finish , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when <unk> was the social norm and the local mandarin was the person who mattered .
life had not changed by centuries .
her father died soon after she was born .
the mother raised only .
when she was 17 , she became a mandarin <unk> whose mother beat her .
without the support of her husband , she caused a stroke to the <unk> and her cause herself , and much more <unk> caused when she won .
the &quot; can &apos;t be done &quot; showed himself .
i was in the shower at the front of a hotel in <unk> when she died , a thousand miles , in melbourne .
i looked through the shower <unk> and i watched her standing on the other side .
i knew i &apos;d come to <unk> .
my mother called for minutes later .
days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his coffin .
we tell him stories and we tell him that we were still with it .
at night a monk came in and told us that he had to close his coffin .
my mother asked us to hold her hand .
he asked the monk , &quot; why is his hand hot , and the rest of the body so cold ? &quot;
because you &apos;ve taken your hand since the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they haven &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a nerve in our family , it runs through the women .
since we were and how life formed us , we can see that the men who would have come to our lives would have upset us .
the defeat would have easily <unk> .
now i want to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
who could wish that for himself ?
however , i fear the privilege of the easy , the right .
can i give you a <unk> in your life , wasting every wave , the constant rhythm of the engine , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give you and see you safely , i would .
<unk> <unk> and also the mother who is here in the fourth or fifth line .
i &apos;m here to share my photograph .
or is it a photograph ?
because , of course , they &apos;re photographs that you can &apos;t take with your cameras .
my interest in photography was awakened to my first digital camera at 15 years .
he <unk> with my previous passion for the drawing , but he was a little different because using the camera the process was in planning .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the <unk> .
for me , photography had more to do with being in the right place , at the right time .
it seemed that anybody could do it .
so i wanted to create something different , a process that started pressing the <unk> .
pictures like this : a construction on a very <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected spin .
and , despite that , it keeps a level of <unk> .
or pictures like these -- dark and colorful pictures at a time , but with the common goal of keeping the realism level .
and when i say <unk> , i say <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that i could always hear , but i always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph .
pictures you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick .
it has more to do with capturing an idea that can capture a moment .
but what is the trick that makes them look real ?
are the details , or the color ?
does the light intervene ?
what does the illusion create ?
sometimes the illusion is the perspective .
but in the end , it &apos;s our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a two @-@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s actually not about whether it &apos;s realistic , it &apos;s what we think it &apos;s realistic .
so i think the foundation are very simple .
i see it as a jigsaw puzzle , the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality .
i &apos;ll show you a simple example .
here are three perfectly imaginable , something we can all relate to the three @-@ dimensional world .
but they combined in a way that they can create something that still looks three @-@ dimensional , as if they existed .
but at the same time , we know it doesn &apos;t exist .
so let &apos;s face the brain because the brain doesn &apos;t accept the fact that that that that doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process by combining the photographs .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
and the things that make a realistic photograph seem to be those in which we don &apos;t even think about -- the things that surrounded us in our everyday life .
but by combining pictures , it &apos;s very important to consider it , because otherwise something will be wrong .
so i &apos;d like to say that there are three simple rules that can continue to achieve realistic outcomes .
as you can see , these images are not very special .
but by combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective .
second , the pictures combined must have the same type of light .
and these two images are played with these requirements ; they were taken at the same height and with the same type of light .
the third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the various images with a perfect union .
it has to be impossible to see where the image is activated .
by measuring the color , the contrast and the <unk> on the edges of the images between the imagery , by adding <unk> as depth of the field , colors <unk> and noise , <unk> the boundaries between the various images and we make it look a single , despite a picture can actually have hundreds of layers .
this is another example .
you might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is manipulated .
but this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place that you don &apos;t need to put in danger the ideas you have on your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and as i thought , this idea in the winter , i knew that i had several months to <unk> , to find different location for the puzzle pieces .
for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
the shore are from a different location .
the aquaponics was captured in a stone pit .
and yes , i even did a red house on top of the island so it looks more like swedes .
so to make a realistic outcome , i think you need planning .
you always start with a sketch , an idea .
then you have to combine the different photographs .
and here each piece is very well understood .
if you do a good job by taking the pictures , the outcome can be so beautiful and at a very realistic time .
all the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk about why many projects of health fail .
and i think , really , the most important thing about that is that we stopped listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at <unk> university was we witnessed a principal of the listening .
and not in a very scientific way , she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients , family and known , &quot; what happens ? &quot;
&quot; how can we help him ? &quot;
and we tend to think , that this is one of the biggest problems that we all , or maybe not all , but most projects of and wellness fail , because we stopped listening .
this is my <unk> scaling . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it has an encryption on its switch and off .
every morning i get up .
and yes , i have a challenge as you can see .
i had the challenge of getting up to 95 kilograms .
but it &apos;s so simple , that every time i link to you , it sends my information to google health .
and my doctor at <unk> has access to him as well , he can see what my weight problem is , not at the same time when he needs <unk> or some urgency of that style , but he can see it backwards .
but there &apos;s another thing .
like some of you know , i have over 4,000 followers on twitter .
so , every morning i clicked on my cell scale , and before i go up to my car , people start telling me , &quot; <unk> , today i think you need a light lunch . &quot;
that &apos;s the best thing that can happen , because it &apos;s peer @-@ to @-@ peer pressure to help patients , because it could be used for obesity , and also for patients to stop smoking .
on the other hand , you can <unk> it to move people from your chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control over your health .
from next week , it will be available .
this little <unk> attached to an iphone or another device .
and people can , from their homes , take their blood pressure , send it to their doctor , share it with each other , for example , for 100 dollars .
this is the point where patients are taking a position , they come back to their control and to be captains of their own boat , but it can also help us to care about the challenges that we face , like the firing of the cost of care costs , the demand and other issues .
making techniques that are simple to use and start with it to engage patients in the team .
and you can do it with techniques like this , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we did want to share with you with a video .
we all have pipeline of navigation on cars .
maybe we even have them in our phones .
we know perfectly where the atms are .
also where are all the <unk> .
and of course , we can find rapid food chains .
but where is the closest <unk> to help this patient ?
we did not know .
no one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now .
what we did was we formulated in the netherlands .
we created a website , and we asked the public to say , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please decide where , and when it &apos;s open , &quot; because sometimes you open up the pub for office and others are closed .
and over 10,000 <unk> , they were introduced in the netherlands .
the next step was to look for the application for that .
and we did an app for the ipad .
we created an app for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these <unk> .
and every time they &apos;re in the city of <unk> and someone collapses , they can use your iphone , and within weeks , use your cellphone from microsoft to find the closest <unk> , which can save lives .
and from today , i would like to introduce this one , not just as <unk> <unk> , which is the name of the product , but also as <unk> .
and we criticized them globally .
we &apos;re sending all the colleagues in the world , in other universities , to help us find , work and act as a hub for the throughout the world .
every time you &apos;re on holiday and somebody can be a relative or somebody in front of you , you can find it .
i also wanted to invite companies around the world who could help us with these <unk> .
you could be a <unk> or you could be a vegetarian service , let &apos;s see if the card shows is still in your place .
please , invest in it and not just improve health , but take control of it .
thank you very much .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little firm is looking to engage with the environment that is focused on ...
the distributed collaboration .
this is a little video of what we do .
mm : wait a moment .
you can take a little bit to charge .
we can -- we can continue to -- we better leave the video on one side ...
no .
this is not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
oh , did i run my time ?
all right . thank you very much .
a couple of years ago , i set up an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work on an environment that represents almost everything that we &apos;re supposed to do ; we asked them to work on the government .
the initiative was called <unk> <unk> for america and they would be like a <unk> for <unk> .
we select a few members every year and we took them to work with the municipalities .
instead of the third world , we sent them into the marine world .
they did big applications ; they worked with <unk> employees .
your task is to show the possibilities of current technology .
meet al .
it &apos;s a fire hydrant from the boston city .
here &apos;s as if i looked for a quote , but what i &apos;m really looking for is somebody clean it up when it &apos;s caught by snow , because it knows that it &apos;s not very good to release when it &apos;s covered by a foot of snow .
how did he get to ask help in this particular way ?
last year in boston , we had a team of <unk> for america .
they were there in february , and at that time they spent so much last year .
they realized that the city never wiped out these <unk> .
but one of the members called erik <unk> , he noticed something else : citizens compared to <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them .
so he did as any good programmer , he developed an app .
it &apos;s a nice application in which you can take a fire hydrant .
you accept <unk> when you win .
when you do that , you put a name on it , in this case you put al .
if you don &apos;t , somebody can kill you .
i mean , it has a playful component .
it &apos;s a modest application .
maybe it &apos;s the youngest of the 21st uses that are happening last year .
but it does something that no other technology in the government does .
and it spreads in viral form .
a responsible system of city <unk> by seeing this application realized that it could be used , not by snow , but by the citizens of the <unk> of the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these tar sands work , but people steal the batteries .
that &apos;s why it tells the citizens to control them .
and then seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> .
and chicago just finished throwing it out to make people stand up to clean sidewalks when they were empty .
so now we know nine cities that we &apos;ll use it .
and this has spread out without <unk> , organically .
if you know a little bit of government technology , you know that this doesn &apos;t normally happen .
the software acquisition usually takes a couple of years .
last year in boston , we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months .
it was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children .
then they told us that , in fact , because of the normal channels would have taken at least two years and a half million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
now there &apos;s a project in the california <unk> that has up to 2,000 million dollars and doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app which shows up in a couple of days and spreads in viral form is a kind of warning about the institution of the government .
it suggests the best way to work , not like private companies , as many people think it should be .
neither like a technology company , but rather like the internet itself .
i mean , without <unk> , in the open and <unk> way .
and that &apos;s important .
but the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of dealing with the question of the government that has the new generation , not as a problem of an institution , but as a collective action problem .
and that &apos;s very good because it turns out that we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
and there &apos;s a very large community of people who are building the tools for them to bend together effectively .
and it &apos;s not just &apos; shows for america , but there are hundreds of people across the country who contribute to civil applications every day in their own communities .
they have not given up with the government .
they feel a great frustration before that , but they don &apos;t complain about it .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from sight .
and it &apos;s that if we put aside the feelings about politics , the row in the front , and all those other things that put us crazy , the government is essentially , in the words of tim or <unk> , &quot; what we do together because we can &apos;t . &quot;
now , many people have deserted the government .
if you are one of those people , i would ask you to question it , because things are changing .
politics does not change ; the government does .
and because the government ultimately raises from us -- remember that from &quot; we , the people &quot; ? the way they think about it will affect how they make change .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started with this .
and as many people thought that the government was in choosing people to make any charges .
well , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that the government is , above all , <unk> .
this is the telephone center of service and information .
it &apos;s the place that you address the phone calls if you mark the u.s.
if you ever have the opportunity to work in a center of the city called scott <unk> like part of this initiative -- in fact , everybody else will find that people call the government with a very broad range of issues , even when they find a <unk> at home .
scott <unk> this call .
he entered &quot; <unk> &quot; at the heart of official knowledge .
he didn &apos;t find anything . he started with animal control .
and finally he said , &quot; hey , can you open your house doors , put strong music and see if it &apos;s gone ? &quot;
and it worked . so , scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the <unk> .
boston has no call center .
it has an app , web and mobile phone called <unk> .
don &apos;t give that application .
it was the work of very intelligent people on the office of new <unk> .
one day , this really happened , came up with this request , &quot; <unk> in my garbage cube . i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s dead .
how do i do to leave you ? &quot;
the <unk> dynamic is different .
scott was speaking in person .
freestyle itself is all public , so everyone can see this .
in this case , he saw a neighbor .
the next report said , &quot; i went up to the location , i found the garbage cube behind the house .
coincidence ? yeah . yeah ? yeah .
i turned the cube back . i went home .
good evening , sweet pepper . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . it &apos;s the confluence of the digital and the physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of the income of the government to the distributed collaboration .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean the technical definition here .
i talk about a platform for people to come up and help others .
so , a citizen helped another , but here the government had a key role .
he connected to both people .
and it could be connected to the government services of being needed , but the neighbor is a better and cheaper choice than government services .
when a neighbor helps another , it <unk> communities .
if we call animal control , that costs a lot of money .
one important thing we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same as policy .
a lot of people understand it , but you think you &apos;re the input from the other .
our entry into the government system is the vote .
how many times have you chosen a political leader , sometimes we spend a lot of energy on choosing a new political leader , and then we expect the government to redirect our values and challenge , but we don &apos;t see changes .
that &apos;s because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 feet .
below that &apos;s what we call <unk> .
and we say that word with a lot of contempt .
but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps what it belongs to us as something that operates on our counter , that other thing , and therefore we &apos;re losing power .
people think politics is sensual .
if we want this institution to work , we will have to make the bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government work occurs .
we have to collaborate with the machinery of government .
that makes <unk> movement .
have you seen them ?
it &apos;s a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the <unk> of the financial reform project .
that &apos;s not political activism , it &apos;s bureaucratic activism .
and for those of us who are confronted with the government , it &apos;s time for us to ask what world we want to leave our children .
you have to look at the enormous challenges that they have to confront .
do you really believe that we &apos;re going to get where we have to go without solving the institution that can be acting on behalf of everyone ?
we can &apos;t without government , we need it to be more effective .
the good news is that with technology , it &apos;s possible to rethink the function of government , so that it can spread the civil society .
there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet and knows that it &apos;s not that hard to act by focusing , you only have to articulate the systems in the right way .
the average age of our members is 28 years old , so i , <unk> , i &apos;m a older generation than many of them .
this is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving it almost by sitting .
they &apos;re not giving that battle that we all face about who &apos;s going to talk about ; they &apos;re all going to talk .
they can express their opinions at any time and they do it .
so when they face the government problem , they don &apos;t much care about making their voices .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they put their hands on the work to program applications that make the government better .
and those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
it can be stored by raising a fire fire hydrant , withdraw from a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside .
of course , we were always able to have those <unk> and many people do .
but these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers , we are not only government consumers who pay tax and we get services .
we are more than that : we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix the government until we don &apos;t digest the citizenship .
so i want to ask everybody here , when it comes to the important things we have to do together , all together , will we be a crowd of voices , or will we also be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
i usually try to explain to people the wonderful thing that are going to be the new technologies that are emerging . you have to look back to understand what &apos;s happening . here i want to tell you what i think of these big technological breakthroughs , so far we can hardly see the rhythm .
i &apos;ll start by showing a slide on technology , very boring .
please , if you can put it ...
it &apos;s a diagram anybody i took from a file of me .
i &apos;m not so interested to show you the details , but the general aspect .
this is an analysis that we were doing on the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that this , as many other people we tend to see , is a kind of a straight line on a log scale .
in other words , each step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance .
talking about technology with <unk> curves is something new .
here &apos;s a weird thing .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m going to talk about .
please light up the lights .
it would take more intensity because it took over paper .
why would we line technological curves for scale ?
the answer is , if i draw them on a normal curved line in which , let &apos;s say , these are the years , or some time unit , and this would be any measure of the technology i would like , the diagram would look like something ridiculous .
it would be something like this .
he doesn &apos;t say too much .
but if we did , for example , some other technology , like transportation , on a curved curve would be very silly , we would see a straight line .
but if something like this , you get a quantum change .
if the technology of transportation would be as fast as the microprocessors , we could take a taxi and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
but don &apos;t go through that rhythm .
there is no unprecedented in the history of technological development of a few years ahead of the order of magnitude .
the question i want to argue is -- we see these exponential curves , we see they don &apos;t continue forever .
you can &apos;t sustain this change as fast as it goes .
it will happen one of two things .
or you will well become a typical s like this , until something completely different comes out , or maybe it will do something like this .
that &apos;s all that can happen .
i &apos;m optimistic , so i think maybe something like this .
if we were like that , now we would be in the middle of a transition .
in this line , we &apos;re in a transition from what used to be the world , a new way .
so what i &apos;m trying to ask , and i wonder , is , what is that new way around the world ?
what new state is the world heading ?
the transition looks very , very confusing if we &apos;re in it .
i remember growing up as a child in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000 .
this is a conference where people talk about the future , and we see the future continues to be 2000 .
that &apos;s all we see .
in other words , the future has <unk> , year after year , through my life .
but i think it &apos;s because we feel that something is happening .
there is a transformation . we can feel it .
and we know that it doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense to think of 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than shipping what we &apos;re doing today doesn &apos;t make any sense .
so i want to talk to you about how that could be , how that transition could be .
but to do that , i &apos;ll have to talk a little bit about things that don &apos;t have a lot to do with technology and computing .
because i think the only way to understand it is to take a distance and look at the long @-@ term things .
the time scale i &apos;d like to do is the time of life on earth .
i think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years .
so , we went back about 2.5 billion years when the earth was a big barren rock with a lot of chemicals surrounding it .
if you look at the way those chemicals organized , you give us an idea of how things happened .
and i think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of rna . i &apos;m going to tell you a simple version of this , and that is , at that time , i had floating around with all sorts of <unk> of chemicals in its interior .
some of those oil drops were embedded in a particular combination of chemicals that made them into the exterior and so on growing blobs .
and they started being broken .
in a sense , those were the most primitive cell forms -- those oil <unk> .
but those drops were not alive , in the current sense , because each of them had a random prescription of chemicals .
and every single time you pour an unequal distribution of the chemicals inside .
so every stride was a little different .
in fact , the drops that somehow became better than an hour of adding the chemicals around ; they grew more chemicals and became more chemical <unk> .
usually they lived longer , they were more represented .
it was a form of life , chemical life , very simple , but things got interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction .
in some way that we don &apos;t really understand very well these <unk> learned how to store information .
they learned to store information , which was the recipe for the cell , in a special chemical called dna .
in other words , <unk> in this evolution without sense , a two @-@ year @-@ old writing system allowed them to record what was incredible is that that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago .
our recipe , our genes , have exactly the same code , that same writing system .
in fact , every living being expressed exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
and one of the things i did just for fun -- we can now write things with this code .
here i have 100 <unk> of white dust that i try to hide people from the airport .
but it contains -- <unk> this code -- the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and i wrote my personal data in this clip of dna and i printed it 10 at 22 times .
so if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card , i have many for everyone here , in fact , for every single person in the world and it &apos;s here .
if i were a <unk> , i would have put it in a virus and i &apos;d spread it out into the room .
what was the next step ?
writing dna was an interesting step .
this made these cells happy . another one billion years ago .
but then there was another big interesting step in which things got really different , and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form and to form cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know , but bacteria can exchange dna .
so , for example , evolved antibiotic resistance .
some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little dna with other bacteria and now there &apos;s a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate .
this communication gave rise to the communities that , in a sense , were together in that , and there was a synergy .
and in that <unk> , or <unk> together , or whether a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were getting more obnoxious by evolution .
and the turning point happened when these communities came so close that , in fact , they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board into a string of dna .
the next interesting stage for life took another billion years .
and at that stage , we have <unk> communities , many different types of cells working together as one organism alone .
in fact , we are a <unk> community .
we have lots of cells that don &apos;t act alone .
the skin cell doesn &apos;t work without the heart , or the muscle cell , or the brain , etc .
so , these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than cell , something we call an organism .
the next level happened within these communities .
these started <unk> information .
and to build very special structures that didn &apos;t do more than processing information in the community .
they &apos;re the neural structures .
the neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile communities built .
in fact , they started <unk> within the community being responsible for processing , understanding and transmitting information .
those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that moment as individuals -- learning was confined to the length of an organism , and not the evolutionary period .
so , an organism could , for example , learn not to eat any fruit , because he knew badly and he got sick the last time he ate it .
that could happen during the life of an organism that had previously built these information @-@ processing structures that by evolution would have learned over hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit .
so the fact that the nervous system builds up those structures of information extremely accelerated the evolutionary process .
because evolution could now happen confined to an individual .
it could happen in time necessary to learn .
but then , of course , the individuals discovered the trick of communication .
so , for example , the most refined version we know is human language .
if we think about it , it &apos;s an incredible invention .
i have a very complicated idea , a vague idea in my head .
i &apos;m here sitting emitting some <unk> and , hopefully , building a similar idea , vague and confused , in his head that had some analogy with me .
but we took something very complicated , we converted it into sound , in sound sequences , and we make something very complicated in another brain .
that now lets us start working as a organism .
in fact , as humanity , we &apos;ve started doing <unk> .
now we go through similar periods to the multicellular organisms , we prescribe our recording methods , presentation and information processing .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
the computer , the i.t. tape , the cd @-@ rom , etc . , are the trained mechanisms that we built to handle that information .
and that brings us into something much larger , faster and able to evolve more than we did before .
now evolution can happen at microseconds .
you saw the evolutionary <unk> in which it produced some evolution with the <unk> program , before our eyes .
and now we &apos;ve accelerated time again .
the first stages of the story that took a billion years to each .
the next stages , the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
the next , language and so forth , led less than one million years .
and the next , like the electronics , it just looks like taking a few decades .
the process <unk> ; i guess self @-@ <unk> is the right word to name something that <unk> its own rhythm of change .
the more it changes , the faster it does .
and i think that &apos;s what we see in this explosion of the curve .
we see the process <unk> .
but i make my living by designing computers , and i know that the working mechanisms for <unk> wouldn &apos;t be possible without the recent computer advances .
but now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible to me in a conventional way .
i don &apos;t know what each transistor does in that string of connections does .
there are billions .
instead , with the designers of <unk> <unk> , we think of an abstraction , we put it on the machine and the machine with that makes something that you could never get , it goes far further and faster than ever before .
in fact , sometimes it uses methods that we don &apos;t even understand right .
a particularly interesting method , which i &apos;ve been using lately is evolution itself .
within the machine , an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds .
and , for example , in the most extreme cases , we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions .
we say , &quot; for computer , can you run a hundred million sequences of random instructions ?
would you run these sequences of random instructions , run all those shows , and take those that we want to get to what we want to do ? &quot;
in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want numbers , just to give you a simple example .
so , we found the programs that get closer to these numbers .
of course , there &apos;s unlikely a few random instruction sequences in the world , so no one of them succeeded .
but one , luckily , could put two numbers into the right order .
and i said , &quot; computer , could you take 10 percent of those random random random sequences made the task better ?
we drilled through those and <unk> the rest .
and now they did better than the numbers better .
and let &apos;s go back to an analog process to sex . &quot;
let &apos;s take two programs , let &apos;s take kids , we &apos;ll recognize them , and the children will perceive the properties of both programs .
so we got a new generation of programs that had a little more success .
and we say , &quot; please repeat the process . &quot;
again , again .
you put a few mutations in .
and he tries again and reproduced with another generation .
well , every generation carries a few milliseconds .
so i can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or , in complicated cases , in hours .
in the end , we ended up with programs that report absolutely perfect .
in fact , these are much more efficient programs than i could have written by hand .
if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i &apos;ve been trying to analyze them to see how they work .
these are dark , strange programs .
but they did the task .
in fact , i know , i have the security that they achieve the goal because they come from a hundred thousand shows that they did .
in fact , their lives depended on making it .
once i &apos;d go on a 747 , and it &apos;ll take a card and it says , &quot; look at this .
he says , &quot; this airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a safe flying . don &apos;t you feel comfortable ? &quot;
we know that the engineering processes don &apos;t work very well when they become complicated .
so we started to rely on computers to make very different design processes .
and that allows us to produce much more complex things than what makes normal engineering .
however , we don &apos;t understand all the choices there .
in that sense , it goes ahead of us .
now we use these programs to do much faster computers and so we can run these programs much faster .
i mean , they <unk> .
the thing goes faster and faster , and i think it looks so <unk> .
because all these technologies aligned .
we are drowning .
and we &apos;re at an analog moment to the one @-@ celled organisms when they became multicellular .
we are the <unk> , and we can &apos;t understand what the hell are we creating .
we &apos;re at the tipping point .
but i think something comes behind us .
i think it would be really arrogant about our part to think that we are the end of evolution .
and i think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it comes .
but now , lunch comes , and i think i &apos;ll stop here before i &apos;ll stop .
my story starts at <unk> about two years ago .
i was in the desert , under the <unk> skies , with the evangelical <unk> singer .
we were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the indian <unk> &quot; the mahabharata &quot;
in those days when we indian people wanted to travel , we wanted to travel into a chariot and heavens .
now we do it with airplanes .
at that time when i was born , the great indian poet , had thirst , took a bow and with a <unk> on the ground , she was finding water .
now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines .
the conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic .
and that made me very much .
every time i felt a little more than <unk> .
i had this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if i didn &apos;t have the camera , if i couldn &apos;t afford my friends .
it seemed to me that technology had to let the magic , don &apos;t digest .
as a child , my grandfather gave me his silver lining of his pocket .
and this piece of technology for 50 years was for my most magical thing .
it became a golden gateway for a world full of images , of pirate and <unk> in my imagination .
i had the feeling that mobile phone , luxury clocks and the cameras keep pouring in .
it &apos;s our inspiration .
so i set up , i threw myself into this tech world to see how we use it to make magic , rather than using it .
i illustrate books from 16 years .
so when i saw the ipad , i saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the whole world .
you can know how we take the book .
where we are .
put the text together with the image , the animation , the sound and touch .
storytelling becomes increasingly <unk> .
but what does that serve us ?
i &apos;m about to throw <unk> , an interactive application for the ipad .
he says , &quot; take your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so ... <unk> : &quot; this box belongs to &quot; -- i write my name .
and so i go back to a character of the book .
in a number of moments , i get a <unk> -- the ipad knows where i live by gps -- which comes to me .
my inner child gets together with all these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
and i don &apos;t mean magicians and <unk> , but that childhood magic , those ideas that we call children .
for some reason , fireflies in a jar were always exhilarating .
so , over here , we have to <unk> the ipad to release fireflies .
and , really , really , they cut your way into what the book is .
another idea that i fascinated with as a child was that a whole galaxy hung on a <unk> .
so here , every book and every world becomes a <unk> that i refer to this magical device within the device .
and this opens up a map .
in every field of fantasy , there have always been maps , but there have been <unk> maps .
this is a map that grows , <unk> and <unk> you during the rest of the book .
in certain points of the book , it also reveals itself .
now i &apos;m going to go in .
another extremely important aspect to me is to create indian content and contemporary time .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard about fairies and <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian counterparts , the <unk> ?
these poor <unk> have been trapped on solo cameras over millennia , in an old , moist , <unk> book .
so we &apos;re bringing them back into a contemporary child story .
in a story that deals with the issues today as the environment crisis .
and , speaking of the environmental crisis , one of the last 10 years has been that children have been locked in their pcs , have gone outside the world .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids out into the natural world with their technology .
one of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go abroad , take the camera or the ipad , and gather images of different natural objects .
as a child , i had a lot of collections : sticks , stones and shells .
for some reason kids don &apos;t .
so to restore this ritual of childhood , you have to go out and , in a chapter , give a photo to a blossom and then proceed .
in another chapter , you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk> .
so this is a digital collection of photographs that you can then put on the web .
a kid in london puts a photo of a fox and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox . &quot;
a indian child says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
and you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that have been collected .
within the variants of connection between magic , earth and technology , there are many possibilities .
in the next book , we had an interaction in which one comes out with the ipad and video is controlled and by augmented reality , you see a group of <unk> that appear on the inside the house .
at one point , the screen is full of leaf leaves .
and you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> it so you can read the rest of the book .
let &apos;s go into a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology are reaching each other .
we take the energy from the sun .
we are approaching our children and ourselves in the natural world and that magic , joy and child love with a simple story .
thank you .
this is for me a true honor .
i &apos;ve spent most of the time in prisons and in death row .
i &apos;ve spent most of my life in <unk> communities , in projects and places where there &apos;s a lot of despair .
and being here at ted , watching and listening to these has given me a lot of energy .
one of the things i noticed in this short time , is that ted has identity .
and the things that are said here have an impact on the whole world .
occasionally , if something comes from ted , it makes sense and a force that wouldn &apos;t otherwise .
i say this because i think identity is important .
we &apos;ve seen fantastic shows here .
and i think that we have learned that words of a professor can make a lot of sense , but if you teach them with feeling , you can have a special meaning .
a doctor can do good things , if it &apos;s <unk> , it can do much more .
so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t actually learn this in the right practice , my work .
i learned it from my grandmother .
i grew up in a traditional house of an african @-@ american family dominated by a matriarch , who was my grandmother .
it was tough , it was strong , it had power .
it was the last word in every argument in the family .
she <unk> many of the <unk> in our home .
she was a daughter of people who had been a slave .
their parents were born in slavery in virginia .
she was born on the 1880s , and her experience with slavery in the same way as she watched the world .
she was tough , but she was also loving .
when i was a little kid and i looked at her , she would come up and give me a good hug .
i was so fierce that i could barely breathe , and then i was overwhelmed .
one or two hours later , i &apos;d come back and look at her , and she &apos;d come up and say , &quot; <unk> , do you still feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i told him no , he would take me back and he would say yes , he would let me in peace .
i had this human quality that made you want to always be close to her .
the only problem is i had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of 10 .
at times , when i was going to spend a time with her , it wasn &apos;t easy to catch your time and your attention .
my cousins were running all around .
i remember when i was eight or nine , i woke up one morning , i went to the room and they were running all my cousins .
my grandmother was on the other side of the room and she looked at me .
at first , i thought it was a game .
so i looked at her and looked at her , but she was very serious .
after 15 or 20 minutes , she got up , she took me through the room , and she took me out of my hand and she said , &quot; you see me . we &apos;ll both talk . &quot;
i remember this as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget .
it took me outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you can &apos;t tell anybody . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
she said , &quot; now let me suggest you won &apos;t . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
then he sat me down , he looked at me and said , &quot; i want you to be watching . &quot;
and he said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
he said , &quot; i think you can do whatever you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget .
and then she said , &quot; i just want you to take me three things , give me input . &quot;
i said , &quot; absolutely sure . &quot;
and he said , &quot; the first thing i want you to do is we always want your mother . &quot;
he said , &quot; she &apos;s my <unk> , and you have to make sure you always wear her . &quot;
like i went to my mom , i said , &quot; yeah , i &apos;ll pray . &quot;
then he told me , &quot; the second thing i want you to do is you always will do the right thing , though the right thing is difficult . &quot;
i thought about it , and i said , &quot; yeah , i &apos;ll go . &quot;
then finally , he said , &quot; what the third thing i want you to do is i &apos;ll never drink . &quot;
i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yeah , i &apos;ll do it . &quot;
i grew up in the field , in the south . i have a brother a year older and a sister a year less .
when i was 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home with a six @-@ syllable package , i don &apos;t know where he pulled them out , he grabs my sister and i left us to the forest .
we can hardly do the crazy things at all .
he took a beer drink , he offered my sister , she took a little drink and offered me to me .
i said , &quot; no , no . it &apos;s ok . you follow , but i &apos;m not going to take beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; go . come with it today . and you always do the same as we do .
i took something , your sister too . let &apos;s take a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; no . i wouldn &apos;t feel good . you can follow . &quot;
then my brother looked at me .
and he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? he takes a beer . &quot;
i went and looked at it with force , and she went , &quot; ah , you wouldn &apos;t be thinking about the conversation with <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; but what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; breast tells all the grandchildren that are special . &quot;
i was broken .
i have to admit something to you .
i &apos;ll tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t say .
i know this was widely <unk> .
but i have 52 years and i can admit that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say this by thinking it &apos;s a virtue ; i mean by the power of identity .
when we create the right type of identity , we say things to everybody else that they really don &apos;t see sense .
we can &apos;t get them to do things that they can &apos;t do .
i think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special .
my grandfather had been convicted during the court .
my uncles died of diseases related to alcohol .
and these were things that we had to engage with .
now , i &apos;ll try to talk about our criminal justice system .
this country is today very different than what was 40 years ago .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 incarcerated .
there are now 2.3 million .
in america we have the highest incarceration rate in the world .
we have seven million people in liberty .
and this mass distribution , in my opinion , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor , black communities , there is so much <unk> , so much despair , determined by these facts .
one in three black people between age 18 and 30 is in prison or in liberty .
in the urban <unk> across the country , l.a. , philadelphia , baltimore , washington , 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail or in freedom .
our system is not only distorted in front of the race , but it &apos;s also about poverty .
in this country , we have a criminal system that treat you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty , that if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
it &apos;s not guilt , it &apos;s wealth that <unk> the outcomes .
and we seem to feel very calm .
the politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems with our own .
we are out there .
i find it interesting .
we &apos;re looking at our work , some pretty curious developments .
in my state , in alabama , as well as other states , you will <unk> your rights forever if you have a criminal conviction .
right now in alabama , 34 percent of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote .
and if we toss it to the next 10 years , the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before we attribute the law to the vote .
we have this amazing silence .
i play children .
many of my peers are very young .
america is the only country in the world where children of 13 will die in prison .
we have in this country in jail for children , without the chance of ever getting out .
right now we &apos;re in process of some litigation .
the only country in the world .
i play people at death row .
this issue of death is interesting .
in a sense , you have encouraged us to think that the final question is , do people deserve to die through the ultimate <unk> ?
a very sensitive question .
but you can think differently about how we are in our identity .
there &apos;s another way to look at it : it &apos;s not about deciding whether people deserve to die through minority crimes , but if we win .
this is interesting .
death penalty in the united states is defined by mistake .
in every nine amputees , there &apos;s been identified that it &apos;s innocent that it &apos;s <unk> and released from the death row .
a bug rate , astonishing -- an innocent rate of every nine .
this is interesting .
in aviation , you would never be mega @-@ <unk> airplane if every nine you would have <unk> .
but somehow we get rid of the problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our charge .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these things .
i talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill .
it &apos;s interesting that in my classroom with students about african american history , i talk about slavery .
i tell you about terrorism , the age that started at the end of the reconstruction and lasted to world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know much about this .
but for the black americans in this country , it was a period defined by terror .
in many communities , people were afraid of being <unk> .
they were worried .
the threat of terror was what defined its life .
now there are older people who come up to me and say , &quot; mister <unk> , you speak , you make speeches . tell people to stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism , after 9 / 11 / 11 . &quot;
they ask me to say , &quot; no . say we grew up with that . &quot;
the age of terrorism went on , obviously , with <unk> and decades of rape and of separation .
in this country , we have a dynamic where we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we haven &apos;t understood what we &apos;ve done historically .
all the time i clicked on each other .
we constantly create tensions and conflicts .
it costs us to talk about races . i think it &apos;s because we &apos;re not prepared to engage with a real and reconciliation process .
in south africa , people understood that you couldn &apos;t overcome race without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
in rwanda , even before the genocide had this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t .
i was in germany giving talks about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my show and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s well disturbing to hear what you say . &quot;
he said , &quot; we have no death penalty in germany .
we can certainly never have it here . &quot;
the room stayed in silence and a lady said , &quot; there &apos;s no way our story , we can never get into the systematic death of human beings .
it would be irrational that we , intentional and <unk> , would force us to run people . &quot;
we talked about this .
how would we feel in a world where a nation like germany , <unk> people , especially if they were in their majority ?
we could not tolerate it .
it would be irrational .
and yet , in this country , in the state of the old south , we continue to run people . in the same areas where it &apos;s 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white , which if it were black , 22 times more likely to be accused of being black and its <unk> is white in the same states that are buried .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
i think our identity is in danger .
if we don &apos;t really care about these things that are so difficult , the good and wonderful things are , however , informed .
we love innovation .
we &apos;re fascinated with technology . we adore creativity .
we love entertainment .
but lately , those are well @-@ understood by suffering , abuse , degradation , degradation , <unk> .
in my view , you need to integrate both things .
we talk about the need to have more hope , more commitment , more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world .
i think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor , the israelis , who will never get to ted .
think of them is , in a sense , something that is within our being .
it &apos;s true that we have to believe in issues that we haven &apos;t seen .
we are . despite being so rational , so committed to intellectual .
with innovation , with creativity . development comes not only from brain ideas .
these things come from inherited ideas as well by their hearts .
this connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look not only at the bright and the mind , but also the dark and the hard .
<unk> <unk> , the great sufi leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe suffering , we wanted all sorts of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , guidance , for spirit , a will for being in places of despair and being watched . &quot;
well , that orientation for the spirit is basically in the heart of what i think , that even in communities like ted , we must engage it .
there is no disconnect related to technology and design , which allows us to be truly human if we don &apos;t pay attention to poverty , to <unk> , to inequality , to injustice .
now i want to warn you that these thoughts constitute a much more challenging identity than if we neglect these things .
we come back to find them .
i had the great privilege , being a very young lawyer , to meet <unk> <unk> .
she came to empathize with some frequency , to come up with two of her closest friends , older ladies , <unk> <unk> who had organized the bus <unk> , a lady <unk> , and virginia , a white lady , whose husband , <unk> , was dr. king &apos;s lawyer .
these women got together just to talk .
occasionally , the lady will admit to me , to say , &quot; <unk> , the lady comes . let &apos;s get us together to speak .
do you want to come and hear ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; yes . yes i want . &quot;
so she said , &quot; okay , what do you do when you come ? &quot;
i was incredulous , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so i went and listened to them .
it was a very <unk> , very evocative thing .
and one time i was there , listening to these ladies , and after a couple of hours , ms. dilma rousseff turned to me and said , &quot; okay now , <unk> , that that &apos;s that idea of fairness .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and i started giving my speech .
i said , &quot; okay , we &apos;re trying to question injustice .
we tried to help those who have been convicted of themselves .
we tried to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration .
we tried to end up with the sentences of life , without freedom , for kids .
we tried to do something about death penalty .
we try to reduce the population in prisons .
we tried to end with the european <unk> . &quot;
i gave her all my best speech and finally she looked at me and she said , &quot; um , . &quot;
and he said , &quot; change go out , too . &quot;
at that time , ms. dilma rousseff , put my finger on my face and said , &quot; that &apos;s why you have to be very , very courageous . &quot;
i think actually , the ted community has to be much more ticklish .
we have to find ways to look at those challenges , those problems , that suffering .
because finally , humanity depends on compassion on others .
i &apos;ve learned some very simple things in my work .
i &apos;ve been studying simple things .
i &apos;ve come to understand and believe that every one of us is above the worst we &apos;ve ever made .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
i &apos;m convinced that if somebody says a lie , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re a liar .
i &apos;m sure if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t belong to it , it &apos;s not that a burglar .
even if somebody kills another , it &apos;s not a killer .
so i think there &apos;s a basic dignity in people who must be <unk> by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country and , surely , many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
it &apos;s not .
i really think in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that even though it &apos;s very dramatic , very beautiful , very <unk> , very encouraging , we will not be distracted by our technology , by our design , not by our intellectual or rational ability .
in the end , the character of a society , not because of the way the rich , powerful and privileged , but the way the poor people deal , the <unk> , the disabled , the prisoners .
because it &apos;s in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are .
sometimes i feel <unk> . i &apos;ll end with a story .
sometimes i make too much force .
you &apos;re tired , like everyone .
sometimes those ideas go beyond my stories of an important form .
i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk> .
i go to jail and i see my 13 @-@ year @-@ olds and 14 @-@ year @-@ old clients who have been trafficked .
and i start thinking , how can it be ?
how can a judge turn somebody into what &apos;s not ?
judge <unk> her as an adult , but i see a child .
a very late night , i was thinking -- for god , if the judge can turn you into something you are not , you must have magical powers .
<unk> , <unk> , the judge has magical powers .
you should ask something about that .
as i was too late , i couldn &apos;t think correctly , but i started working on a <unk> .
i had a 14 @-@ year @-@ old client , a little black , black .
i started working on <unk> , with a <unk> who said , &quot; <unk> for my 14 @-@ year @-@ old black client to be treated like a 75 @-@ year @-@ old , executive from a corporation . &quot;
in the proverbs , i formed that there were <unk> behavior in the accusation , in the behavior of the police and in the process .
there was a dancing line about how in this country there is no ethics , but a lack of ethical .
the next morning i woke up thinking , that rented <unk> would be a dream , or i actually wrote it ?
for my horror , not only had i <unk> her , but she had sent her to the court .
they spent about two months , i &apos;d forgotten it .
and i finally decided -- oh god , i have to go to court for this stupid case .
i got up on the car , and i felt really overwhelmed , overwhelmed .
i went on the car to the court .
i thought this would be very difficult and scary .
i finally got off the car . i was walking into the court .
i was climbing up the stairs when i encountered a older black man , it was the <unk> of the court .
when he saw me , he approached me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; is you a lawyer ? &quot; i said yes .
so i got up and regretted it .
and i was drowning in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
i have to tell you now that was rude .
that was deeply connected to my interior , with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope .
well , i walked into the audiences room .
when i went in , the judge saw me .
and he said , &quot; mister <unk> , did you write this <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; sir , mister i was . &quot; and we started discussing .
people started getting there . they were all <unk> .
i was the one who had written those crazy things .
there were police on top of office workers , <unk> .
suddenly , without knowing how , the room was full of people . they all infuriated because we talked about races , because we talked about poverty , because we talked about inequality .
with the <unk> of my eye , i saw the <unk> going and coming .
i would look out the window and hear that entire <unk> .
he kept walking up here and there .
finally , this old black man , with a head of concern , came into the room and sat behind me , almost at the table of lawyers .
about 10 minutes later , the judge was <unk> .
during the break of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> had gone into the room .
the assistant <unk> over the old black .
and he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the audience ? &quot;
and the old black man stood up , he looked at the assistant , he looked at me and he said , &quot; i walked into this audience hall to tell this young man to keep his sight on the target with <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted today , because i think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large , but it <unk> over justice .
we can &apos;t be truly human if we don &apos;t care about human rights and by dignity .
our survival is tied up with each other .
that our visions of technology , design , entertainment and creativity need to beat the <unk> , <unk> and justice .
and above all , those of you who share this , i just want to tell you that keep your eye on the side with <unk> .
thank you very much .
you just hear and see a obvious desire from the audience , of this community , to help in your purposes , to do something .
something that &apos;s not a check . what can we do ?
there are many close opportunities .
if you live in the california state , for example , there will be a spring in which there will be an effort to ensure the benefits that are spent today in punishment policies .
for example , here in california , you &apos;ll spend a billion dollars on death row , over the next five years . a billion dollars .
and despite this , 46 percent of the cases of being arrested .
56 percent of women are not getting into anything .
here &apos;s a change opportunity .
this <unk> is going to propose that these funds are encouraged to apply to the law , the security .
i think there &apos;s a very close opportunity .
there has been a huge decline in crime in the united states over the last three decades .
part of the explanation is that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk> .
what would you say to those who believe it is ?
in fact , the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable .
large growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes of violence .
it &apos;s the wrong war against drugs .
that &apos;s why this dramatic increase in population <unk> .
and we kept talking about punishment .
we have three legal causes to take people to the prison chain ; to steal a bicycle , for small crime , instead of making those resources into their victims .
i think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less .
i think our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody .
i think that &apos;s the orientation that has to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve been excited about today .
you &apos;re very inspiring .
thank you very much for ted . thank you .
<unk> : the <unk> for bin laden &apos;s death .
number two : famine in somalia .
4 : <unk> posters . five : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
number 6 : social <unk> . 65 : dead .
<unk> from <unk> .
a number of <unk> : a drug war . mass destruction .
recession . due to final trial . egypt . syria .
crisis : death . disaster .
oh , my god !
these are just some of the clips i got in the last six months , and you could be over the last six days or last six years .
the idea is that press media prefer negative because our mind pays attention .
and that answers to a very good reason .
in every second of each day , our senses are significantly more data than the brain can probably process .
and we all care more about surviving , the first stop that data is an old segment of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
the amygdala is our early warning detector , the danger detector .
it extracts and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make damage .
so , from a <unk> of stories , we looked at negative stories .
that old adage of the press , &quot; if there &apos;s blood , &quot; it &apos;s very true .
and because all the digital devices give us the news seven days of the week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not surprising that we &apos;re all pessimistic .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that people think that the world goes from wrong .
but maybe it &apos;s not .
maybe , instead , what happens is we get <unk> .
perhaps the huge progress that &apos;s been done in the last century by a series of forces is rooted in such a way that we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades .
i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have our good problems : climate change , species extinction , water scarcity and energy -- we certainly have them .
as humans , we are very good at solving problems and in the long , we just did with them .
so let &apos;s look at the last century to see where we go .
in the last hundred years , the average life has been more than doubled , the average per capita income for inflation has tripled throughout the world .
child mortality has shrunk 10 times .
moreover , the cost of food , electricity , transportation and communications , has fallen 10 to 1,000 times .
steve steven showed us that we are living the most peaceful times in human history .
and charles saint that the global literacy has gone from 25 to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we &apos;re actually living an extraordinary time .
a lot of people forget .
and we continue to increase expectations higher and higher expectations .
in fact , they attribute the meaning of poverty .
think about it today in the united states , much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity , water , <unk> , cell phones , air conditioning and cars .
the <unk> <unk> of the last century , the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such luxury .
supporting a lot of this is technology and , lately , its exponential growth .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve , moore &apos;s law , and doubling the price performance by about 12 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
it &apos;s moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
i want you to look at two things on this curve .
first , the gentle thing that is -- in good and bad times , in war and in peace , in recession , in depression and booming .
it &apos;s the end of fast @-@ using computers to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t stop before any of the big challenges .
and even though he &apos;s stuck in a law on the left , the curve goes up .
the growth rate of technology is itself faster .
and on this curve , al moore &apos;s law , there &apos;s a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies we have today .
the computation in the cloud , which my friends in autodesk call infinite computing , sensors and networks , robotics , 3d printing and its capacity to democratize and distributed production across the planet , synthetic biology , fuels , and food , digital medicine , <unk> , <unk> and ai , and ai and ai .
i mean , how many did you see the victory at jeopardy &apos;s &quot; jeopardy ?
it was epic .
i looked in the newspapers , the best headline i would have .
and i loved this one : &quot; watson <unk> the human competitors . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy is not an easy game .
play with the nuances of human language .
imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud , available for everyone in the cellphone .
four years ago , here at ted , ray kurzweil and i , launched a new university called <unk> university .
we teach these technologies to our students , and in particular , how they can be used to solve the grand challenges of humanity .
and every year , we asked them to launch a company , or a product or service , that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade .
think about that , the fact that a group of students today can touch the life of a billion people .
30 years ago , that would have absurd .
today we can point a <unk> of companies that have already done it .
when i think of creating abundance , it doesn &apos;t mean creating life for every single planet -- it &apos;s about creating a life of the possible .
it &apos;s about taking that which is scarce and making it plentiful .
you see , the scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
it &apos;s a story of napoleon in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> .
the troops of napoleon ate himself with silver , and the same napoleon , covered in gold .
but the king of <unk> , he ate covered in aluminum .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet ; it was worth more than gold and platinum .
that &apos;s why the end of the hong kong is aluminum .
you see , even though aluminum is <unk> percent of the mass of the earth , it doesn &apos;t come as raw metal .
it &apos;s tied up through oxygen and <unk> .
but then the <unk> came and made it so cheap we used it as if it were <unk> .
it <unk> this analogy towards the future .
let &apos;s think about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re on a planet bloated by 5,000 times the energy we use in a year .
they get to the earth 16 <unk> of energy every single day .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , it &apos;s about affordability .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , the cost of solar energy in india is 50 percent less than the production of diesel : <unk> , 17 rupees versus 17 .
the cost of solar fell 50 percent last year .
last month , the mit published a study that shows that at the end of the decade , in the ottoman parts of the united states , the electricity will cost six cents an hour of the national average .
and if we have plenty of energy , we also have plenty of water .
now let &apos;s talk about wars through water .
do you remember when carl sagan pointed the spaceship around earth in 1990 , after saturn happened ?
he took a famous picture . how did he call it ?
&quot; a red dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water .
yes , <unk> percent is seawater , two percent is ice , and we fight for half percent of the earth , but there &apos;s also a hope .
it &apos;s a technology available not 10 or 20 years , but right now .
nanotechnology comes with <unk> .
in a conversation with dean kamen , this morning , one of the innovators in the world -- i &apos;d like to share with you , he gave me permission to do this -- his technology called <unk> <unk> -- he &apos;s about the size of a little refrigerator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water a day from any <unk> source , polluted water , a less than two cents a gallon .
the president of coke has just <unk> that will make an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world .
if that comes right , and i have a full confidence that it will be , coke will globally , globally , globally , global countries .
this is an <unk> innovation by this technology that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen it in mobile phones .
my god , we &apos;re going to get up to 70 percent of the penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013 .
think about it , that t warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of kenya than the president reagan 25 years ago .
and , by having a smartphone with google , it has access to more knowledge and information that the president clinton 15 years ago .
it lives in a world of abundance of information and communication that no one could ever have predicted .
better than that , the things that you and i have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars , armed video , armed images , libraries of books and music , diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and losing market value with mobile phones .
maybe the best thing comes when the applications in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of propaganda with the <unk> foundation something called the x prize <unk> , 10 million dollars .
we &apos;re challenging the equipment in the world to combine these technologies into a mobile device that you &apos;re talking about , and because it has ai , you can get blood out of your finger .
to win it has to make better diagnoses than a certified medical team .
imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent , and there are 1.3 percent of the health workers .
when this device <unk> a rna or dna virus that doesn &apos;t recognize , it will take the area of health and , first of all , <unk> that will happen the pandemic .
but this is the biggest force of producing an abundance world .
i call it the billion in increase .
the white lines here are the population .
we just passed the seven billion mark .
by the way , the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health .
in 2010 , we had less than two billion people online , connected .
by 2020 , it will happen from two billion to five billion users on the internet .
three billion minds never before add that to the global conversation .
what do these people want ?
what would you remember ? what would you want ?
and instead of an economic collapse , we will have the highest economic injection of history .
these people represent tens of billions of dollars living in the global economy .
and more health care , because of the <unk> , a better education with the khan and because of the use of 3d impressions and computation on the cloud will be more productive than ever before .
what can you provide 3,000 billion more members of humanity , healthy , productive ?
how about a voice never before ?
what if we give them to the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time ?
what are these 3,000 billion ?
and what if they are the contributions we can &apos;t predict ?
one thing i learned with the x prize is that small teams , led by their passion with a clear goal , can do extraordinary things -- things that could only do the big teams and the governments .
i &apos;m going to end by sharing a story that really got me excited .
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
it &apos;s called foldit .
it arose at the university of washington , in seattle .
it &apos;s a game in which people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the proteins are printed .
the folding determine the structure and the functionality .
it &apos;s a very important thing in medical research .
and , up until now , it was a supercomputer problem .
they &apos;ve played with this college professors , among each other .
and then hundreds of thousands of people sat down and started playing it .
and it has been shown today that the machinery of human patterns is better to <unk> proteins than the best computers .
and these people looked at the best protein <unk> in the world , and i did not teach at mit , i was not at caltech ; it was a person in england , from manchester , a woman who , during the day , was a executive worker in a rehab clinic , and at night , was the best <unk> of proteins in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in the future is that today we have more power as people to take advantage of the great challenges of the planet .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
we have the passion of <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have 3,000 billion new minds that are focused on working on the solution of big challenges and doing what we should do .
we have in front of us extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change .
and i think this starts with a doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and i &apos;ve spent my time long enough of my fake prestige on that .
before i try my talk , let &apos;s talk a little baseball .
why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , the world <unk> is approaching .
we love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of astonishing statistics .
there are hundreds of statistics .
it &apos;s about &quot; <unk> the rules &quot; ; it talks about statistics and using them to form a great baseball team .
i get into one of them , and i hope many of you know .
it &apos;s called the average <unk> .
and we talk about 300 , about a <unk> that will 300 .
that means that <unk> <unk> effectively , three out of 10 times .
that means throwing the ball into the play field without being caught , and anybody trying to throw it out at the first base , not getting it back in time , and the second base will be thrown away .
three attempts at 10 .
do you know how they call a 300 @-@ fold king cobra ?
well , really good , maybe the equipment of the stars .
you know how they call a four @-@ by @-@ four baseball <unk> ?
by the way , that &apos;s somebody who , 10 hits , gets it four .
legendary -- like the leading ted williams , the last <unk> division i was at running more 400 hits in a regular season .
now i &apos;m going to encourage this to my medicine world where i &apos;m so much more comfortable , or maybe less uncomfortable , after what i &apos;m going to tell you today .
suppose you have <unk> and you &apos;re derivatives of a surgeon who has a four @-@ degree record as well .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
now suppose you live in a remote place and a loved one has two lip <unk> and his family &apos;s doctor leading it to a cardiologist whose record is 200 .
but you know something ?
she &apos;s dramatically improving this year .
and their <unk> have been <unk> .
this is not working .
but i was telling you .
what do you think should be the average of a heart surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon , of a nurse or a 1,000 , very well .
and the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows about a good surgeon , a doctor or a <unk> .
what we do , though , is we <unk> the world , and i am , with the mandate of being perfect .
that never , ever , would make a mistake and make sure how to do it right .
that was the message i attended when i was at medical school .
i was a nerdy student .
once , a fellow in high school said that brian goldman sachs to a blood test .
such a thing .
i studied in my little <unk> , in the doctors &apos; league hospital in toronto , not far from here .
and i learned everything from memory .
from my kind of anatomy , i <unk> the origin and the muscle work , the spin of every artery that comes out of the aorta , the common differential , and the no standard .
and i even knew the difference in how to classify the kidney <unk> .
and as long as we further went further and further knowledge .
and i went very well ; i graduated with <unk> .
and we would learn from the school of medicine with the impression that if we would everything , then it would know everything , or the most possible , closest to everything , because that &apos;s how i got scared of mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met the lady <unk> .
i was assigned to a university hospital here in toronto when they brought the lady into the emergency service where i was working .
at that time , i was assigned to the training of cardiology .
and when i emergencies , requested to go to a cardiologist to go to that patient .
and it tells the chief of residents .
when i saw the lady , i was mesmerized .
i heard a <unk> sound .
and when i rescued her , i heard a sound that was rooted in both sides , which told me a heart failure .
in these conditions , the heart stops working , and instead of placing the blood going forward , the blood goes into the lungs , they get rid of the blood , and that &apos;s why there &apos;s a difficulty breathing .
and it wasn &apos;t hard to diagnose .
i did it and i started working on the treatment i would give it .
i gave him aspirin and medication to address the pressure in his heart .
i gave him cpr , water pills , so he could eliminate liquid .
and in an hour or two , she began to feel better .
and i felt very good .
and that &apos;s when i made the first mistake , i sent her home .
i actually made two more mistakes .
i sent her home without talking to the boss chief .
i didn &apos;t get up the phone , i didn &apos;t do what i should have done , which was i called my boss and <unk> it with him so i looked at it .
and if my boss had seen it , it would have been able to provide the information .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a resident resident resident <unk> that i &apos;d pay attention to .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and capable of taking responsibility , that i could take care of my patients without even reaching my boss .
the second mistake i made was worse .
by sending her home , i wouldn &apos;t pay attention to a voice in my inner world saying , &quot; goldman sachs , it &apos;s not a good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i was so insecure that i even asked the nurse to take care of the grandmother , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay if you &apos;re going to your house ? &quot;
and the nurse thought , and then she said , &quot; yeah , i think it will be ok . &quot;
i remember that as if it was yesterday .
so i posted the high , and the ambulance alongside the ambulance was carried to his house .
and i went back to the hospital room .
the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had a bad <unk> in the stomach .
but i went on with my work .
at the end of the day , i laid down to leave the hospital and i walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home . at that time i did something i don &apos;t normally do .
i went through the guidance service at home .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not what i was taking care of the lady before , but another . she told me three words , those three words that most emergency physicians fear .
other specialists who are afraid of it , but there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> , and that &apos;s what we see the patients <unk> .
the three words are : remember you ?
&quot; remember the patient who sent home ? &quot;
he asked the other nurse with total sadness .
&quot; because she came back , &quot; with the same voice tone .
she was fine .
but he went back and on the edge of death .
at the end of an hour of having come to his house , after i gave him the high , he suffered a collapse and his family called 911 , the ambulance brought into the emergency with a 50 @-@ millimeter pressure , which means severe shock .
i was barely breathing , and i was blue .
the emergency staff will force all their resources .
they gave him medication to get up the blood pressure .
and they put an artificial <unk> .
i was mesmerized and <unk> it up to the marrow .
he had a mix of feelings because after he had been in intensive care , and i was hoping against all the hope that he was facing .
and within the two or three days , it was apparent that i would never meet .
he had an injured brain damage .
the family gathered together .
and in eight or nine days , he was equivalent to what was happening .
and at the ninth day , they let her go . the lady <unk> , wife and grandmother .
they say they never forget the names they die .
that was my first experience .
the next weeks , i became passionate about it , and i experienced the shame that exists in our medical culture , and i felt alone , isolated , without feeling that healthy shame because you can &apos;t relate to your colleagues .
you know , you know that health state when you let the best friend write a secret to hold , and you discover it . so your friend faces it and you have a terrible discussion , but at the end of that , that unpleasant feeling is his signature and you can admit that he never <unk> that error .
you make the peace and you never make that mistake .
it &apos;s that shame left a teaching .
the shame in which i &apos;m talking about is the one who makes us feel very bad inside .
it &apos;s the one who tells us not that what we did was wrong , but we &apos;re bad .
and that felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my boss ; he was a <unk> .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he ate things and he made sure i don &apos;t get tired .
and i kept getting those questions .
why don &apos;t i ask my boss ? why did i send her home ?
and in my worst moments , why did i make such a dumb error ?
why did i choose medicine ?
soon to that feeling , he was paralyzed .
and i started feeling better .
and on a rainy day , the sky opened and finally the sun came out , and i wondered if i &apos;d feel better again .
and i did a deal with myself in which if i did the efforts to be perfect to make no mistakes , i would cheat those voices .
and it did .
i went back to work .
but it came back again .
two years later , i was led to the emergency department in a community hospital north in toronto , and i got a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man with a pain in her throat .
i was very busy .
and he <unk> here .
i looked at his throat , he was a little stubborn .
i sent him penicillin and i sent him home .
but while he was heading to the door , he kept pointing his throat .
two days later , when i came to make my name shift , my boss asked me to talk to me on his office .
and he made the three words : remember you ?
do you remember the patient who saw in the pain of the throat ?
he came back and he had no <unk> <unk> .
he had a potentially fatal condition called <unk> .
you can look at google . it &apos;s an infection , not the throat , but from the upper air , and it can cause the closing of those roads .
he , thankfully , did not die .
he <unk> antibiotics through <unk> , and he recovered at the few days .
and i took the same period of shame and accountability , and then i went back to work , until it happened over and over again , and again .
twice in the same nursing turn , they &apos;re not saving each other .
and it &apos;s a great effort , especially working in a hospital , because it &apos;s 14 patients at the same time .
but in both cases , i haven &apos;t sent them home and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s been a <unk> .
one of them thought i had a kidney calculation .
he downloaded an x @-@ ray of kidneys , but he found himself , a colleague that was tracking the patient by a certain sensitivity in the lower right quadrant and called the surgeon .
the other patient was with a lot of diarrhea .
i <unk> her liquid for <unk> , and i asked my colleague to kill her .
he checked it and he noticed a certain sensitivity in the lower right quadrant called the surgeon .
both of them were operated and they recovered well .
but every case , i <unk> myself .
but i &apos;d like to tell you that i made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise , and as many colleagues say , it &apos;s a mess .
the most significant have been over the last five years .
only , shame and no support .
and here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t go and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the <unk> that tell me what &apos;s really happening , how can i share this with my colleagues ?
how do i teach them this so that they don &apos;t make the same mistakes ?
if i now entered a place like this , i would have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you listened to somebody talk about failure , after failure , after failure ?
of course , at a cocktail party you &apos;ll hear about the mistakes of other doctors , but you won &apos;t hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
if i could now go into a room full of colleagues , if i wanted to support them and tell you what i just told you about you , i wouldn &apos;t have come to the second story without you started <unk> , somebody would make a joke , they would change the topic and they would follow .
and if i knew and my colleagues too , that a <unk> in my hospital poisoned the wrong leg , believe that i would have difficulty looking at it in my eyes .
this is the system we have .
complete denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s the system in which there are two positions : those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t -- who can &apos;t sleep and those who can do ; those who have a lousy outcome and those who have great outcomes .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like antibodies that begin to attack that person .
we have the idea that if you step out of medicine to people who make mistakes , you will remain a safe system .
but that brings two problems .
in 20 years , approximately as a spread and medical journalism , i have done a public study of medical assistance and medical mistakes to learn how possible , from the first article i wrote for the star trek to my show , &quot; black <unk> , art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous .
we work in a system where mistakes happen every day , in which one out of 10 <unk> drugs in the hospital are wrong , or <unk> is not right . in a system where hiv infections are increasingly , and more numerous , causing chaos and death .
in this country , 24 @-@ karat doctors killed .
the u.s. medical institute set up 100,000 .
in both cases , it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re not <unk> the problem as we should .
and so there are things .
a <unk> system where knowledge multiplied every two or three years , and we wouldn &apos;t be energized .
sleep deprivation .
and we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have cognitive biases that enable a perfect record of a patient with pain in the chest .
now , let &apos;s take the same patient with a pain in the chest , comes with <unk> eyes and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden , my story <unk> .
it &apos;s not the same story .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things always .
and my patients are not cars . they don &apos;t always hear their symptoms in the same way .
all over this , mistakes are inevitable .
so , if we take the system as we were taught , and we removed all the stakeholders of error , well , there won &apos;t be anyone left .
and how about people don &apos;t want to talk about their most serious cases ?
in my show , &quot; <unk> black , black art , no longer to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; i would say to all of you , from the ambulance to the head of cardiac surgery : &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , &quot; what are your mistakes ? and we &apos;re going to them . &quot;
and his students were paralyzed , <unk> , <unk> his head and <unk> saliva and <unk> to tell his stories .
they want to tell their stories , they want to share them .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake . &quot;
they need a context where they can do it .
they need an <unk> medical culture .
and it starts with a physician every time .
<unk> <unk> is human , you know , you know , you accept it , and you don &apos;t know how to mistakes , but you try to learn from what &apos;s happened to teach others .
they share their experiences with them .
it &apos;s support for those who talk about their mistakes .
points out the mistakes of other people , not with the intention of <unk> , but in a way of loving and caring for everyone to get sick .
and it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are running the system , and when this happens , they make mistakes rather than when .
but the system is evolving to create <unk> that will allow us to detect in a simple way those mistakes that inevitably make humans , and also promote the support and the love , the spaces where we look at the health care system , can detect potential mistakes and be rewarded by that , especially people like me , to make mistakes being <unk> for us .
my name is brian goldman sachs .
i &apos;m a <unk> doctor .
i am human , making mistakes .
and i &apos;m so sorry , but i &apos;m trying to learn something that can transmit others .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three personal words : i remember it .
i &apos;m going to talk about a very small idea .
the dawn <unk> .
and as the idea can be explained in a minute , i &apos;ll give you three examples to make time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
he was here , as you know , in <unk> .
you may think it was <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t .
he actually would take fish .
and he described one of them as very common .
it was the <unk> .
they dressed it very much up to the 1880s .
now the fish is in the red list in the fence .
but we &apos;ve heard this story many times , about galapagos and other places , so that doesn &apos;t have anything special .
but the case is that we still come to the galapagos .
we still think of them being <unk> .
the <unk> still say they &apos;re still intact .
so what happens here ?
the second story , again , shows another concept : the shifting of the waist .
because i was there in 1971 studying a lagoon in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa .
i thought i could get you .
i was very upset about the sun , and i was convinced that i wasn &apos;t there .
this is my first exposure to the sun .
the lagoon was surrounded by <unk> , and as you can see , of a mangroves .
there were about 20 centimeters , black beard <unk> .
and the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and passed by a good time , so it got more than half in ghana .
when i was there 27 years later , the number of fish had fallen in the middle .
i went to five centimeters .
they experimented with genetic pressure .
there were still fish .
in a way , they were still happy .
and the fish were still happy to be there .
i mean , nothing to change , but everything has changed .
my third story is that i was complicit in the introduction of fishing in southeast asia .
in the 1970s , well , it started in europe &apos;s <unk> by doing a lot of development projects .
development <unk> group in which have 100,000 fishermen already had , preserving the industrial fisheries .
and this boat , rather ugly , was called &quot; 4 a.m. &quot;
i went out and fishing in it , and we did studies in the south china sea , and above all , in chengdu .
what we capture there was something <unk> .
we capture , now i know , sea floor .
90 percent of what we capture were , other animals that are in the background .
and most fishes , most of the fishes , are blobs of these things that are coral reefs .
in summary , the bottom of the sea came on the deck and then it was <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is so fast .
in one year , you do a studio and then you start commercial fishing .
the background goes from being a solid coral deep ground , in this case , to be a <unk> .
this is a dead tortoise .
they didn &apos;t eat them . they were <unk> because they were dead .
we once capture a living .
i wasn &apos;t dismayed yet .
so they wanted to hire me because it was a good food .
this mountain of remains what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they never have any seafood .
but it &apos;s not recorded .
we turn the world , but we don &apos;t remember .
he hung up on , on the new level , without remembering what he was there .
if you look at this , something like this .
on the axis , and we have good things : biodiversity , the number of killer whales , the <unk> of the country , the water supply .
and that changes over time . it changes because people make things <unk> .
every generation who are using images given up at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and empowered them forward .
the difference is that they perceive loss .
but they don &apos;t perceive the loss that happened before .
you can look at the line of change .
and by the end of keeping a few <unk> out .
and that , largely , is what we want to do now .
we want to keep things that are no longer , or they &apos;re not what they were .
but you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies kill animals without knowing what they &apos;ve done to a few generations later .
because , of course , an animal that &apos;s very rich , before they go extinct , is unusual .
you don &apos;t lose plentiful animals .
you lose similar animals .
even if this doesn &apos;t feel like a big loss .
over time , we focus on big animals , and in a sea , we offer fish fish .
they become unusual because the <unk> .
over time , there are few fishes , but we think that &apos;s the starting point .
and the question is , why do we accept this ?
well , because we don &apos;t know it was different .
in fact , a lot of people , scientists , who were very different .
and they will do it because the evidence introduced in an earlier way is not the way they would expect evidence to be .
for example , the story that a number of people show , like a <unk> and just looked at a lot of fish in this area can &apos;t be used , and typically they don &apos;t use fishing scientists , because it &apos;s not rocket science .
so , we have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in controversial societies , because they don &apos;t rely on the sources of the past .
from there the enormous paper that can deliver a protected ocean area .
because with marine protected zones , we actually visualize the past .
we &apos;re creating the past that people can &apos;t conceive of , because the starting point has gone down and is incredibly low .
that &apos;s for people who can see a protected ocean area and can benefit from vision that provides , which allows them to delete their starting point .
and what about people who can &apos;t do it because they don &apos;t have access , like middle eastern middle eastern people , for example ?
i think the arts and film can probably fill the vacuum . the simulation .
this is a simulation of the chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were gray whales in chesapeake bay , 500 years ago .
and you may have noticed that the nuances and the <unk> are like &quot; avatar &quot; .
and if you think about &quot; in , &quot; if you think about why people were moved with the film , let &apos;s talk about the story of <unk> , why would you interact with images ?
because they evoke something that , in some sense , has gone missing .
so my suggestion , the only one i &apos;m going to give you is cameron , avatar , under the water .
thank you very much .
in the &apos; 80s , in the eastern germany , if you had a typewriter of writing , you had to face the government .
i had to register a text sheet for example written with the machine .
and this so that the government could track the origin of the texts .
if they found a written with the wrong message , they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea .
in the west , we don &apos;t think that somebody could do this , how much this would be freedom of expression .
we would never do that in our countries .
but today , in 2011 , if you buy a laser color printer of any big manufacturer and it prints a page , that page will end up having some yellow dots on every page that actually follow a pattern that makes them from one and its printer .
that &apos;s happening today .
and no one looks very <unk> about this .
this is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us , the citizens .
and it &apos;s one of the three main causes of problems in the network .
if we see what happens in the online world , we can put together the attacks according to their attackers .
there are three main groups .
there are <unk> .
like mr. <unk> of the city of <unk> , in ukraine .
the <unk> cell is very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use cyber weapons to make a lot of money , enormous amounts .
there are actually many cases of <unk> @-@ million @-@ dollar , which will save money with their attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> , of estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
this is stephen hanson .
this is yuyu <unk> .
these are matthieu anderson , <unk> al @-@ <unk> etc . , etc . , etc .
these guys are doing their <unk> online , but they &apos;re doing it through illegal media using <unk> to steal money from our bank accounts when we buy online , or steal our key to get information from our boards when we buy an infected computer .
the secret service of america , two months ago , i witnessed the swiss account of this fellow , sam jain , and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain <unk> ; his <unk> is over .
and i say today , more likely than any of us is to be a victim of a real crime .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this goes from wrong .
in the future , most crime will occur .
the second group of bombers in importance that we see today is not driven by the money .
there &apos;s one other thing that makes them move , they motivate their protest , they motivate their opinions , they motivate them all around .
groups like <unk> have <unk> in the last 12 months in a leading role in online attacks .
those are the three leading bombers , the criminals who make it for money , the <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and the last group are the national states that attack .
and then we see cases like <unk> .
that &apos;s a good example of government attack against its own citizens .
sharmeen is actually a <unk> of the netherlands , or actually he was .
he declared the last fall because of a <unk> .
we monitored the security of the site and <unk> a <unk> .
last week i asked , at a meeting with dutch government mps , i asked one of the leaders if they saw the death of people due to epileptic seizure .
and the answer of him was yes .
so how do people die because of an attack of these ?
<unk> is an <unk> authority .
they sell a certificate .
what are the players for ?
well , you need if you have a website with <unk> , services like <unk> , services like <unk> .
now , all of us , or almost all of us , use some of your competitors , but these services are very popular in <unk> states like iran who are using foreign services like &quot; because they know that they are more reliable than local services , and they &apos;re <unk> in connections so that the local government can &apos;t <unk> their discussions .
unless you translate a foreign authority .
and they were <unk> certified .
and in the case of <unk> , exactly that happened .
and what happened in the arab spring and those things that have happened , for example , in egypt ?
well , in egypt , in egypt , the head of the evil police in april , 2011 and during the building <unk> , they found many papers .
amongst those papers was this folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and within that folder , there were notes of a company based on germany that had sold the egyptian governance to intercept large scale the communications of the citizens of the country .
they &apos;d sold this tool for 75,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company &apos;s seat is right here .
i mean , western governments provide tools for governments to do this to their citizens .
but the western governments also do this themselves .
for example , in germany , only a couple of weeks ago , he found the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- a german government <unk> used to investigate its own citizens .
if you are suspect in a good criminal case , it &apos;s pretty obvious that your phone is <unk> .
but today it goes further .
the internet connection was assigned .
they use even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with an <unk> to enable them to see all the communication , and listen to online discussions , to get our data .
when we think about things like this , the obvious answer should be , &quot; well , it looks bad , but it doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m an honest citizen .
why worry ?
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s in the game of privacy .
privacy is not in dispute .
it &apos;s not a question of privacy against security .
it &apos;s about freedom versus control .
even though we could rely on our governments today in 2011 , any right that we have today , will always be .
in any future government , in a administration that we could have within 50 years ?
these are the questions that we worry about the next 50 years .
this may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
the first concrete blocks were constructed in <unk> with a very simple idea : cement modules of a fixed that fit between itself .
very quickly , these became the most efficient construction unit in the world .
they have allowed us to build bigger things than us , like buildings and bridges , a wind at a time .
essentially , these blocks have become the building blocks of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , to 70,000 people came up with this .
he called it the machine assembly .
and within a few years , the building blocks of <unk> came to every house .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges , buildings or homes .
lego made it accessible .
lego simply adopted the concrete block , the favorite in the world , and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination .
meanwhile , exactly that same year in bell , the next revolution was about to quote : the new building block .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of bricks , with each other to a world where everything was interactive .
just like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex , a wind at once .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept , that the building blocks of our time are reserved experts , so i decided to call it .
eight years ago , when i was in the media lab , i began to explore the idea of using the power of engineers at the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
i &apos;ll show you how they work .
<unk> are <unk> each with a specific function .
they &apos;re wired to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
and the best of all , they join together through magnets .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
the bricks have a code of colors .
the green is the output , the blue is the stream , the rose and the orange one is the wire .
so you only have to assemble a blue with a green one and very quickly begin to make bigger circuitry .
a green one with a green one makes light .
we can put a button in the middle , and we &apos;ve got a stuffed .
if we change the button on a pulse module , which is here , and now we have a light bulb .
we add this doorbell to create more impact and we have a noise machine .
i &apos;ll stop this .
so beyond the simple game , <unk> are actually very powerful .
instead of having to program , connect and link it , it allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
to make it faster or slower , it simply rolls this button that makes the pulse be faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing collection .
we want all the interactions in the world to be distributed to bricks ready to use .
lights , sound , solar panels ; everything must be accessible .
we &apos;ve given kids to play with them .
and it has been an incredible experience .
the best part is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don &apos;t learn in schools .
for example , how a light works at night , or why an escalator is open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also taken <unk> to design schools .
so , for example , designers without any experience in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material .
here you can see , with paper bottles and stack it up , we have <unk> it .
a few weeks ago , we took care of the designers at rhode island school of design , which have no experience in engineering , we took on cardboard , wood and we said , &quot; do something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that you &apos;ve done , a <unk> by motion .
but wait , here comes my favorite project .
it &apos;s a locust made by a play @-@ dough that has a fear of darkness .
for these non @-@ engineers , <unk> became another material , the electronics became another material .
and we want this material to be in the grasp of everyone .
so , <unk> has open source .
you can visit the website , you can download all the design files and throw it away .
we want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators because this world we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so go ahead and invent .
thank you .
