one day in the los angeles <unk> steve times was walking down the streets of downtown los angeles when he heard a beautiful music .
she came from a man , a lovely , goofy man , hard @-@ face , hard @-@ home face , playing a violin that only had two strings .
i &apos;m telling you a story that many of you know , because steven &apos;s column was the basis for a book that then became a film , with robert <unk> , who operates as steve <unk> and jamie <unk> , the trained <unk> in <unk> whose promising career was <unk> by a tragic <unk> of schizophrenia .
nathaniel quit <unk> , he suffered a total and 30 years later he was living on the streets of skid row at the center of los angeles .
i encourage you to read steve or look at the movie to understand not only the beautiful link that was created between these two men , but how music helped to shape that link , and finally played a critical role to help nathaniel out the streets .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago in the walt disney hall .
he had just heard an interpretation of the first and fourth symphony of beethoven and came behind the stage to present .
he spoke in a very <unk> and social way about me @-@ yo ma and hillary hillary clinton and how the novel would never get to the world series , all because of the <unk> of the first violin of the last beethoven movement .
and we talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email from steve saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , i should mention that nathaniel is denied by treatment , because when he was treated by <unk> shock therapy , <unk> and wives , and that scar has remained in his entire life .
but as a result now , it &apos;s prone to these schizophrenics , and the worst <unk> can be <unk> with him exploding and then disappearing for days , <unk> by the streets of skid row , exposed to his <unk> , with the <unk> of his own mind without control .
and nathaniel was in such a state of turbulence when we started our first lesson in the walt disney hall who had a kind of flash <unk> in his eyes , he was lost .
and he talked about the unseen and the smoke , and how someone was sleeping it .
and i felt fear , not for me , but fear that i was going to lose it , that i was going to sink in one of his states and that i would discuss his relationship with the violin if i started talking about scales and <unk> and other exciting ways of pedagogy .
so i just started playing .
and i touched the first movement of beethoven &apos;s violin .
and as i touched , i learned that a profound change was happening in nathaniel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if i was under control of some invisible drugs , a chemical reaction , for which i played music was its catalyst .
and cholera that was transformed into understanding , in a sit curiosity and in grace .
and as a miracle , he raised his own violin , and he began to touch some clips of concerts for violin , which then asked me to join , relaxed , relaxed , relaxed .
and we started talking about music , from bach up until beethoven and brahms , <unk> , all of the <unk> , all the way down to that <unk> @-@ <unk> .
and i understood that he had not only a <unk> knowledge of music , but he was <unk> with this music at a personal level .
he talked about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic .
and through playing music and talking about music , this man became transformed from the paranoid man who had come from walking the streets of the center of los angeles to the very lovely , scholar , brilliant , high @-@ educated musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and his delusions and turn through his imagination and his creativity actually .
and this is an escape from his <unk> state .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the real reason why we make music , that we took something that exists within all of us , in our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we are able to transform those emotions in reality .
and the reality of that expression hits us all , moves us , inspire us and binds us .
and for nathaniel , the music brought him back to the group of friends .
the <unk> power of music went back to the family of musicians who understood it , who recognized their talents and respected .
and i always will make music with nathaniel , whether we &apos;re in the walt disney hall , or on skid row , because he reminds me of why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that without some embarrassment <unk> of the <unk> .
so please excuse me .
so i &apos;ve met a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve only loved two .
the first was more like a passionate romance .
it was a beautiful , tasty fish , with texture , <unk> , a <unk> in the menu .
fish fish .
even better , he was raised with the highest <unk> of sustainability .
so you could feel good at selling .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , he called the head of the company , and he asked if i would talk at an event about sustainability <unk> .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve this problem for our chefs that had been a tornado unimaginable tornado , and we had fish in our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we fishing in the shallow seas in the same way as harvesting our forests .
it &apos;s hard to get rid of destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the salmon , the <unk> fish , all collapsed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for good or for bad , <unk> , fish parenting , will be part of our future .
there are lots of arguments against . fish <unk> , at least most of them do , and they &apos;re inefficient , let &apos;s take the example of tuna . a major disadvantage .
it has a 15 @-@ to @-@ one food conversion rate .
this means that you need 15 pounds of wild fish to generate one kilogram of bluefin tuna .
it &apos;s not very sustainable .
it &apos;s not very tasty either .
so here , finally , there was a company trying to do the right thing .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the pr superintendent of the company .
<unk> don .
&quot; gift , &quot; i said , &quot; only to have the facts clear , you are famous for raising so far too far sea inside , not contaminate . &quot;
he said , &quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far away , that the waste of our fish distribute , they don &apos;t concentrate . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world in itself .
that food conversion rate ? 2.5 to one , &quot; said .
&quot; best in the <unk> . &quot;
2.5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.5 to one ? what are they feeding them ? &quot;
<unk> protein , he said to me .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . and i put the phone down .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , right before the event , i called it don <unk> .
i said , &quot; sir , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he told me he didn &apos;t know . i &apos;d say over there .
well , i spoke on the phone with some people in the company . nobody could give me a direct answer , until i finally spoke on the phone with the <unk> in charge .
let &apos;s call it don .
&quot; gift , &quot; i said , &quot; what are examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some fish food , and then he said chicken <unk> .
i said , &quot; chicken wings ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , bone , remains , <unk> and processed in food . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of the food is chicken ? &quot;
thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you have sustainable <unk> to feed the fish ? &quot;
there was a long silence in the line , and he said , &quot; that &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i am glad to this fish .
no , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s some gourmet <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m actually .
no , i really struggled with this fish , because , i swear to god , that after that conversation , the fish had a taste of chicken .
the second fish , it &apos;s another kind of love story .
the romantic guy , the guy you know the fish , the more you love fish .
i ate it for the first time in a restaurant in southern spain .
a friend of mine was talking about this fish for a long time .
somehow she organized our first quote .
he came to the table of a white color , of course , and almost <unk> .
the chef had been on fire .
type twice as much .
incredibly , it was just delicious .
can you make a fish the same as rich after being so <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
call him michelangelo . actually his name is <unk> michelangelo .
and no , he doesn &apos;t value fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least in the way we understand it and i .
it &apos;s a biologist running the palm .
it &apos;s a fish <unk> on the <unk> @-@ west edge of spain .
it &apos;s at the tip of the river <unk> .
until the 1980s , the <unk> was in the <unk> &apos;s hands .
it also raised cows on what was essentially <unk> .
they managed to <unk> the ground .
they built this series of canals , and confined water on the ground to the river .
well , they didn &apos;t make it work , they didn &apos;t make it work .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed something like 90 percent of the birds , which for a place like this , are many birds .
and then in 1982 , a spanish company with an environmental awareness buying the soil .
what did they do ?
they inverted the flows of water .
it literally <unk> the switch .
instead of pushing water out , used the canals to attract water into .
we channel channels .
they created a <unk> of pack @-@ acre fish -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , shrimp , <unk> -- and in the process , michelangelo and his company completely <unk> the ecological destruction .
<unk> is amazing .
i mean , they never saw something like this .
you look at the horizon that &apos;s about a million miles away , and you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s flooded with <unk> channels and this <unk> and rich swamp .
i was there not a long time ago with michelangelo .
it &apos;s an amazing guy , three charles darwin and a <unk> crocodile .
ok ? so , here we are <unk> by the swamp , and i &apos;m <unk> and <unk> with mud at the knees , and michelangelo is doing with a biology conference .
here &apos;s a black <unk> <unk> <unk> .
now , he is facing the need of minerals .
and here , here he is looking at a pattern of clustering that makes him remind the <unk> of tanzania .
turns out that michelangelo spent most of his career in <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how he became a fish expert .
he said , &quot; <unk> ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert on relations . &quot;
and then he starts talking again about strange birds and algae and strange plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community disconnected from that kind of thing .
it &apos;s fantastic , but i was in love .
and my head was bathed in that piece of delicious fish .
so i called it . i said , &quot; michelangelo , makes your fish so beautiful ? &quot;
he showed me the algae .
&quot; i know , <unk> , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , it &apos;s amazing .
but , you &apos;re eating your fish ?
what is the food conversion index ? &quot;
well , he starts telling me it &apos;s such a rich system , that fish are eating what they would eat in their natural <unk> .
the biomass of plants , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , is what feeds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s fully self @-@ renewable .
there &apos;s no food .
have you heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals ?
later that day , i was driving with michelangelo around a property , and i asked her , &quot; i said , &quot; to a place which seems so natural , &quot; different than any <unk> i &apos;ve been visited , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that time , it was as if a movie director asked to change the stage .
and by bending in the corner , we saw the most incredible landscape , thousands and thousands of pink <unk> , literally a pink carpet up to the horizon .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at his <unk> , pink .
they &apos;re doing a <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , you &apos;re not doing a fish with your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he told me .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eggs in the birds . <unk>
well , last year , this property had 600,000 <unk> over 250 different species .
it became today the largest , and one of the most important bird <unk> all over europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; michelangelo , a population of thriving birds is not the last thing you would like to have in your fish <unk> ? &quot;
it moved your head , &quot; no . &quot;
he said , &quot; we are in a hurry , not intensive .
this is an ecological network .
shrimp are eaten by shrimp .
shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the more pink you have the womb is the system . &quot;
okay , <unk> . a <unk> who doesn &apos;t feed their animals , and a <unk> that measures their success in the health of their predators .
a fish <unk> , but also a bird sanctuary .
oh , and by the way , those <unk> , first of all , shouldn &apos;t be there .
<unk> in a village that remains to 1,500 miles in which the ground conditions are better at making nests .
every morning , they fly 150 miles up to <unk> .
and every afternoon , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they get the white <unk> line on the highway .
i &apos;m not kidding .
i was imagining a kind of penguin march , so i looked at him to michelangelo .
i said , &quot; michelangelo , fly 150 miles to the <unk> , and then they fly 150 miles back to night ?
do you make that for your pups ? &quot;
he looked at me as if he had just quoted a song from houston whitney .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t even like the fish skin . i don &apos;t like to shave . i don &apos;t like to shave .
that &apos;s <unk> taste , like tar .
i almost never use it to cook .
however , when i photographed her in that restaurant in southern spain , i had nothing comfortable with fish skin .
he had a sweet , clean taste , as if you were eating a <unk> of the ocean .
i mentioned that to michelangelo and <unk> with his head .
he said , &quot; the skin <unk> like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something between the body .
it evolved to absorb <unk> . &quot;
and then he said , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
ok . a fish that doesn &apos;t feed their fish , a <unk> that measures their success for the success of their predators .
and then i realized when he says , a <unk> that has no <unk> , made a huge understatement , because the water flowing through that freezing river comes from the <unk> river .
it &apos;s a river that <unk> all the things that rivers tend to consume today , chemical pollutants , pesticide <unk> .
and when they &apos;re entering the system and they go , the water is more clean than when they entered .
the system is so healthy to water .
so , not only a <unk> that does not feed their animals , not just a <unk> that measures their success for their predators , but a <unk> that is literally a water <unk> plant , and not only for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take it , and you should also take it , because this love story , although romantic , is also education .
you might say it &apos;s a recipe for the future of food , that we &apos;re talking about brussels or beef .
what we need now is a radically different conception of agriculture , in which food is actually tasty .
but for many people , that &apos;s too radical .
we are not realistic ; we are lovers .
we love farmers &apos; markets . we love small family farms ; we talk about local food ; we eat organic .
and when it suggests that these are the things that the future of good food , someone else will say , &quot; hey , <unk> , i love pink , but you &apos;re going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , it &apos;s not because we already produce calories from food to feed the world .
one billion people will be hungry today .
one billion -- more than ever before in history -- because of big inequities in the distribution , not <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it has determined the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feeding grain to herbivores , pesticides , chemicals on the ground , chicken to the fish , and all the way around , the <unk> has just asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people in a cheaper way , how terrible it can be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motivation . it &apos;s been the <unk> . it &apos;s been the american business plan .
we should call it what it really is , a business in <unk> , a business that is rapidly <unk> the ecological capital that makes its own production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our bread basket is being threatened today , not by a decrease of supplies , but by a resource decline .
not the last invention of tractors , but for the fertile soil , not for bombs , but for fresh water , not for <unk> , but by forest and not for ships and fishing nets , but by fish in the sea .
do you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better . how can we create conditions that allow every community to feed itself ?
to do this , don &apos;t look at the model of future <unk> .
it &apos;s really old and exhausted .
it &apos;s <unk> in capital , chemistry , and machinery , and it &apos;s never really rich to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
it &apos;s the one that &apos;s based on two billion real years of working experience .
look at michelangelo , farmers like michelangelo .
<unk> that are not a world that is locked away in itself , i would argue that it is occasionally <unk> , that they are growing in a purely critical way , farmers who are not only producers , but expertise in relationships .
because they are the ones that are also taste experts .
and i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re better chef than i &apos;ll never be .
you know , i have no problem with that , because if that &apos;s the future of food , it &apos;s going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i can leave you this day with one big idea , it &apos;s that the data cluster that we consume is bigger than the sum of the parts , and instead of looking at it as an information overload , what i want you to think about is how we can use that information to try and see trends in another invisible way .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical sheet of mortality organized by age .
this tool i use is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and with <unk> what i can do is filter a particular cause of deaths , say accidents .
and immediately we see a different pattern .
this is because , in the central section here , people are their most active stage , and here they are in the most fragile .
we can go back and repeat the data because of death , looking at disease and cancer are the usual suspects , even though not for all .
if we take age , say under 40 , we see that accidents are really the main cause of people to worry .
and if you get more involved in that , it &apos;s more common in the case of men .
so they understand the idea that looking at information and data in this way , it &apos;s like swimming in a living data <unk> .
and if we can do this with data , raw data , why don &apos;t we also do it for content ?
so what we have here , is the cover of all the titles that have been produced .
this is all over here . on the web .
they can go back to their rooms and try this after my talk .
<unk> can reduce it to a decade .
or reduce it to a particular year .
or you can directly jump into a particular issue .
so i &apos;m looking at this , i see athletes that have appeared in this issue , sports .
i &apos;m a fan of lance armstrong , so i &apos;m going to give him a click of that , which reveals me , all the <unk> in which he is lance .
now if you just want to take a look at this , we could think , &quot; what if we look at everything related to cycling ? &quot;
so i can go back and scale that .
and now i see greg <unk> .
so you have an idea that when you measure information in this way , by <unk> , by expanding , by <unk> , you &apos;re not looking , you &apos;re not sailing .
they &apos;re doing something slightly different .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information takes .
so i want to convey a little bit of this idea , which is kind of crazy .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve taken all the pages of wikipedia and we &apos;ve brought them down to a little summary .
the summary is a little <unk> and an icon that indicates the area of <unk> that comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the 500 popular pages of wikipedia .
but even in this limited view , we can do many things .
immediately , we can have a sense of the most popular wikipedia <unk> .
i &apos;m going to encourage you to select government .
now , having selected government , i can see that the wikipedia categories most frequently correspond to that are the time of the year .
this is really important because this reveals something that was not content on any wikipedia page .
you can only take that look when you step back and see everything .
so , looking at one of these particular gallery , i can then drill down into the concept of time <unk> magazine , and look at them all .
so looking at these people , i can see that most of them come from government . some of them come from natural science . a few , they come from the business world . there &apos;s my boss , and one of them comes from music .
and most interest , bono is also a winner of the ted prize .
so we can jump and take a look at all the ted prize winners .
as you see , we &apos;re browsing the web for the first time as if it &apos;s really a network , not a page , but at a larger level of abstraction .
i want to show you one more thing i can probably get a little bit better .
i &apos;m just showing here the new york times <unk> .
and lo and behold , this tool -- i don &apos;t want a web browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see pages with it -- and we bring the information technology approach to every website like this .
i can return , i can give a back to a specific section .
now , the reason why it &apos;s important is because , by the simple fact of looking at pages of the web , i can see my full self @-@ replicating record records in the same way .
and i can go into what i &apos;ve done in specific time periods .
here , in fact , the state of all the demonstration that i just gave .
and i can do a reproduction of some of the things i saw this morning .
and if i want to go back and see it all , i can take you and cut my record , maybe by the search history . here , i was doing a little bit of <unk> search , looking for <unk> , over here in the <unk> labs .
and from here i can go to the website and make it again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that has a new purpose every time , and in every case it makes the sum bigger than the sum of its parts with the data .
so now , in this world , we think of data as a curse .
we talk about the information overload curse .
we talk about <unk> in data .
what if we turn this around and put our heads on the web , so instead of going from one thing to the next , we get excited about the habit of being able to go from lots of things , and then being able to see the patterns that would otherwise be hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being stuck in data , we can actually extract information .
and if , instead of just dealing with information , we can gather knowledge .
and if we have knowledge , then maybe we can find wisdom .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up with a science fiction diet .
in the institute , a bus to school of an hour &apos;s journey every day .
and i was always involved in a book , a science fiction book , which <unk> my mind to other worlds , and crucially , in an insatiable narrative , the sense of curiosity i had .
and , you know , curiosity also <unk> itself in the sense that as long as it wasn &apos;t in school , it was in the forest , doing <unk> and taking samples , snakes , bugs , bugs and ponds , looking through the microscope .
you know , i was a real science fan .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the boundaries of the possibility .
and my love for science fiction was reflected in the world around me , all around what was happening , at the end of the &apos; 60s , <unk> the moon , <unk> the deep oceans .
jacques cousteau came to our room with his incredible special special rooms where he taught us animals and places and a wonderful world that we could never have imagined before .
so , that sounded like the science fiction part .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i discovered that , because there were no video games or this computer @-@ made film saturation or all this media landscape , i had to create images in my head .
we all made them , as kids who have to read a book , through the description of the author , we put something on the movie screens of our heads .
so , my answer to this was painting , drawing aliens and their worlds , spaceship , spaceship , all that .
i was infinitely present in the mathematics class behind the notebook .
that was the creativity that had to come out somehow .
and an interesting thing happened , the jacques <unk> show actually <unk> me about that there was a world that was laid out right here on earth .
i could probably not go to an alien world on a spaceship some day . that seemed quite unlikely .
but that was a world that could actually go , right here on the earth , which was so alive and as exotic as anything you could have imagined by reading one of those books .
so , i decided i was going to turn myself into a diver at age 15 .
although the only problem about that was that he lived in a canadian <unk> , 600 miles from the nearest ocean .
i didn &apos;t let that leave me alone .
i gave the can to my father until he finally discovered a kind of diving in buffalo , new york , just crossing the border that we lived in .
so , i was sitting in a swimming pool in a <unk> in the middle of winter in buffalo , new york .
and i didn &apos;t come to see an ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the last 40 years , i &apos;ve been about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 of them in submersibles .
and i &apos;ve learned that that habitat from the deep ocean and even the least profound , are so rich from an incredible life that really exceeds the imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so <unk> compared to our weak human imagination .
still today , i &apos;m still totally unaware of what i &apos;ve seen when i do these <unk> .
and my romance with the ocean continues , and just as strong as it was always .
although i chose a profession , as an adult , it was the director .
and it seemed to be the best way to reconcile those , wanting to tell stories , with the willingness to create images .
and i was , as a child , constantly drawing comics and so forth .
so , making films was a way of putting images and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories we were telling were stories of science fiction : &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
and with &quot; the <unk> , &quot; i brought my love from being underwater and diving , making films .
combining the two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; which served to solve a particular problem of storytelling in the movie , which was to create a type of liquid water creature , so we embrace computer animation , rendering it up .
and it turned out to be the first surface characters made by computer that has never been done in a movie .
and even though the film wasn &apos;t too profitable , pretty much profits and losses , i should say i witnessed something amazing , which was the audience , the world audience , was devastated by this apparent magic .
it &apos;s like arthur clarke &apos;s law saying that any advanced technology can &apos;t distinguish magic .
they saw something magical .
so that made me really depressed .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be adapted to <unk> art . &quot;
so &quot; 2 terminator , &quot; my next movie , we took this much more <unk> .
working with <unk> , we created the liquid metal uncle in that movie , the <unk> was actually going to work .
and it worked . and we created magic again , and we had the same public outcome , even though we took something more money out of it .
so , drawing a line through those two points of experience , we came to , this was going to be a new world , this was a whole new world of creativity for <unk> artists .
so , he believes a company with stan winston , my good friend stan , who is the main <unk> and <unk> designer of the moment , and we call it digital <unk> .
and the goal of the company was that you would have a leap above all the optical <unk> processes , etc . , and you would row straight into digital production .
and we actually did , and we got a competitive advantage for a while .
we were left behind in the mid @-@ 1990s in creating and designing characters , so the company had been founded .
so , i wrote this piece called , &quot; which avatar &quot; and set out absolutely to drive the development of visual effects , facts by computer , but beyond , with human characters created by computer , and the main characters would be all done by computer . and the world would be done by computer .
but the challenge was , and the business of the company told me we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so i blew it up , and i made this other movie about a big boat that falls off .
you know , i went and sold it to the studio like &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . &quot; it &apos;s going to be a <unk> romance , an incredibly exciting film .
aside , what i wanted to do was to immerse myself in the real <unk> of the titanic .
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the study didn &apos;t know .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go into the remains of <unk> . we &apos;re going to actually record them . &quot;
we &apos;ll use it at the beginning of the movie .
it &apos;s going to be really important . it &apos;s going to be a big marketing hook . &quot;
and i spoke to them to fund an expedition .
it sounds crazy . but this goes backwards to that about his imagination in creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i found myself in a russian and @-@ half miles under the water north of the atlantic , looking at the real titanic through a window .
not in a movie , not <unk> , really .
now , that made my mind fly .
and that took a lot of preparation , and we had to build cameras and lights and all those kinds of things .
although , that made me realize how much of this dive , these profound <unk> look like a space mission .
you know , it was quite technical , and it had massive planning .
you get into the capsule , you go down through that dark , you get an environment where there &apos;s no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t go back for yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like i &apos;m living a science fiction movie .
this is cool . &quot;
so , i really became fascinated by the exploration of the deep ocean .
of course , curiosity , the scientific component of that , was it . it was adventure . it was curious . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , i could imagine a creature and we could create a special effect for her , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was looking through that window .
as we did in some of our <unk> expeditions , i was looking at <unk> across the <unk> of water and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had ever seen before , that actually wasn &apos;t described by science at the same time that we saw them and <unk> them .
so , i was completely amazed by this , and i had to do more .
so , i made a curious decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic , &quot; i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to set up my job as the director of hollywood , and i &apos;m going to be a full @-@ time <unk> . &quot;
so , we started planning these expeditions .
and we end up going to the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to fill with the vehicles .
we went back to the remains of the titanic .
we got some small robots that we had created with an optical fiber coil .
and the idea was to go in and do an inner recognition of the boat , which had not been done before .
no one had ever seen the remains of the <unk> inside , never had the means to do so , so we created a technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am , on the deck of the titanic , sitting in a submersible and looking at the train that looked a lot like these , where i knew that the gang had played .
and i flew a small robotic vehicle through the ship lobby .
when i say , i manage , but my mind is in the vehicle .
as if it were physically present inside the titanic remains .
and it was the most surreal <unk> i &apos;ve ever had , because before we saw a corner , i knew what was going to have before the lights on the vehicle were slowing down , because it had been absorbed by the <unk> for months when we were doing the film .
and the <unk> was based on an accurate replica of the flat ship .
so it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
and it really made me realize the experience of the presence that you can have with these robots , through which your consciousness is embedded in a vehicle , in some other way of existence .
it was really deep .
and it can be almost as you can see what can be going on in a few decades when we start having bodies that are ready to explore , or for some other medium in many types of future <unk> that i can imagine , like a science fiction fan .
so , having done these expeditions , i really started to appreciate what was down there , in the <unk> of the deep ocean where we had unlimited animals , they &apos;re basically aliens here on earth .
they live in a landscape habitat .
they don &apos;t survive a solar @-@ powered system like us .
so , you &apos;re seeing animals that live near 500 degrees centigrade .
they may not even exist .
at the same time , i was very interested in spatial science as well , again , is the influence of science fiction , as a child .
and i ended up experimenting with the space community , very involved with nasa , with a position in nasa &apos;s advice , planning real space missions , going to russia , checking the <unk> protocols for the pre @-@ <unk> , and all that kind of stuff , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d system .
and it was fascinating .
although what i ended up doing was bringing spatial scientists with us all the way down .
and they would come together so that they would have access , they would study biologists , planetary scientists , interested in these extreme habitats , <unk> into the ventilation , <unk> to see , and take samples and test instruments , and all that .
so , there we were doing documentaries , but actually we were doing science , and especially spatial science .
i had closed the loop between being a science fiction fan , you know , as a child , and doing all this stuff .
and , you know , along the way of this journey of discovery , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . although i also learned a lot about leadership .
you may think that a director has to be a leader , a captain of the ship , and all that .
i really hadn &apos;t learned about leadership until i did those expeditions .
because i had to , at a certain point , i say , &quot; what am i doing here ? &quot;
why am i doing it ? what bag of it ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money with these programs .
i just flourished . there are no <unk> at all .
people think i &apos;m going to go to some place between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i was chewing the nails , somewhere , sitting on the beach .
i did all those movies , all those documentaries for a very small audience .
<unk> , no glory , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it because of the task itself , by the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there is , by the emotion of discovery , and by that strange <unk> that comes when a small group of people form a very tight team .
because we would do these things with 10 @-@ 12 people working for years at a time . sometimes in the sea for two @-@ and @-@ three months at a time .
and with that <unk> , you realize that the most important thing is the respect you have and you have , when you do something you can &apos;t explain to another one .
when you go back to shore and you say , &quot; we have to do this , &quot; and the fiber , and the fiber optics , and this and the other , all the technology of that , and the difficulty , the aspects of human performance when you &apos;re working in the sea , you can &apos;t explain it to people . that &apos;s maybe the police , or people who have to go together .
it creates a <unk> , a <unk> of respect .
so , when i went back to make my next movie , which was in &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to apply the same principle of leadership in which i attached to your team , and so you win your respect .
and that really changed dynamic .
and there i was with a little team , in unexplored terrain , doing &quot; avatar , &quot; creating new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
enormously exciting .
enormously challenging .
and we become a family , for a four and a half year period .
and that completely changed the way i make films .
people have <unk> about how it has changed , well , you know , we brought back to the organisms in the ocean and put them on pandora &apos;s planet .
for me , it was more a fundamental way to do the work , the process itself , which changed as a result of that .
so , what can we sum up all of this ?
what are the lessons ?
well , i think the first is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing they have .
imagination is a force that can manifest a reality .
and the respect of his team is more important than all the world &apos;s <unk> .
young filmmakers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some advice to do this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put you in limits .
other people will do it for you , don &apos;t do you yourself , don &apos;t harm you , and take risks . &quot;
nasa has a phrase that they love : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and exploration , because it &apos;s a leap of faith .
and no major effort that required innovation has been done without running any risk .
they have to be willing to run risks .
and that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to leave you with , whatever you do , fail is a choice , but fear doesn &apos;t . thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a little bit surprising because my full @-@ time work in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds , about the things that we need to invent and improve the lives of the two billion poorest .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , more important than anything else on the planet .
climate change means that for many years its crops won &apos;t grow ; there will be too much rain or rain ; things will change so that their fragile environment can &apos;t keep .
and that leads to hunger . it leads to policy riots .
climate change will be terrible for them .
also the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could choose one thing to price the price to reduce poverty , you would certainly increase energy .
the price of energy has fallen through time .
indeed , advanced civilization is based on energy advances .
the coal @-@ powered industrial revolution , and even in the years 1900 , we saw fast decrease in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have <unk> , air conditioning , we can make so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a fantastic situation with electricity in the developed world .
but as we make it more inexpensively -- and let &apos;s try to make it twice as much cheaper -- we have to deliver a new constraint , and that restriction has to do with co2 .
co2 is heating the planet , and the equation on co2 is actually very simple .
if you add the co2 that &apos;s being issued , that gives rise to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase gives rise to some very negative effects , the effects on climate , and perhaps even worse , the cumulative effects , because natural ecosystems cannot adjust to these fast changes , and then ecosystems overlap .
the exact <unk> of how to map from a certain co2 increase , until temperature we have and the exact behavior of variables , there &apos;s some uncertainty there , but not too much .
and there are surely uncertainty about what those effects will be , but they &apos;ll be extremely bad .
i &apos;ve asked the most scientists about this several times , do we really have to go down to almost zero emissions ?
can &apos;t we just cut half or a quarter ?
and the answer is , until we &apos;re not near zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we &apos;re a four @-@ foot tall truck trying to get under a three @-@ foot tall bridge , and we can somehow just pass a little bit to pass through it .
this is something that has to get to zero .
we make a lot of carbon dioxide every year , more than 1.3 million tons .
about 20 tons per american . and less than a ton per one in poor countries .
it gives an average of about five tons per person on the planet .
and in a way we have to make changes to take that number to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly increasing .
it &apos;s only because of some economic changes that have come to <unk> , so we have to go from rapidly growing to <unk> , and we &apos;re going all the way down to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication : so you have one thing on the left , co2 that you want it to be zero , and it will be based on the number of people , the services each person uses on average , energy on average for every service , and the co2 per unit of energy .
so , let &apos;s look at each and see how we can go down to zero .
probably some of these numbers will have to get very close to zero .
now , back to high school algebra , but let &apos;s get a bonus .
first , we have the population .
the world has now <unk> million people .
and it &apos;s on the way to get 13 billion .
now , if we do a big job in new vaccines , health care , and reproductive health care services , we might be able to reduce that number , maybe 10 or 15 percent , but there we see a gross increase in the rough growth of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this includes everything , the food we eat , the coat , television , heating .
these are very good things , and eliminating poverty means serving these services to almost everybody on the planet .
and it &apos;s a big thing that this number is going up .
in the rich world , perhaps the richest billion , we could reduce and use less , but every year , this figure , on average , goes up and then , in general terms , is going to more than double @-@ income services per person .
here we have a very basic service . do you have light in your house so you can read your homework ?
in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they go outside and read their homework under the light of the street lamps .
now , efficiency , &apos; e , &apos; is energy for every service , here , finally , we have good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting , through different kinds of cars , different ways of building <unk> , there are a lot of services in which you can significantly reduce energy consumption .
some individual services do it in 90 percent .
there are other services , just like the way to make fertilizers , or shipping , in which we train them to improve are much smaller .
and so , in general here , if we &apos;re optimistic , we can perhaps get to a decrease of a factor of three , maybe even a six factor .
but for these first three factors we go from <unk> million to maybe 8,000 million tons in the best cases , and that doesn &apos;t get the goal .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be the key factor -- and this is the amount of co2 pouring in every energy unit .
and the question is , can you really make it go to zero ?
if we coal , no .
if you pump natural gas , no .
almost every methods we create electricity today , except for new renewables and nuclear , they emit co2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do on a global scale , is to create a new system .
and so , we need miracles of energy .
when i use that word , i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and services are a miracle .
the people who are here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
we don &apos;t usually have a date , where you have to have the miracle ready for some date .
usually , in a way you expect , and some people come , and others don &apos;t .
this is a case where we really have to move at maximum speed and achieve a miracle in a very clenched time .
i thought , how can i really capture this concept ?
is there any kind of natural illustration ? have you any demonstration that <unk> people &apos;s imagination ?
i thought , in the past year when i brought mosquitoes , and in a sense , people will cheat it .
i actually got the idea that , you know , there are people living with mosquitos .
so , with energy , the only thing that occurred to me was this .
i decided that falling fireflies would be my contribution towards the environment , here , this year .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
i &apos;ve been told that i don &apos;t shave , actually , maybe don &apos;t get out of this jar .
now , there are all kinds of simplistic solutions like that , but in the end , they don &apos;t quite add up to it .
we need solutions , it can be one or several , that have an unimaginable scale , and an unimaginable reliability , and , although there are many directions that people are looking for , i only see five that can make big changes .
i put aside nuclear power , geothermal , geothermal , fusion and bio @-@ fuels .
those can get to make a contribution , and if you can get more than i hope , much better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work in each of these five , and we can &apos;t get into any of them because they look alike , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels that are burning , both burning or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there seems simple , but it &apos;s not , and this is to take all the co2 after the burning of it at high pressure , create a liquid , put it in some place , and expect it to stay there .
we have a pilot tests that accomplish this with a success between 60 and 80 percent , but reaching up to 100 percent , that will be very difficult , and put according to where these amount of co2 will be difficult , but the most difficult thing here is the longer @-@ term topic .
is it going to be safe ?
does it make sure that it &apos;s literally one billion times bigger than any other kind of garbage compared to nuclear or other ?
this is a lot of volume .
so , this is complicated .
next , it would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems . the cost is high , particularly in highly controversial countries . the security issue , feeling really well that nothing can fail , that even having human operators , the fuel doesn &apos;t use for weapons .
and then what to do with waste ?
and even if it &apos;s not too big , there are lots of worries about it .
people need to feel quiet about it .
so it &apos;s three very difficult problems that could be solved , and it should then work on them .
we <unk> the last three out of five .
these are the ones that many times people refer to as renewable sources .
and actually -- although it &apos;s very good that they don &apos;t require gas -- they have some <unk> .
one is that energy density in these technologies is dramatically lower than a power plant .
these are energy farms , so we &apos;re talking about lots of square kilometers , surfaces thousands of times bigger than traditional energy plants .
in addition , these are blinking sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t shine all day ; it doesn &apos;t glow every day , and in the same way , the <unk> doesn &apos;t blow all the time .
and so , if we rely on these sources , we have to have some way of getting energy through those periods where it &apos;s not available .
so here we have big costs . we have population challenges . for example , if this energy is out of our country , we don &apos;t just need technology , but we have to deal with the risk of energy coming from the other side .
and finally , this storage problem .
and , to examine that , i investigate and i look for all the kinds of batteries that are made for cars , computers , phones , phones , <unk> , for everything , and i compared that amount of electrical energy that the world uses , and what i discovered is that all the batteries that we make could now store less than 10 minutes of that energy .
so , actually , we need a big breakthrough in this regard , an improvement by a factor of a hundred or more than the advances we have today .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not very easy .
this is what appears when you try to get the <unk> source to be up for 20 or 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re relying on this for 100 percent , you need an incredible choice battery .
how are we going to move forward to this ? what &apos;s the right way of <unk> ?
is it like the manhattan project ? what is it that &apos;s going to take us right ?
well , we need a lot of companies working on this , working on it .
in each of these five ways , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , pick them up and say they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
and i think here at the ted group , we have a lot of people who are already chasing this goal .
bill <unk> has several companies , including one called <unk> , which has several very good solar technologies .
<unk> <unk> is investing in dozens of companies that are doing big things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to convince them .
with nathan myhrvold -- we &apos;re criticizing a <unk> that is , perhaps surprisingly , centered on nuclear .
there are innovations in nuclear : modular , liquid .
and the innovation takes off in this industry quite a long time ago , so the concept that there are some good ideas running is not surprising at all .
the idea behind <unk> is that instead of burning part of the uranium , one percent , which is <unk> , we decided , we will save 99 percent , we will burn it .
it &apos;s a crazy idea .
in fact , people have talked about this for a long time , but they could never properly mimic whether it would work or not , and it &apos;s through the arrival of the modern supercomputers that you can mimic and see that , yes , with the right material approach , it seems that it could work .
and because you &apos;re burning 99 percent , you have highly improved costs .
you &apos;re actually burning the waste , and you can use it as fuel all the waste that comes from today &apos;s reactors .
so instead of worrying about them , you use them . it &apos;s a big thing .
it &apos;s consuming this uranium as it moves . it &apos;s like a candle .
as you can see there , it &apos;s a log , it often acts like a radiation wave reactor .
at the gas level , this really solves the problem .
i have a picture here from a place in kentucky state .
this is the waste , 99 percent , of the stuff that &apos;s already taken out of the stuff that &apos;s burning now , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
that <unk> from electricity to the united states for hundreds of years .
and simply by putting seawater through low @-@ cost processes , you &apos;d have enough gas for the entire rest of the planet .
so , as you know , it has a lot of challenges ahead , but it &apos;s an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to go ahead .
so , let &apos;s think , how should we define ourselves ?
what should our school address look like ?
well , let &apos;s look where we really have to get , and then look at the middle point .
by 2050 , many people listened to this 80 percent reduction .
it &apos;s really important that we get to that point .
and that 20 percent is going to be used by needs in poor countries like agriculture ; we have hopefully cut <unk> and concrete .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to change its electrical generation completely .
so , the other note is : are we getting this zero @-@ emission technology ? have we <unk> it in all developed countries ? and are we in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
that &apos;s very important .
it &apos;s a key element to pass that school newsletter .
so , going back from there , how should you see the cartoon of the year 2020 ?
well , again , it should have two elements .
we should actually implement these efficiency measures to begin to have reductions , the less <unk> , the less the sum of co2 , and therefore the less the temperature will be .
but in some ways , the note that we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way down to the big <unk> , is just the same , or maybe even a little less important than the other , which is the piece of innovation of these big breakthroughs .
these advances , we need to move at maximum speed , and we can measure that at the level of companies , race projects , and require that they have changed .
there are many good books that have been written about this .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; our <unk> &quot; and the book of david <unk> , &quot; sustainable energy , not hot air . &quot;
they really study it and create a framework for this to be broadly discussed , because we need a broad support for this .
there &apos;s a lot to talk about .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish for this technology .
if i had just one wish for the next 50 years , i could choose who &apos;s president , i could choose a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could choose that this thing that has half the cost and zero co2 emissions is invented this wish for me to survive .
this is the biggest impact .
if we can &apos;t have this wish , the division between the people who think in the short term and in the long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and rich countries , and most of the lives of those 2,000 million will be much worse .
so , what should we do ?
what am i focusing on you so you step forward and drive ?
we need to look more funding for research .
when countries come together in places like copenhagen , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss on this innovation agenda , and they would be amazed at these low @-@ cost levels of these innovative approaches .
we need the market incentives , co2 tax incentives , market for carbon bonds , something that <unk> that price signal .
we need to spread the message .
we need this <unk> to be more rational , to be a more egalitarian <unk> , including the steps facing the government .
this is an important desire , but it &apos;s a wish that i think we can reach .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand more about <unk> , right -- i mean , first of all : can you give us a sense of what the scale of investment would be ?
bill gates : to make the software out of super @-@ computer , to employ all of the big scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even test our materials on a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , there would only be 10 million .
the hard thing is to build the pilot , get the various billions , find the regulator , the location where it would be to build the first of these .
once you have the first built , and if it works as <unk> , then it &apos;s clear as the day , because the economic variables and energy density are as different from nuclear as we know it .
to understand good , this means building deeply on the ground , almost like a vertical nuclear fuel column , of these kinds of uranium already used , and then the process starts from above and then going down ?
<unk> : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always getting gasoline from the reactor , so you have lots and lots of controls that can have a mistake that you have to open and move things in and out . that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel from which you can already carry for about 60 years -- just think of it as a trunk -- relax and not have those same complications .
and it just stays there and it burns for the 1960s , and then it &apos;s .
it &apos;s a nuclear plant that includes its own solution of waste disposal .
<unk> : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can leave it there -- there &apos;s much less waste with this approach -- then you can actually grab that one , and put it in another and burn that .
and we started taking the waste that exists on the current day , which is in these cooling <unk> or &apos; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which is our gas to start .
so what was a problem for those reactors is with what we feed our kids , and you &apos;re reducing the volume of waste in a fairly <unk> way by going the way .
but when you talk to different people around the world , about these possibilities .
where is there more interest to actually do something with this ?
<unk> : well , we haven &apos;t chosen a particular place , and there are all these rules of about anything called nuclear , so we &apos;re very interested in people from the company who &apos;ve been in russia , india and china . i &apos;ve been here with the nuclear police , talking about how this would fit into the energy agenda .
so i &apos;m optimistic . french and japanese have done some work .
this is a variation on something that has been previously done .
it &apos;s a big advance , but it &apos;s like a fast reactor , and many countries have built it , so anyone who has done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first is built .
so , in your head , scale of times and likelihood of putting online some of this kind ?
<unk> : well , we need , first one of these things with large @-@ generation projection that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to implement .
that &apos;s kind of the term that we have to be aware of environmental models .
and , you know , if things work well , that it &apos;s very wish , it could easily be distracted .
and there are now , fortunately , dozens of companies , but we need them to be hundreds , which at once , if their science works well , if funding for their pilots working well , that they can compete for this .
and it &apos;s better if several of them are successful , because you could use a mixture .
we need a successful being successful .
in terms of large @-@ scale changes , this is the biggest thing that you know is ?
<unk> : a revolutionary progress in energy is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without environmental constraint , but environmental restriction makes it much more important .
in the nuclear world , there are other innovators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their jobs as well as we know this , but the modular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid figure that looks a little bit difficult , but maybe tell the same thing about us .
and so , there are several different , but the beauty in this is that uranium atom has millions of times more energy than for example a carbon atom and then , if you can deal with the negative dots , which are essentially radiation , the footprint and the cost , in terms of effect on the ground and various things , is almost in a category .
what if this doesn &apos;t work , then ?
should we start taking an emergency measure so we should try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
<unk> : if you go into that situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve had a fan of more , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack . and what do you do ? you probably need heart surgery or something .
there &apos;s a research line on something called geo @-@ engineering , which are various techniques that can reduce warming to give us maybe 20 or 30 years , until we agree .
now , that &apos;s just a insurance <unk> .
you don &apos;t expect to do that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t work on the insurance tank , because you can make your breakfast and eat because you know that heart surgery will save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the option given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the discussion about geo @-@ engineering , if we should have a list in our sleeve , in case things happen quicker , or that innovation is much slower than it was expected .
climate skeptical : if you had a sentence or two to tell you , like the <unk> that are wrong ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , skeptical come from different sides .
scientists who make scientific arguments are very few .
are you saying that there are negative feedback effects that you have to do with clouds that offset things ?
there are very , very few things that you can even say there &apos;s a possibility in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here is something like aids .
you increase the error now , and you pay the price much later .
and so , when you have all kinds of urgent problems , the idea of suffering now that it has to do with a profit later -- and a meaningful suffering -- and in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst stage , and there are people in the developed world who look at the ipcc and say , well , this is not a big deal .
the fact is that it &apos;s that uncertain part that it should be <unk> towards this .
but my dream here is that if you can do it in an economic way , and fulfilling the constraints of co2 , then the skeptical will say , well , i don &apos;t care that i don &apos;t eat co2 , somehow i wish i &apos;d co2 , but i think i accept it because it &apos;s cheaper .
and so , that would be your answer to the <unk> argument , which basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take your attention out of your other objectives of trying to release the world of poverty , and malaria , and so that investing money in that is a waste of the resources of the earth when there is better things that we can do .
<unk> : well , real spending on the part of i and d -- says america should spend 10 million more than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t take other things away .
the moment you go into big numbers , and in this reasonable people can disagree , it &apos;s when you have something that &apos;s not economical and you &apos;re trying to cure them . that , to me , is largely a waste .
unless you &apos;re too close , and you &apos;re funding the learning curve and it &apos;s going to get really cheap . i think we should try more things that have a potential to be much less expensive .
if the exchange you enter is , let &apos;s make the super expensive energy , then rich can buy it .
i mean , everybody here could pay five times more for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disaster is for those two billion .
and even <unk> has changed .
his <unk> now is , because isn &apos;t he arguing more about me and d ?
he &apos;s still , for his earlier arguments , associated with the side of the skeptical , but he &apos;s realized he &apos;s on a pretty lonely side , and then he &apos;s <unk> the argument of the i r &amp; amp ; d.
and then there &apos;s a string of something that i think is appropriate .
the r &amp; amp ; d part , it &apos;s amazing how little it &apos;s being funded .
well bill , i suspect i speak in the name of most people here saying , i really hope your wish is going to be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> introduced the <unk> of design called the marshmallow challenge .
and the idea is quite simple . four people have to build an autonomous structure with 20 <unk> , a string <unk> , a string <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to go up .
and although it sounds easy , it &apos;s quite difficult , because it force people to collaborate very fast .
and so i thought it was an interesting idea , and i put it in a design shop .
and it was a big success .
and since then , i &apos;ve done some 70 design workshops around the world with students , designers and architects , all the way to the <unk> of major companies and there &apos;s something particular about this exercise that reveals deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i would like to share some of them with you .
most people start working with the task .
the members argue and figure out how the structure will be resolved , governed by power .
then time is planned , organizing . you draw it and you have spaghetti .
they spend most of their time setting the strands into structures .
and finally , right when you just take out the marshmallow , and with a grain of salt , it puts it on top , and then it <unk> away , and &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
but actually , what tends to happen is that the da @-@ da @-@ da @-@ that becomes &quot; oh @-@ no @-@ &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow makes the whole structure collapse .
so there are several people who have more moments of &quot; oh no &quot; than others , and the worst are the graduates at business school .
they lie , they cheat , they <unk> , and they produce <unk> structures .
and , of course , there are teams that have a lot more structures -- ... &quot; da @-@ da &quot; and , amongst the best ones , there are the graduates of kindergarten .
and this is quite amazing .
peter tells us , they can &apos;t only get the highest structures , but they &apos;re also the most interesting structures of all .
so , what you want to ask is : how ? why ? what do you have ?
peter likes to say , &quot; no children try to be the ceo of spaghetti sauce . &quot; right .
they don &apos;t spend time fighting .
but there &apos;s also another reason .
and that is that business students are trained to find the only right plan , ok .
and then they don &apos;t .
and what happens , when you put the marshmallow on the back , they stay out of time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
does it sound something ? ok .
what kids do differently , is they start with the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , we always keep the marshmallow on top , so they have a lot of opportunities for failed prototypes in the process .
designers consider this kind of collaboration as the essence of the engineering process .
and with every version , kids are receiving remarkable observations about what works and what &apos;s not .
so , the ability to play with prototypes is essential , but look at how they deliver different teams .
the average for most is about half feet , business students , achieve half of that , lawyers , a little bit better , but not much more , children , better than most adults .
who gives better than anyone ?
architects and engineers , thank god !
the highest structure i &apos;ve seen is one meter .
why is it ? because they understand that the triangles and the self @-@ sustain patterns are the key to building stable structures .
ceos , a little better than average , but this is where it gets interesting .
if you put a management executive in the team , ceos actually improve .
it &apos;s amazing . take a look and say , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can notice them beforehand . and why ?
because they have special skills of self @-@ similarity .
they drive the process , they understand it .
and any team that manages to manage and do well in the work would really enhance the throughput of his team .
specialized skills and <unk> , and the combination leads to success .
if you have 10 teams that tend to work together , we will work with about six stable structures .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s make the bet .
i decided to give 10,000 dollars in software to the winning team .
and what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . none of the teams actually had a stable structure .
if someone had built , say , an inch @-@ inch structure , they could have taken the prize for home .
isn &apos;t it interesting that high risk has a strong impact ?
we did the same test with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
under these conditions , they understood the value of prototypes .
and the same team step from being the worst to being amongst the best .
they get the highest structures in the lower time .
there are important lessons here about the phenomenon of incentives and success .
you &apos;d say , &quot; why would someone spend time designing a challenge of the marshmallow ? &quot;
and the reason is , i will help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and the challenge of the marshmallow is to help you identify the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , all the projects have their marshmallow , right ?
the challenge provides a shared experience , common language , a common stance of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of the experience , of this simple exercise .
and those of you , you might want to visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build <unk> .
there are hand @-@ by @-@ step instructions on this .
there are insane examples that come from around the world as people change and track the system .
there are world records as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i think , is that design is a contact sport .
it demands that we have all our senses on the task , and let us apply our best ideas , our sentiments and acts on the presumption that we care about .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all you need to take us out of a &quot; oh @-@ no @-@ &quot; moment &quot; at a moment . &quot;
and that can create a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s realize that right here we have a machine .
a big machine , a super @-@ , ted @-@ style machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get in .
and you can go back , you can go in front ; you can &apos;t stay where you are .
and i wonder what you would choose , because i was asking my friends this question quite recently , and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . you want to go back before i had <unk> or twitter , or &quot; american idol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of <unk> towards nostalgia , towards magic thinking .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back to the past , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because the possibilities on this planet , they &apos;re not going back , they &apos;re going forward .
so i want to get into the machine , and i want to go ahead .
this is the best time i &apos;ve ever spent on this planet under any criteria you want to use : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , disease rates going down .
there has never been a while like this .
my <unk> died , all of them when they arrived in the 1960s .
my grandparents honored that number to 70 .
my parents are closing in 80 .
so it &apos;s better than there &apos;s nine at the beginning of my number of death .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is much bigger than that .
a child born in new delhi today can wait to live as much as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about that . it &apos;s an amazing fact .
and why is this true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed millions of people on this planet .
it <unk> the demographics in a way that no war has done .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s disappeared .
we <unk> it . we <unk> .
in the rich world , diseases that displace millions of us just one generation ago , there &apos;s almost no more .
<unk> , polio .
someone even knows they &apos;re that stuff ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are wins from the scientific method .
and in my mind , the scientific method , testing things , see if it works , change it when it doesn &apos;t work , is one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the only good news because there are other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
and one of them is that , despite all our achievements , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world , every day .
that number is growing , and it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s unfortunately .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to <unk> this world .
clean water , gas soil , rainforests , oil , gas : they &apos;re running out , and they &apos;re running out very soon , and unless we stop it in a solution to this disaster , we &apos;re also leaving ourselves .
so , the question is : we can do it ? i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that <unk> billions of people without <unk> the land we live in .
i think we can feed this world with energy that we can &apos;t do it at once .
i really believe this , and , no , it &apos;s not magic thinking .
but there &apos;s one thing that doesn &apos;t let me sleep -- one of the things that keeps me awake . we &apos;ve never needed the progress of science more than now .
and we &apos;ve never been in a position to think properly , as we can today .
we &apos;re at the edge of amazing events in many fields , and yet , i certainly think we should go back hundreds , 300 years , before the enlightenment , to find a time when we &apos;re going to cross progress , where we &apos;re going to measure these things more <unk> , more expansive , than we &apos;re doing now .
people lie in their beliefs , and they do it so <unk> that you can &apos;t release them .
it won &apos;t even make them free .
and listen , everybody has a right to have their opinion ; they have a right to have their opinion about progress .
but you know what you have no right ?
you have no right to have your own facts . sorry , but you don &apos;t .
and realizing this took me a while .
a decade ago , i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker , a short story .
and i &apos;m just surprised to find opposition , as opposed to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do , i wrote an article and i went ahead .
and soon after that , i wrote an article on genetically modified foods .
the same thing happened , only worse .
people applaud .
so i wrote an article about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; go food , &quot; why we knew that moving from place in a specific way , more than a neglected area of nature .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article and i went ahead .
i mean , i &apos;m just a journalist .
<unk> , <unk> , go for dinner , okay .
but these stories provided me , and i couldn &apos;t understand why , and i finally understood .
and that happened because the fans who was going crazy weren &apos;t really fans .
i was thinking , people who were polite , people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and i was so worried .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship with progress that we used to have .
we talk about him <unk> .
we talk about him in terms of <unk> , quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we have lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science itself , and there &apos;s no reason why we haven &apos;t done it .
you can just say a few names and the <unk> people .
<unk> , the challenger , the challenger , weapons of mass destruction , <unk> electoral <unk> .
i mean , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe that they were always right , so be skeptical .
ask questions , we test evidence .
don &apos;t take any for granted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get evidence , you have to accept evidence , and we &apos;re not good at doing that .
and the reason i can say this is because we &apos;re now in a fear epidemic i &apos;ve never seen before , and i hope i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a post @-@ modernist story , a horrible story , that <unk> the autism epidemic to receive the vaccine against measles , <unk> and <unk> .
very scary .
lots of studies were done to see if this was true .
lots of studies had to be done , that &apos;s a serious issue .
the results arrived .
the results came from the united states , england , from sweden , from canada , and everything was the same thing , no correlation , no connection , nothing .
that doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe in what we see , in what we think we see , in what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a lot of government documents by giving us information , and i understand that , i think we all understand .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disastrous .
disastrous for this fact : the united states is one of the few countries in the world where immunization rate is going down .
this is unfortunate , and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
it &apos;s horrible .
what kind of thing happened so we could do that .
now , i understand . i certainly understand it .
because here , some of you have measles ?
have you ever seen anyone die from measles ?
it doesn &apos;t happen very much .
it doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened sometimes in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from measles , 20 an hour .
but because it hasn &apos;t happened here , we can get it out of our minds , and people like jenny can predict fear and illiteracy from fear and illiteracy from parts like oprah and larry <unk> .
and you can do it because you don &apos;t have causality and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these two things look the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same thing .
and it &apos;s something we have to learn , and we need to learn very soon .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
the moved away from us one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no agony : polio , <unk> , no more .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul <unk> .
he only developed a <unk> vaccine with a group of people .
it saves the lives of 400,000 children per year , in the troubled world .
pretty good , no ?
well , it &apos;s okay , except , because paul is out there talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and people should just stop .
and it really says that .
so , paul is a terrorist .
when paul speaks in a public audience , he can &apos;t deal with arms guards .
he gets calls in his house because people like to tell him that they remember where their kids are going to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
and i don &apos;t need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you get them out , and diseases come back , awful diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of that again because it &apos;s just a number game .
and they &apos;re not going to die only from measles .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a school companion wrote me a few weeks ago and said i thought i was a little stubborn .
never before had anyone said that .
she was not going to get her child to polio . anyway .
okay .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio , and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy took a plane in lagos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to los angeles , right now he &apos;s on ohio .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these fantastic ted dinners tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works .
this is the planet we live on . we don &apos;t do it as we don &apos;t .
now , we love <unk> . we love doing it .
they all took their vitamins to this morning ?
<unk> , a little <unk> to stay young .
i know they did it because half americans do it every day .
they take those things , and they take choices , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find that they don &apos;t serve at all .
data tells you all the time .
your urine . they almost never do more than that .
okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m totally with you .
urine , dark .
why do we do this ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand , we hate the great drug .
we hate big governments . we don &apos;t trust the guy .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our healthcare system sucks .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolute and amazingly cold , and it &apos;s even good for those that we can pay for .
so let &apos;s move from him , and where are we running ?
we jump to the arms of the great plains .
it &apos;s fantastic . i love the grand mufti .
but , you know , it &apos;s a really serious thing because these things are garbage , and we spend billions of dollars on them .
and i have all kinds of little supplements here .
none of them -- <unk> , fraud , fraud , fraud , fraud , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know it &apos;s but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on this ; it &apos;s a fraud .
and you know what ? when i say this , people shout me out , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do whatever they want .
he makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because i &apos;m not going to be disappointed if it &apos;s the minister of health who says , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m not going to do any case of the evidence of my experts in <unk> , &quot; or some sort of <unk> oncologist who wants to treat his patient with coffee <unk> .
when you start the <unk> where you believe and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in south africa .
he killed 400,000 people of his people to insist that the <unk> and lemon oil were much more effective than anti @-@ retroviral drugs that we know can reduce aids progress .
hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths in a country that has been destroyed more than any one for this disease .
please don &apos;t tell me there &apos;s no consequences for these things .
there are . there are always .
now , the most insane epidemic in which we &apos;re very invested right now is this insane battle between which genetically modified foods and organic elite .
it &apos;s a post @-@ conflict debate . it has to end .
it &apos;s a debate about words , metaphors .
ideology is not science .
every thing we eat , every grain of rice , every kilogram of <unk> , every <unk> of brussels , has been modified by the man .
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden of eden .
there was no <unk> .
there were no christmas trees . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some things worked and others didn &apos;t .
we got rid of what didn &apos;t work .
now we can do it much more precisely , and there are risks , absolutely . but we can put a little bit of vitamin a in rice , and that can help millions , millions of people , as extending their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do that ?
i must say , i don &apos;t understand .
we are attacking genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , crop , crop , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want life @-@ changing companies .
we don &apos;t want seed companies .
and you know what my answer to that ?
yes , they &apos;re right . they &apos;re <unk> .
it &apos;s true , we have a very big problem of feeding , but this is not science .
it has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s the law ; it &apos;s the moral ; it &apos;s the patent issue .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea . it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t let science do its work because we have fear , it &apos;s really fatal , and it prevent millions of people can thrive .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to produce 70 percent more food than today , 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
they need it , and we &apos;re not going to steal it .
and why ? genetically modified foods .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat those bad things , like <unk> , for example .
<unk> is something that 500 million people eat .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a lot of calories . it sucks .
and it has no nutrients , it has no proteins , and scientists are actually modifying all this in it right now .
and then people could eat it , and they could avoid being blind .
you don &apos;t die of hunger , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is , why are we exhausted ?
i mean , hey , why are we exhausted ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes back ?
it &apos;s about moving genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> to have bigger food , better food , unique food .
this is not about &quot; rice krispies , &quot; this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s time for us to start to understand what that means .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act like now , we are guilty of something that i don &apos;t think we should be guilty about , colonialism . &quot;
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s beyond us , and we really have to fix it .
so , after this funny conversation , you may want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go ahead ? &quot;
absolutely . i want .
it &apos;s <unk> in the present now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can program that time machine in what we want .
we can move where we want , and we &apos;re going to move where we want to move .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but when we get stuck in the machine and go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy to do it .
i know we can , and , as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the effect of the <unk> , which may seem a strange thing about what a magician might be interested in , not to be thinking about the way i do it , which is , &quot; if somebody believes something fake enough , it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have a measurable effect in some studies , placebo effects , just because one person thinks that what &apos;s going on is a pharmaceutical thing , or something like driving pain management , for example , if you believe enough , there &apos;s a measurable effect on the body , called the placebo effect .
something fake turns into something real because of the perception you have .
so we better understand , i want to start by showing you a simple magic trick and rudimentary .
and i &apos;m going to demonstrate to you how it works . this is a trick that has been in children &apos;s books since at least the 1950s .
i learned it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it to you .
and then i &apos;ll tell you why i explained it .
this is what happens .
the knife , which you can examine , my hand , which you can examine .
he <unk> the knife in my fist like this .
hold my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing goes up or down , hold up my wrist right here .
so , at any point , i can move , at the time that my wrist <unk> here can &apos;t go up or down my sleeve .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and i hope , if all this <unk> , my animal magnetism <unk> the knife .
in fact , it &apos;s sustained so hard that i can hide , and the knife does not fall down .
nothing goes up or down my sleeve , none of you can look at everything .
<unk> !
so , this is the trick that i usually teach young people who are interested in <unk> , because they can learn a lot about delusions studying this trick -- even though it &apos;s a simple trick .
probably a lot of you in this room know the trick .
what happens is this .
i &apos;m holding the knife with my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to hold my wrist , and make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve , it &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding my wrist is because that &apos;s really the secret of illusion .
the moment the front of my hand moves to be hidden from you , this finger , my finger will move where it is , to a position pointed like that .
very good .
someone who didn &apos;t have childhood is over there .
so , it moves over here .
and as i move , my finger moves .
and we could talk about why it &apos;s a deception , why they didn &apos;t realize there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , doesn &apos;t count one , two , three . the <unk> .
but that &apos;s not really what this is all about , right ? so , i open my hand .
obviously , it &apos;s hanging there and not by animal magnetism , if not fraud , my finger lies there .
and when i close my finger , like that , when i move , this movement sort of covers my finger &apos;s <unk> .
he retirement his hand . he <unk> the knife .
this is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
i read a study , about a year ago that really opened my mind .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an amazing thing .
it turns out that if you use a placebo in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s like the shape of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round pill , it has certain effects .
but if you change the way you measure placebo , like doing a smaller pill , blue <unk> , and you give a letter , it &apos;s notoriously effective .
even though none of the two have a pharmaceutical effect -- those are sugar pills .
but the white pill , it &apos;s not as good as the blue pill .
what ? that really stuck with me .
but it turns out that &apos;s not all .
if you have capsules , they &apos;re more effective than any other tablet .
a colored capsule , this is yellow on one side and red on the other , is <unk> that a white capsule .
<unk> has something to do with this .
a pill twice a day , it &apos;s not as good as three <unk> -- i don &apos;t remember the statistics now . i &apos;m sorry .
but the point is ...
these <unk> have something to do .
and the shape also has something to do with it .
and if you want the last placebo , you go to the needles .
right ? a syringe had something <unk> a couple of hundred <unk> of something dead , and we <unk> this to the patient .
this is a very powerful picture in your mind , this is much stronger than any white pill .
it really is , this graph , i &apos;m going to show you in another moment when you have the slides .
the point is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , and this isn &apos;t as good as the capsule and this is not as good as the needle .
and no really has any pharmaceutical quality . it &apos;s just your belief that makes it real in your body and creates a strong effect .
i would like to see if you could actually take that idea , and apply it to a magic trick .
take something which is really a fake trick and make it look real .
and we know from that study , that when you want something real , you get stressed out of needles .
this is a seven @-@ inch hat dwarf hat , and i &apos;m going to pick it up a little bit .
this is my tissue . this is not . the special tissue of <unk> .
this is my skin . it &apos;s not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to penetrate my skin , and get through the needle into the other side .
if you were injured -- if you were easily distracted -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel on the other night , and other people who didn &apos;t know , and a woman nearly drowned .
so i would suggest that if you &apos;re too close , look on the other side by the next few -- actually , you know what ? i &apos;m going to do this first part of it in hide .
you &apos;ll see , you can look on the other side if you want .
so , this is what happens , the beginning of my tissue at the bottom of my arm , i made a little <unk> .
sorry , am i stopping you ?
and i rub my skin a little bit , and i take it off the other side like this .
now , we &apos;re essentially in the same position as the knife trick .
somehow .
but right now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , or you ?
so let me go . one , two , three , four , five .
yes , good ...
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; well , he &apos;s not as dumb as to cut the skin just for a few minutes . &quot;
so , let me show you a little bit .
how are they going ? okay .
yes , i am .
and people back up there will say , &quot; well , i really didn &apos;t see it . &quot;
the people in the <unk> are starting to move .
let me show you a little bit more .
this is really my skin . it &apos;s not a <unk> effect of hollywood .
this is my meat and i can move around .
sorry , if you &apos;re squeamish , look for another <unk> , don &apos;t look at this .
the people in the back or the people who see the video will say , &quot; well , you see the effect , &quot; but if it were real , he would do this -- notice that there &apos;s a hole here and another there , if it were real , he would be <unk> .
well , let me show you a little bit of blood .
yes , there it is .
usually , now he would be taking the needle .
i punched my arm and showed them that there &apos;s no wounds .
but i think in this context , and with the idea of taking something fake , and making it real , i &apos;ll leave it like that , and out of the stage .
i &apos;ll be watching you several times during the morning .
i hope you will . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness in these days .
i made someone tell the number of books with the word &quot; happiness &quot; in the title , published in the last five years and gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there &apos;s an enormous amount of interest in happiness , between researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of advice about happiness .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all this crowd of jobs , there are several peaks of cognitive kinds that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today will be especially about these cognitive traps .
this is both about the ordinary people who think about their own <unk> as the academics who think about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re as confused as others .
the first of these tar is the <unk> in order to admit its complexity .
turns out that the word happiness is no longer a useful word because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we might be able to shave , but in general , this is something that we &apos;re going to have to throw away , and we &apos;re going to have to embrace the most complicated point of view of what the well @-@ being is .
second trap is a confusion between experience and memory : particularly being happy in life and being happy with your life or value your life as happy .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the illusion of focus , and it &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think of any <unk> that affects well @-@ being without <unk> its importance .
i mean , this is a fundamental cognitive trap .
it &apos;s impossible not to be wrong .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone in a conference session of questions and answers after one of my lectures that told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; -- he said he had been listening to a symphony and which was an absolutely wonderful music and at the end of the recording , there was a horrible sound .
and then he added , really affected , that that had <unk> the whole experience .
but it wasn &apos;t .
what had been cleared off was the memories of that experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of a glorious music .
and they didn &apos;t know at all because they got a memory , the memory had gone wrong , and it was all he had left .
what this tells us , actually , is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two people .
there &apos;s a self that has experiences , that lives in the present and meets the present , is able to revive the past , but it basically only has the present .
it &apos;s the self that has experiences that treat a physician when you ask , &quot; do you hurt now , when i play here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a self that remembers , and the self that remember is the one that takes note , and it holds the history of our life , and it &apos;s the doctor asks him , &quot; how does it feel lately ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something .
these are two very different entities , the self that has experiences and the self that has memories and <unk> between them is part of the problematic notion of happiness .
now , the self that has memories is a storyteller .
and that begins really as an immediate response to our memories -- it &apos;s <unk> .
we don &apos;t just tell stories , when we tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we have left to remember from our experiences is a story .
and let me start with an example .
this is an old study .
these are real patients being treated by painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into details . it &apos;s not painful these days , but it was , when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to lie on their pain every 60 seconds .
and here we have two patients . this is their data .
and if you ask , &quot; who suffered more ? &quot;
it &apos;s a very easy question .
of course , the patient b suffered more -- his <unk> lasted longer , and every minute of pain than the patient had -- also he had the patient b and even more .
but now we ask another question , &quot; how much do you think these patients have suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s the surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient a had a much worse memory of the <unk> than the patient b.
stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is the way it ends .
and none of these stories inspires a lot or is great , but one of them is different ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse one was the one where the pain had its peak at the end . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know ?
because we asked these people after the <unk> , and a lot later , &quot; how painful was the experience , usually ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than b in the way you remember it .
so it &apos;s a direct conflict between me and experiences and the self that remember .
from the standpoint of the self that has experiences , it &apos;s clear that b had a worse experience .
now , what we could do with the patient a , and actually do clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it really works , could extend the <unk> of the patient a with just keeping the tube off without it moving too much .
that will make the patient suffer , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you do it for a couple of minutes , you &apos;ve made the self that has experiences from the patient a to tell us a worse situation , and that the one i remember from the patient a is much better , because now you &apos;ve given the patient a &apos;s better story about their experience .
what defines a story ?
and that &apos;s true of the stories that memory provides us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we invent .
what defines a story is changes , the important moments and the end .
the end is very , very important and , in this case , we &apos;ll take the end .
now , the self that has experiences lives in a continuous form .
he has experiences , one after the other .
and you said , what about these experiences ?
and the answer is very simple . they lose forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve calculated it -- <unk> , the psychological present is saying it has about three seconds of length , which means that in a life there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there are close to 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave any traces .
most of them are completely ignored by the self that reminds .
and yet , in a way , we seem to be aware that what happens to us in these moments and experiences is our life .
it &apos;s the finite resource we have while we &apos;re in this world .
and how to use it , it seems to be relevant , but that &apos;s not the story that we have for us the self to remember .
so we have the self that reminds and the self that has experiences , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is in their treatment of time .
from the standpoint of the self that has experiences , if you have a vacation , and the second week is as good as the first , then these two @-@ week vacation is twice as good compared to a vacation of a week .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all i remember .
for me , remember , two weeks of vacation are just better than one week &apos;s vacation , because you don &apos;t get new memories .
it hasn &apos;t changed history .
and in this way , time is really the fundamental variable that distinguishes the self that remembers the self that has experiences . time has very little impact on this story .
now , the self that remembers makes more than remember and storytelling .
actually , it &apos;s the decision @-@ making , because , if you have a patient who has had , let &apos;s say , two <unk> with two different surgeons and have to decide which of them to choose , then , engage that surgeon who has a less powerful memory to that surgeon .
the self that has experiences has no voice or vote in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between experiences memories .
and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think about our future normally in terms of experiences .
we think of our future in terms of predictable memories .
and you can essentially see it , as a tyranny of self that remembers , and you can think of it as <unk> the self that has experiences to have experiences that it doesn &apos;t really need .
i have the feeling that when we go from vacation , it &apos;s a very frequent case , i mean , we go on vacation , largely , to the service of myself , to remember .
and i think this is a little hard to justify .
i mean , how much do we think about our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that is given to the dominance of the self that remembers .
and when i think about it , i think about vacation that we had at antarctica a few years ago , that they were certainly the best vacation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think about them in relative frequency , compared to how much i think about other vacation .
and i probably thought about my memories of that three @-@ week journey , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
well , if i had ever opened the folder with the 600 photos on it , i would have spent another time .
that for three weeks , and it &apos;s about an hour and a half .
there seems to be a fault .
well , i may seem a little extreme , in the very few , if i want to think about my memories , but even if we slow it down , it comes a big question . why do we give our memories so important to the importance of importance that we give to experiences ?
so i want you to come up with an experiment about thought .
imagine that in your next holidays , you know , at the end of your vacation , your whole photos will be taken , and you &apos;ll buy a drug that you didn &apos;t buy anything .
now , do you have the same vacation ?
and if you go to a few different holidays , there would be a conflict between your two <unk> , and you have to think about how you might affect that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not that obvious , because , if you tear it up in terms of time , you &apos;ll get a response . and if you put it in terms of memories , you &apos;ll get another answer .
why do we choose the holidays we chose ? it &apos;s a problem that takes us back to a choice between the two <unk> .
now , the two <unk> do pose two notions of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can benefit from , one for each of us .
so you can ask : how happy is the self that has experiences ?
and then you get excited : how are you happy in the life of the self that has experiences ?
and everyone is -- happiness at every moment is a fairly complicated process .
what emotions can be measured ?
and by the way , we are now able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of the self that has experiences over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the self to remember , it &apos;s a totally different thing .
it &apos;s not about how someone &apos;s happy .
it &apos;s about how he <unk> a person when he thinks about his life .
a very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distinguish these concepts , is going to get confused at the study of happiness , and i belong to a group of masters of well @-@ being , who have been confused into the study of happiness for a long time because of it .
the distinction between the happiness of the self that has experiences and satisfaction from the self that remember has been recognized in the last few years , and currently it &apos;s trying to measure both .
the gallup organization does a world survey with over half a million people who have asked them a question about what they think of their life and their experiences , and there have been other <unk> in that sense .
so in the last few years , we &apos;ve started learning about the happiness of the two <unk> .
and the main lesson i think we &apos;ve learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can tell how excited someone is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t tell you great thing about whether they &apos;re living their lives in a happy way , and vice versa .
to give an idea of correlation , correlation is 0.5 .
which means that if you met someone , and they said , oh his father is six feet tall , how much do you know about his height ?
well , you know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
you still have a lot of uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone <unk> their life with eight on a scale of 10 , there &apos;s still a huge amount of uncertainty about how happy it is about the self that has experiences .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what controls the happiness of me .
we know money is very important , our goals are very important .
we know happiness is fundamentally being satisfied with all the people we like to be , spending time with the people we like .
there are other pleasures , but this is the dominant one .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two <unk> , you want to do very different things .
the conclusion of what i &apos;ve said here is that you really shouldn &apos;t think of happiness as a substitute for well @-@ being .
it &apos;s a completely different concept .
now , very quickly , another reason why we can &apos;t think carefully about happiness is that we don &apos;t pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we really live .
so , if you ask simply how happy california people are , you &apos;re not going to get an answer right .
when you ask that question , you think people should be happier in california than if you live in ohio , for example .
and what happens is when you think about life in california , you &apos;re thinking about the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast is , for example , climate .
well , it turns out climate is not very important for the me that has experiences and it &apos;s not even very important for me to think it &apos;s deciding how happy it is .
now , because the self that thinks back is the one who sends , you can end -- some people can end up saving california .
and it &apos;s interesting to discover what happens to people who move to california with the hope of being happier .
well , the self that has experiences is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but it &apos;s going to happen one thing . they &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because , when you think about it , you &apos;ll remember how awful it was in ohio , and you &apos;ll think they made the right decision .
it &apos;s very hard to think clearly about well @-@ being , and i hope to give you an idea of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you very much .
when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned there was a very interesting result that came out of the gallup poll .
is there something that can tell us , because there &apos;s still some time left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting outcome that we &apos;ve found in the gallup poll is a number , which is not meant to find at all .
we found that number with respect to the happiness of the self that has experiences .
when we look at how the feelings vary with income .
and it turns out , below about 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very big sample of americans , around 60,000 , is a representative sample significant , under the income of 600,000 dollars a year ...
60,000 60,000 60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 <unk> .
60,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re much more unhappy as poor they are .
but above that threshold , we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen very flat lines .
obviously what happens is that money does not buy the happiness of our experiences , but the lack of money with the lack of money produces the misery , and we can measure that misery very precisely .
in terms of the other self , the self that reminds , the story is different .
the more money you want the more content you want .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , the leading american challenge focuses on life , freedom and search for happiness .
if people take this statement seriously , it seems to me to reframe everything we believe about , say , the fiscal policy and issues like that .
is there any possibility that politicians , who the country in general , decided to take this very seriously and describe public policy based on it ?
<unk> : you know that i think there &apos;s a recognition of role in public policy .
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , there &apos;s no doubt about it , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s recognizing , and in other countries it &apos;s recognizing .
people recognize that they have to think about happiness when they think about public policy .
it &apos;s going to take time and people are going to debate whether they want to study the happiness of our experiences , or whether they want to study the <unk> of life , so we have to have that debate pretty soon .
how do you increase happiness , you see different ways depending on what you think and if you do it about the self that you remember or the self that has experiences .
that &apos;s going to influence public policy , i think , in the years ahead .
in the united states , it &apos;s trying to measure the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art happiness .
this will form , in the next decade or the next decade or so , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me , that this topic will be , or at least it should be , the most interesting political discussion in the next few years .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
thank you danny <unk>
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal , game designer .
i &apos;ve been doing online games for 10 years . my goal for the next decade is to try and make the world as easy to save the world in real life as it is in the world of online games .
and i have a plan to do that , and that &apos;s supposed to convince more people to come , spend more time playing bigger and better games .
today , we spend 3,000 billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you may be thinking , &quot; it &apos;s a lot of time to play games . &quot;
maybe too long , given the number of problems to solve in the real world .
but actually , according to my research , at the institute for <unk> actually the opposite happens .
three billion hours a week is not enough game time to solve the most intractable problems .
in fact , i think if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that radically .
i &apos;ve calculated the total need for 21 billion hours of play per week .
it &apos;s probably a slightly more intuitive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , that makes a dent . if we want to solve problems like : hunger , climate change , global conflict , obesity , i think we have to aspire to playing online at least 21 billion hours a week for the end of the next decade .
no , i really say .
here &apos;s why , this picture sums up a lot of why i think games are essential for the future survival of the human species . seriously .
this is a portrait of a photographer called phil morrison .
he wanted to capture the emotion of play , so he put a camera in front of the players while he was playing .
this is a classic emotion in games .
now , if you don &apos;t play , you &apos;ll get some nuances in this picture .
you probably see the sense of urgency maybe a little bit of fear , but intense concentration to tackle a really complex problem .
if you would play <unk> here some nuances , the guts of your eyes and around your mouth is a sign of optimism , and your eyebrows up is surprise .
this is a player about something called <unk> triumph .
you &apos;ve heard that . okay . okay . so there &apos;s players between us .
<unk> triumph is such an extraordinarily positive result that you didn &apos;t know it was possible until it made it .
i was almost beyond what you might think .
and when you get to that , you &apos;re surprised to discover what you were able . that &apos;s a saving triumph .
this is a player on the edge of a delusional triumph .
and this is the face that we need to see in millions of different kinds of problems all over the world as we &apos;re dealing with the obstacles of the next century , the face of someone who , against the whole bet , is at the edge of a winning triumph .
unfortunately , this is the face that we most see in everyday life when we try to address pressing problems .
this is what i call a face of &quot; i &apos;m not good in life . &quot; and this is me putting that face up . see it ? yes , good .
that &apos;s me putting a face of &quot; i &apos;m not good in life . &quot;
this is a graffiti graffiti in my former berkeley neighborhood , california , where i did my ph.d. from why we are better at games than in real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we feel we &apos;re not as good in reality as games .
and i &apos;m not just saying good in terms of success , even though it &apos;s part of that .
we get more in the worlds of games , but i also want to say good in terms of motivation to do something important that inspires and cooperate .
and when we &apos;re in the worlds of games , i think a lot of us get back to the best version of ourselves , the most willing to help , the toughest to follow with a problem that is necessary , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we fail , when we sacrifice obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re concerned , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing online , it just doesn &apos;t exist in games .
so i wanted to study when i was a ucla student .
what about games makes us feel -- there &apos;s nothing we can &apos;t accomplish ?
how can we take those feelings of the games -- and apply them to the work of the real world ?
so i &apos;m going to describe games like world of warcraft , which is really an ideal , collaborative resolution environment .
and i started looking at some things that make the success possible on online worlds .
the first thing is , whenever you get on one of these online games , especially in world of warcraft , there are lots and lots of different characters willing to immediately benefit from a mission that <unk> the world .
but not any mission , but a mission that <unk> perfectly with the current level of one in the game , right ?
so you can do it .
you never get a challenge you can &apos;t get .
but it &apos;s at the limits of what you &apos;re able to do , so you have to struggle , but there &apos;s no unemployment in world of warcraft .
there &apos;s no such thing to sit at hand -- there &apos;s always something specific and important to do .
and there &apos;s also a lot of collaborators .
wherever you go , there are hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to get your epic mission .
it &apos;s not something that we have in real life so easily this sense that in the palm of hand there is a lot of collaborators .
and there &apos;s also this epic story , this inspiring history of why we are there , what we &apos;re doing .
and then there &apos;s all that positive feedback .
you &apos;ve heard about raising levels and force + 1 , intelligence + 1 .
we don &apos;t have that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when i leave the stage , i &apos;m not going to give + 1 , crazy idea + 1 , or crazy idea , 20 + 20 .
i don &apos;t have that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with online collaborative settings like world of warcraft is that it &apos;s as satisfying to the edge of a commons , all the time we decided to spend all our time in these troubled worlds .
it &apos;s better than reality .
so far , all the world players of warcraft have spent millions of years solving the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might seem bad .
but to put it in context : millions of years ago , our human ancestors stood up .
that was the first primate range .
so when we talk about how much time we invest in online games , the only way that it makes sense to even think about it , is to talk about time in the magnitude of human evolution that &apos;s remarkable .
but it &apos;s a right thing . because it turns out that all this time playing online , we &apos;re actually changing what we &apos;re able to do as human beings .
we &apos;re evolving to be a more collaborative and ubiquitous type .
it &apos;s true . i believe this .
consider this really interesting statistic . it was published recently by a carnegie mellon researcher , the average young woman today in a country that has labeled game culture , there will be 10,000 hours playing online for the 21st years .
now , 10,000 hours is really an interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for american children , <unk> hours is the exact time that they will be in school from fifth grade to high school graduation from high school if they have perfect assistance .
so we have a whole parallel education path going on where young people learn so much about what you need to be a good player , as well as everything else in school .
many of you probably have read the new book by <unk> gladwell , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
you &apos;ve heard of his success theory of the success theory of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on this great research of cognitive science research that if we can get over 10,000 hours of biomedical study , in something for the age of 21 , we &apos;ll be planning on that .
we &apos;re going to be as good at what we &apos;re doing as the world &apos;s greatest person .
and now that we think about that , there &apos;s an entire generation of young people who are gamers to be able to do .
so the big question is , &quot; what are these players doing ? &quot;
because if we could know we would have something virtually unprecedented , these human resources in our hands .
that &apos;s how we now have a lot of people in the world who spend at least an hour playing online .
it &apos;s our gamers dancing . 500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion extremely good players in whatever .
if you don &apos;t know it already , it &apos;s coming .
the games industry is developing <unk> that burn little energy and work with wireless networks rather than the broadband internet so that the players of the particular world of india , china , brazil , can access .
they expect a billion more players in the next decade .
it will get us to 1.5 billion players .
so , i &apos;ve started thinking about , what these games are doing to us dancing .
here are the four things i found . the first is the urgent optimism .
well , think of this as an extreme self @-@ motivation car .
the urgent optimism is the desire to act immediately to deal with a mixed barrier to the belief that we have a reasonable success hope .
players always believe that it &apos;s possible a symbolic triumph and it &apos;s always worth trying , and doing so now .
they &apos;re not sitting there without doing anything .
players are <unk> <unk> the social plot .
there are lots of interesting research that show that we like most people after playing with them even if they &apos;ve been beat up .
and the reason is that it demands a lot of confidence playing a game with someone .
we can trust that they &apos;re going to spend their time with us that they &apos;re going to play under the same rules as the same goal , they &apos;re going to be on the game so far .
so playing a game together actually builds ties , trust and cooperation .
and as a result , we build stronger social relations .
productivity productivity . i love it .
there &apos;s a reason why the average world of warcraft plays 22 hours a week like a middle @-@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know that , when we play a game , we &apos;re actually happier working hard , relaxed or hanging out .
we know that we are self @-@ righteous , human beings , doing a significant job .
players are willing to work a lot of the time , if you give them the proper work .
finally , the daunting purpose .
players love impressive human history amazing human stories .
so , some data to put that in perspective . everyone knows wikipedia , the largest wiki in the world .
the second largest wiki in the world , with about 80,000 articles is the wiki of world of warcraft .
five million people use it a month .
there are more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other sub @-@ covered in any other wiki in the world .
they &apos;re building a epic story .
they &apos;re building a resource of condensed knowledge on world of warcraft .
well , these are four superpowers who are going to be one thing ; players are optimistic individuals with superpowers .
they are people who think they are capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is they think they &apos;re capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an economist called edward <unk> .
his job is brilliant . he studies why people spend so much time , energy , and money on online worlds .
and it says , &quot; we are seeing quantities -- not lower to massive <unk> -- to virtual worlds and online environments . &quot;
and it &apos;s an economist , and therefore rational .
and he says ...
not like me , i &apos;m a game designer , i &apos;m exuberant .
but he says that this has all the meaning because players can achieve more in virtual worlds than in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life . they have better feedback and they feel more rewarded in the games than in real life .
so he says that he now has the whole sense that players spend more time in virtual worlds than in the real world .
i also think that &apos;s rational , right now .
but it &apos;s not , in any way , an optimal situation .
we have to start doing the real world more like a game .
i was inspired by something that happened 2,500 years ago .
these are ancient dice , made out of sheep <unk> . right ?
before the fantastic tv controllers , we had <unk> .
and these represent the first game team designed by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the ancient greek historian <unk> , you know this story . it &apos;s the story of who and why he invented games .
<unk> says that games , in particular given , were invented in the kingdom of deals with for a famine period .
apparently there was such a severe famine that the king of deals decided they had to do something crazy .
people suffered . people suffered .
it was an extreme situation . they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to indyk , the games of the dice and a policy set up throughout the kingdom . one day , everybody would eat . and the next day , everybody was killed .
and they would be so <unk> in the start of dice because games are so attractive , and they dip into such <unk> productivity and <unk> the fact that we have great <unk> of <unk> .
and then the next day , we <unk> the day playing , and the other day we feed them .
and according to indyk , they lived 18 years like this , surviving famine on a day , playing the next day .
i think it &apos;s exactly the way games are used today .
we play to get away from the suffering of the real world .
we use games to get rid of everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , all we don &apos;t get tired of the real world and take what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is very exciting .
according to <unk> , after 18 years famine had not been killed , so the king decided to start a end of dice .
we wanted to divide into two parts the entire kingdom .
they played a game by dice and the winners of the game play will go into a epic adventure .
they &apos;re going to leave , and they &apos;re going to look for a new home , leaving long enough people to survive with the resources available , and hopefully to bring civilization to some place where they could thrive .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , evidence of dna has shown that <unk> that migrating into the roman empire actually shared the same dna with the old <unk> .
and therefore , recently , scientists have suggested that the mad history of <unk> is true .
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted about 20 years , which would explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
they could have really saved their culture playing games for 18 years and then as inspired as they knew as much as leaving together with games that really saved the civilization in this way .
well , we can do that .
we &apos;ve played warcraft since 1994 .
it was the first strategy game in real time of the world series of warcraft . that was 16 years ago .
so , given for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
they had half the civilization to be looking for a new world . that &apos;s where i have my 21 billion hours a week of games .
we half of ourselves spend an hour a day playing games to solve real world problems .
i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve spent my work in the last few years at the institute for <unk> .
we have this poster in our front office and expresses our view of how we should relate to the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the result of the best scenario in a case , and then we encourage people to make reality that outcome .
we want to imagine <unk> wins , and then we want to give people the means to make <unk> gains .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i &apos;ve made that they &apos;re an attempt to give people the media to create <unk> gains in their future .
this is &quot; star <unk> . &quot;
we did this game in 2007 .
this is an online game where you &apos;re trying to survive an oil droplet .
oil <unk> is <unk> , but we put enough online content there to create that it &apos;s true and live their real lives as if it &apos;s finished oil . so , when you get in the game , they tell us where they live , and then we get to real data sources that show exactly how long it costs , how long it costs to live , how it affects the transportation supply , and then it &apos;s going to figure out how to know how it &apos;s going to work .
we did a players in 2007 , and we followed them for three years .
and i can tell you it &apos;s a transformative experience .
no one wants to change the way of life just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to do it .
but if you immerse them in a epic adventure and says , &quot; we are left without oil . &quot;
this is an amazing story and an adventure to help you out .
tell yourself to survive in that world . a lot of players have been keeping their habits in this game .
so for the next game that we looked at the world , we decided to aim higher , a bigger problem for oil .
we did a game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the institute for <unk> .
the premise was that a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer is called the world @-@ extinction system , of course .
we asked people to build online , almost like a jerry <unk> movie .
you know , in the movies of jerry <unk> , they form an ideal team ; they have the astronaut , the scientist , former <unk> , everybody has something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people in the ideal team , we said , they &apos;re all in the ideal team , and it &apos;s your goal to invent the future of energy , the future of food , health , the future of security and the social security network .
we did play 8,000 people that game for eight weeks .
there were 500 creative biomedical solutions that can go in and see if it &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
finally , the last game . we &apos;re launching march 3 . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you end the game , you will be certified by the institute of world bank , as social innovative , class 2010 .
working with the universities of all sub @-@ saharan africa , and we &apos;re trained to learn social innovation skills .
we have a graphic novel . we have <unk> in skills like local knowledge , networks of knowledge , sustainability , vision and invention .
i would like to invite all of you to share , please , this game with young people from all over the world , in particular areas of development who could benefit from the union to try to start imagining their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to challenge you now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think it &apos;s going to happen next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have all these games that are pilots that could be done , but none of them have saved the real world .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are a human resource we can use in real world jobs that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these <unk> superpowers , the ability to spin a solid social plot , this feeling of urgent optimism , and the desire of the <unk> purpose .
i really hope that together we can play games that we play , to survive another century on this planet .
and i hope you join me and play games like this .
when i look at the next decade , i know two things with security : that we can make any future we imagine , and we can play all kinds of games that we hate .
so i say , let &apos;s start the games that change the world .
thank you .
i would like to share with you a discovery i made a few months while i was writing an article for the italian editing of wired magazine .
i always have my hand @-@ <unk> dictionary when i &apos;m writing something , but i &apos;d finished editing my article when i realized that i never in my life had looked for the word &quot; disabled &quot; to see what .
let me just read you what it says .
&quot; disabled , &quot; <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , helpless , destroyed , <unk> , injured , injured , traumatized , maimed , maimed , traumatized , haunted , haunted , haunted , poison , poison , poison , <unk> , <unk> , sick , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , falling out of nerves , dead , too , and weak .
lean , healthy , strong , able . &quot;
i was reading this in a high @-@ voice to a friend , and at first i was laughing , i was so ridiculous , but i just had to read &quot; smashed , &quot; when my voice had collapsed and had to stop and get rid of the emotional crash and the impact that these crazy words <unk> .
you know , of course , this was my old and old @-@ fashioned -- i thought i had to be an old , clear editing .
but , in fact , it was an issue of early &apos; 80s when i was going to be starting elementary school and i had an idea of myself outside the family core and relationship to the other kids and the world around me .
and , needless to say , thank god i didn &apos;t use a <unk> at that time .
i mean , according to this definition , it seems like i was born in a world that would remind someone like me to have absolutely no positive to give , when , in fact , i &apos;m currently elected for the opportunities and adventures that my life has brought me .
so , immediately i was looking at the online edition of 2009 , waiting to find a decent review to be considered .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this word .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; particularly <unk> , &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just a question of words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we talk about them with these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we built those values .
our language affects our way of thinking and how we see the world , and how we see other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the greeks and roman , believed that the <unk> were very powerful , because he <unk> out loud .
so what is the reality that we want to create , the one person that is limited , or the one person who has control itself ?
just by the mere fact of doing something as simple as a name of a person , a child , we could be transparent and enveloping their ability .
wouldn &apos;t we want , instead , open doors ?
a person like that , who opened my door , was my childhood doctor at the institute , <unk> , <unk> .
his name is dr. <unk> . an american of italian origin , whose name apparently was too difficult to pronounce for most of his fellow americans , so he would make him hate dr. p.
and p , dr. always wore very colorful <unk> and he had the perfect fitness to work with kids .
i enjoyed most of the time i spent in the hospital , with exception of my sessions .
i had to do what appeared to me with countless <unk> <unk> on these thick rubber bands -- different colors -- you know , to help strengthen my leg muscles , and i hate these gangs more than anything else . i hated them , i hated them . i hated them .
and , you know , i was already there , with only five years of age , with dr. p to try and stop doing these <unk> , no success , of course .
and one day , she came to my session -- <unk> and <unk> , and she said , &quot; oh , aimee , you &apos;re such a tough , so potent , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those bands .
when i unfold it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple <unk> part of dr. p for achieving the exercises that i didn &apos;t want to make before the possibility of being the five @-@ year @-@ old girl in the second floor room , but what he actually did for me was to transform a daily event that was horrible in a very good experience for me .
and i have to ask myself today , how far your vision is , and having kicked a strong , powerful child , shaped my view of myself in the future as a strong , powerful person and athletic .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can turn the energy of a child .
however , in the definitions of the <unk> that we previously saw , our language does not allow us to develop into the reality that we all want , the possibility that one person can see itself as capable .
our language has not been put on the day with changes in our society , many of which have been caused by technology .
certainly , from a medical perspective , my legs , laser surgery to improve vision , knee @-@ prosthetic devices and hip @-@ made titanium @-@ based titanium <unk> , all of which are allowing people to develop more their schools , and move beyond their own borders that nature has imposed them , not to mention the social networking platforms , which allows people to create their own communities to create their own choices that allow them to create their own choices that they can do with choice of their own choices that they can do with the choices
so , maybe the technology is giving us now more clearly what has always been a truth , that each person has a little bit of common and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adapt is the biggest advantage we have .
the human ability to adapt , which is an interesting thing , because people have constantly wanted to talk to me about overcoming the odds , and i &apos;m going to admit something . that phrase never stuck with me , and i always felt uncomfortable trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m beginning to realize why .
in this particular phrase of <unk> , there is the idea that success , or happiness , is going through a <unk> challenge or not being affected by the experience , as if my successes in life were the result of a ability to fight or to <unk> the difficulties in a lifetime that other people perceive as my disability .
however , in fact , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re affected , of course , by a challenge , be physical , emotionally , or in both ways .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
adversity is not a barrier that we need to be surrounded to be able to take our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of this as being my shadow .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and certainly , i &apos;m not trying to minimize the impact , weight , the fight of a person .
there are adversity and challenges in life , and it &apos;s a different reality for every person , but the thing isn &apos;t whether you &apos;re going or not having to face adversity , but how you &apos;re going to face it .
so , our responsibility is not simply to isolate the adversity from those who we want , but to make sure that we want it to do well .
and we don &apos;t do any favor of our children when we make them feel they &apos;re not equipped to adapt .
there &apos;s an important difference between the objective medical fact that i have the right legs and the subjective opinion of society about whether i am or not disabled .
and frankly , the only real and consistent disability that i &apos;ve had to deal with is that the world would think those definitions describe me .
in our desire to protect those who we love giving them the hard and cold truth about their medical forecast or a forecast of the quality of life that they might expect , we should make sure that we don &apos;t put the first brick into a wall that ultimately <unk> someone .
maybe the existing model of just looking at what &apos;s damaged in you and how to fix it , causes the most disability that pathology in itself .
when we &apos;re not treating the person in their totality , by not recognizing their potential , we &apos;re creating another bad fight on any natural struggle that can already have .
we &apos;re putting a score on the value that someone has for our community .
so we need to look beyond pathology and within the range of human capacity .
and more importantly , there &apos;s a partnership between those <unk> and our greatest creative skill .
so it &apos;s not about underestimate , or deny , those moments of greater evidence as something we want to avoid or hide , but rather than that , it &apos;s about finding those opportunities that are hidden inside of adversity .
so , maybe , the idea i want to express is , not so much the <unk> , but the <unk> of it , the <unk> , the <unk> with it , to use a term of the professional struggle , perhaps even engage with it .
and perhaps , if we look at adversity as a natural , consistent and useful , we &apos;ll be less for their presence .
this year we celebrate the 200 years of the birth of charles darwin , and 150 years ago , when he was writing about evolution , darwin started a manifest , i think , a truth about the character of human beings .
to celebrate it , it &apos;s not the strongest of the species that survives , nor is it the smartest of the one who survives , but also the one that fits better in change .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , among others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and thrive is propelled by the fight of the human spirit through conflict and towards transformation .
so again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human ability .
and maybe it &apos;s not until we &apos;re biased , that we know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe this is what adversity gives us , a sense of self @-@ itself , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give us a gift .
we can rethink adversity as something more than just difficult times .
maybe we can see it as a change .
adversity is just a change that we haven &apos;t yet adapted to .
i think the greatest adversity that we &apos;ve created is the idea of normal .
tell me , who is normal ?
there is no normal .
there &apos;s the common . there &apos;s the usual . there &apos;s no normal thing . and , would you want to meet those poor people , poor people , <unk> color , if they exist ?
i don &apos;t think .
if we can change this paradigm and move from one that looks for the normal to another possibility , or the strength , to be a little more risky , we can release the power of so many other children , and invite them to service the service of the community those strange and valuable skills that they own .
anthropologists tell us that , as humans , we &apos;ve always been looking at members of our community is that they are useful , that they are able to contribute .
there &apos;s evidence that neanderthals , 60,000 years ago , will attract their elderly , and those with severe physical lesions , perhaps because the experience of survival in the life of these people proved to be value for the community .
they didn &apos;t see these people as being damaged or useless ; they looked at them as unusual and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the village where i grew up in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing in front of a commodity pack .
it was summer . i had a few short pants .
i hear this man talking behind me saying , &quot; well , if this is not aimee . &quot;
and i turn around , and this old man , i have no idea who he is .
and i say , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , do we know ? i don &apos;t remember . &quot;
and he says , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think you remember when i met .
i mean , when we met , it was washed off the belly of your mother . &quot;
oh , that person .
and of course , i realized there .
i was dr. <unk> , who i knew only through the stories that my mother would tell me about that day , because , of course , as he &apos;s normally in me , i came two weeks later to my birth .
so my mother &apos;s <unk> had gone on holiday , so the man who made my birth was a complete stranger for my parents .
and , since i was born without the bones of the <unk> , and i had the feet <unk> into the inside , and a few fingers on this foot , and a few in this other , he had to be who &apos;s carrying , this strange guy had to be the bad news .
he said , &quot; i had to give you the forecast to your parents that you would never forget , and that you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids had or any kind of independent life , and you &apos;ve been like a liar from that moment . &quot;
the amazing thing is , he told me that he had been keeping newspaper cuts throughout my childhood , whether outside of when i won a competition to spell in second grade , supported by the <unk> , you know , at the <unk> institute , when i won my university scholarship , or any of my trainer &apos;s books , and he used this material , and he encouraged his classes with the medical care .
and he called this part of the course of the x , the potential of the human will .
no forecast can determine how powerful this can be as a <unk> of the quality of one person &apos;s life .
and dr. <unk> kept telling me , &quot; in my experience , unless you give it a lot of times the opposite , and even if you just give it a very minimal support , if you let it sink , a child will achieve success . &quot;
you see , dr. <unk> made that change of thought .
he understood that there is a difference between the health problem and what a person can do despite the same .
and i myself have changed my way of thinking with time , because if you had asked me when i was 15 years old , if i would have changed my legs for beef and bone , i would not have <unk> or for a second .
and at that time , he was facing that kind of normal .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences that i &apos;ve had with them , not despite the experiences that i &apos;ve had with them .
and perhaps , this change in my mind has occurred because i &apos;ve been in contact with more people who have been open doors to me than those who have put <unk> and shadows on me .
you know , all you need is a person who opens your eyes to your own power , and you take off .
if you could give someone the key to their own power , the human spirit is so <unk> , if you could do that and open up a door for someone in a pivotal moment , you &apos;re <unk> in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching yourself to open doors .
in fact , the exact meaning of the english word &quot; <unk> &quot; comes from the root &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means , stimulate what &apos;s inside , manifest the potential .
so again , what is the potential that we want to map ?
a case study was done in britain , in the 1960s , when the system was changing the income system at high school , one that required income test another that was open .
that &apos;s called the evidence of separation in groups . here in the united states , we call it <unk> .
it &apos;s about separating students from a , b , c , etc .
and the students a get the most difficult curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took high school students , and for a three @-@ month period , they gave them the highest notes , they told them that they were high @-@ level students , they told them they were brilliant , and at the end of that three @-@ month period , they were <unk> at an a.
and of course , the heartbreaking <unk> of this study is that they took students from level a , and they told them they were level @-@ d.
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three @-@ month period .
with those who were still in school , amongst those who had already left .
one crucial part of this case study was that teachers were also deceived .
teachers didn &apos;t know that a change had been done .
they just told them that these were the students a , and these were the students &apos; d. &apos; and that &apos;s how students were taught and taught .
so , i think the only real disability is a <unk> spirit , a spirit that has been <unk> has no hope . it doesn &apos;t see beauty . it &apos;s no more our natural curiosity , child and our innate ability to imagine .
if , instead , we can <unk> a human spirit to have hope , to see beauty in itself and others , so it &apos;s imaginative and curious , then we &apos;re really using our power .
when a spirit has these qualities , we &apos;re able to create new realities and new ways of being .
i would like to leave you with a poem by an persian poet in the 17th century , named <unk> of who told me my friend , jacques <unk> . and the poem is called &quot; god who only knows four <unk> . &quot; every child has known god , not the god of the different names , not the god of what you can &apos;t do , but the god knows that four words have .
come up and dance with me . thank you .
would you like to be better than they are ?
suppose i told you that , with only a few changes in your genes , they could improve your memory -- more accurate , more accurate and faster .
or maybe they would like to be better shape , to be stronger , to have more resilience .
would you like to be more attractive and confident ?
how about living with good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re from those people who always wanted to be more creative .
what else would you like ?
what would you like , if you could choose something ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
hands up . let me see .
few . probably the number of creative people around .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose the memory ?
a few more .
and the physical state ?
a little less .
how about longevity ?
oh , most . that makes me feel very good as a doctor .
if you could have some of this , the world would be very different .
is it just imagination ?
or maybe it &apos;s possible ?
evolution has been a theme here at the ted conference , but today i want to look at a physician on the subject .
the great 20th @-@ century male and <unk> <unk> , who also <unk> in the most unorthodox church , wrote an essay called &quot; nothing in biology has felt safe to the light of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re from those people who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a good time to turn off the hearing aids , throwing out personal communication devices on it , and maybe , let &apos;s have the book of <unk> on being wrong , because , none of the rest of this talk is going to make a very much sense for you .
but if you really accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just the past , or the future ?
does others like us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in that picture , i put a bush in which the center has collapsed throughout directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , each existing species on the back of those branches has been successful in evolutionary terms : it has survived ; it has shown an adaptation to its environment .
the human part of this branch , well at one end , of course , the most interesting thing to us .
it came from a common ancestry with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
at the time , there have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some have gone and back .
we &apos;ve been here for a few years .
it may seem that we &apos;re very far from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same .
do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the insulin protein that &apos;s used to treat diabetes ?
this is not like human insulin ; it &apos;s the same protein , it &apos;s chemically <unk> , out of the pancreas .
and talking about bacteria -- do you realize we all carry in the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body ?
maybe 10 times more .
i mean , think -- when antonio <unk> asks them what the self @-@ image -- do you think about bacteria ?
the gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , dark , rain , very <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to provide all the nutrients that they can want without effort on their part .
it really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional <unk> of some rush to the output .
but , on the other hand , we &apos;re a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life .
they help digest essential nutrients , and they protect us from certain diseases .
but what &apos;s wrong with us ?
are we in a sort of evolutionary equilibrium like a species ?
or should it be destined to become something different , something maybe better adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s take a step back in time , the big bang , 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of proto @-@ life may appear three to four billion years ago in the <unk> , the first <unk> organisms , maybe about 800 to 1,000 million years ago , and then the human species that appears in the last world .
in this vast <unk> symphony of the universe , life on earth is like a brief compass ; the animal kingdom , like one and only <unk> , and human life , a little note of grace .
that was us .
and it was also the neat part of this talk , so i hope you enjoyed it .
when i first got to college , i had my first biology class .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something fundamental : most of the existence of life , on single @-@ celled organisms , each cell just divides and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted by the two daughters .
but when the cells appear , things start to change .
it comes into sexual reproduction .
and a very important thing : the emergence of sexual reproduction that occurs the genome , the rest of the body becomes <unk> .
in fact , you could say that the body &apos;s death <unk> enters evolution in the same time of sexual reproduction .
i have to claim that when i was a college student , i thought , well , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex ; it seemed quite reasonable at that time , but every year i &apos;d spent , every time i had more self @-@ doubts .
i came to understand the feelings of george burns , which was still grounded in vegas well in his 90s .
and one night , someone grabs his hotel door .
he opens the door .
in front of him , he finds a very ugly dancer from his clothes .
he looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m looking for a sex soup . &quot;
&quot; okay , &quot; george says , &quot; i pick the soup . &quot;
i realized , as a doctor , who was working for a different goal to the goal of evolution -- not necessarily counterintuitive , just different .
i was trying to preserve the body .
i wanted us to be healthy .
i wanted to get health from disease .
i wanted us to live more and healthier .
evolution consists of passing the genome to the next generation -- doubling and generation after generation .
from an evolutionary point of view , you and i are sort of like strengthening rockets designed to send the genetics to the next mars level and then let us fall to the sea .
i think everyone <unk> the feeling that woody allen when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to achieve immortality through my work .
i want to make them not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily help longevity .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily help the bigger or the louder or the faster and not even the smartest .
evolution favors the best @-@ adapted creatures into their environment .
that &apos;s the only proof of survival and success .
at the bottom of the ocean , the pathogenic bacteria that can survive the heat of the sub @-@ parts that they would make , if there were fish there , fish there , <unk> medicine , but they &apos;ve managed to make that a <unk> environment .
so , what that means , when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and , in particular , if we look forward to the next phase -- i would say there &apos;s a lot of possibilities .
the first is they don &apos;t burn .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine , first of all , we &apos;ve been able to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise have been <unk> and removed from the population .
and second , as a species , we have <unk> our environment so we can adapt to ourselves as well as we adapt to it .
and by the way , <unk> , <unk> , and we get so excited that it &apos;s no longer possible to have the isolation necessary to make evolution happen .
a second possibility is that there is an evolution of the traditional , natural type , dictated by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be : the gears of evolution roll it slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and as soon as the isolation : when as a sort of donor planets are going to exist , the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , intriguing and terrifying possibility .
i call it the &quot; neo @-@ evolution , &quot; the new evolution , which is not just natural -- but selected for us as individuals in the decisions we &apos;re going to make .
now , how could this happen ?
how could we get to do this ?
first , consider the reality that many people today , in some cultures , are making decisions about their offspring .
in some cultures , they &apos;re choosing to have more boys than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily a good thing for society , but it &apos;s what choice at the individual level and family level .
think also , if it were possible to choose not only the sex of their offspring , but in their own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease .
what if we could make genetic changes to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or decrease the risk of cancer or eliminating <unk> ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
if you look into the future , that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost <unk> million dollars .
the next year of being done , in 2004 , i could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months .
today , you can get a complete sequence of the 3,000 million base pairs of the human genome at a cost near the $ 20,000 and in a week .
don &apos;t make a lot of money to actually make the human genome for 1,000 dollars , and it will be more and more in the grasp of everyone .
just a week ago , the national academy of engineering issued his nobel prize <unk> to francis arnold and <unk> , two scientists who developed innovative techniques in an independent way to make the evolutionary process work faster and adapt to protein in a much more efficient way -- what <unk> arnold calls &quot; evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the <unk> prize was awarded the scientific <unk> by their research in which he took an adult skin cell , a <unk> , and only four genes attached to that cell to become a <unk> stem cell : a cell capable , potentially any cell in the body .
those changes come .
the same technology that &apos;s produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves , but they &apos;re going to induce other viruses .
believe it or there is no experimental trial underway with the flu vaccine versus influenza in cells from a tobacco plant .
can you imagine a good thing coming out of tobacco ?
that &apos;s actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible .
so imagine just another two small changes .
they can change the cells in their bodies , but if they could change their offspring cells ?
what if they could change sperm and <unk> or change the newly <unk> , and give their kids a better chance of a healthier life , eliminate diabetes , cutting out the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier kids ?
and then , that same analytical technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to adopt super @-@ enabling attributes -- a better memory .
why not have the wit of a ken jennings sitting especially if you could hit the next generation of watson ?
why don &apos;t we have a <unk> muscle faster than we can run faster and faster ?
why not live longer ?
this is going to be freaky .
and when we &apos;re under conditions of navigating this to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to turn the evolution of before in the neocortex .
we &apos;re going to take a process that could usually take 100 thousand years and we could give 1,000 years to maybe happen in the next 100 years .
these are choices that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have them .
are we going to use these choices in terms of a better , more successful , more successful society ?
or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for others ?
are we going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust ?
this is the kind of question we &apos;re going to have to face .
and most profound of all , are we going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these choices wisely ?
for good or for bad , and before you might think about it , these choices are going to rely on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine a robot that can be taken and gives <unk> skills or whatever makes wheelchair users come up and walk again .
in <unk> , we call these robots , <unk> .
they &apos;re nothing different than something you put in the morning , it gives a big force , which also increases its velocity , and helps him , for example , to manage balance .
it &apos;s actually true integration of man and machine .
but not only that -- it can integrate and connecting it to the universe and with other things outside .
this is not an unreal idea .
so to show you now what we &apos;re working on to talk about the american soldier , on average , has to carry on his back a 45 @-@ pound load , and he &apos;s still getting more equipment .
obviously , this leads to some very important complications -- lesions in the back , 30 percent of soldiers -- with <unk> damage .
we decided to contemplate this challenge and create a <unk> that could help deal with the issue .
let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or the human <unk> .
soldiers : with the <unk> , i can save 40 pounds of terrain for many hours .
its flexible design , it allows you to take a lot of <unk> and perform movement with big agility .
it feels what i want to do , or where i want to go , and then it increases my strength and my resistance .
we &apos;re ready , with our industrial partner , to produce this device , this new <unk> , this year .
i mean , it &apos;s a reality .
let &apos;s go back to the wheelchair users , which i feel particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people around , in wheelchair chairs , around the world .
about one percent of the total population .
and this is a really conservative calculation .
we talk about something that often happens , very young people , with damage to the column that when they start their lives -- 20 , 30 or 40 years old -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice .
we also talk about the aging population that sped up very quickly .
his only choice , many times -- because of a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair .
and this has been the case for the last 500 years , from its successful emergence , as i should recognize .
so we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility .
let me introduce you to the <unk> that &apos;s using amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had a lesion in the column , and as a result he couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years , until now .
thank you .
so amanda is using our <unk> , which mentioned .
it has a few sensors .
completely non @-@ invasive on the crutches that send signals to the computer on board , here on the back .
there are also some batteries that give energy to the engines on the hip , and on the knees , and make it move forward with this smooth , very natural gait .
i was 24 years old at the top of my life when , for a strange jump in the air , skiing is still paralyzed .
in a fraction of a second , i lost all of the sensations moving down .
shortly after that , a doctor walked into my room in the hospital , and he said , &quot; amanda , never cease to walk . &quot;
that happened 19 years ago .
so he robbed me up to the last grain of hope for me .
the <unk> technology since then has allowed me to learn how to behave underwater is actually downhill , climbing rocks and even ride a hand bike .
but they haven &apos;t invented anything that lets me walk , so far .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms for sitting and talking to you .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just soldiers , but amanda , and all wheelchair users , everyone .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m responsible for developing a non @-@ profit organization called robin <unk> .
when i &apos;m not fighting poverty , i &apos;m fighting fires as a captain &apos;s office in a volunteer fire .
and in our city , where volunteers have trained a highly skilled staff , you have to get to the fire site very soon enough to get in action .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the site , so i had a fairly high probability of going .
but there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and find out what our task was .
when i found the captain , i was <unk> in a conversation with the owner who surely passed one of the worst days of his life .
we were in the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , and her house was on fire .
the other volunteer who had just arrived before i , <unk> <unk> <unk> came first to the captain and he asked her to support the dog of the house .
the dog ! i was so <unk> !
there was a lawyer or <unk> of money that , for the rest of his life , he would have to tell the people who walked into a burning building to save a single living , because he won me for five seconds .
well , i was the following .
the captain made me a <unk> .
he said , &quot; noah , i need to get to the house .
i need you to come up , grab the fire , and i bring this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
it wasn &apos;t exactly what i expected but i went -- i put up the stairs , at the end of the hall , i went to the real fire that at the very height or so they had just finished turning the fire and going into the main room for a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i took my burden back up the ladder where i met my <unk> and the lovely dog at the front door .
we took out of the house , the <unk> for the owner of the house where , as was to wait , his treasure , he got much more attention than mine .
a few weeks later , the department received a letter from the owner of the house <unk> by the fearless courageous effort to save his house .
the kindness she &apos;s observing for the other things was that someone had even reached a pair of shoes .
both in my firm at robin <unk> , like in my quest as a volunteer , i witnessed acts of generosity and kindness in a monumental scale , but also of acts of grace and individual courage to the individual level .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
everything has its importance .
so , when i look in this room to people who have managed , or are for achieving , remarkable success levels , i would like to remind you this : no wait .
don &apos;t wait to win the first million to make a difference in someone &apos;s life .
if they have something to give , we will understand now .
we planted food in a dining hall , we planted a neighborhood park .
be mentors .
not every day we &apos;re going to have a chance to save someone &apos;s life , but every day we &apos;re going to be able to influence someone &apos;s life .
so , go into the game . save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival .
it &apos;s a place where women have the baton , practice sex to say hello , and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious .
and no , it &apos;s not the hot man or san francisco festival .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
this is the world of the wild bonobos ?
bonobos are , along with chimpanzees , their closest living relatives .
that means we all share a common ancestry , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their aggression .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve made too much focus on this aspect of human evolution .
but the bonobos now show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees are dominated by large , terrifying guys , the bonobo is in charge of females with power .
these guys have created something special , because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence is still not seen .
but unfortunately , the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes .
they live in the deep sea of the rainforest , and it &apos;s been very difficult to study them .
the congo is a paradox -- a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the <unk> itself -- stage of a violent conflict that has largely taken by decades and causes almost as many deaths as the first world war .
no wonder that this destruction also <unk> the survival of the bonobo .
the trade of hunting and deforestation trade makes it not swim or a stadium with the bonobos that remain in the world -- and honestly , we &apos;re not sure about it .
however , on this land of violence and chaos , you can hear something unseen the trees .
who are these cousins ?
we know them as the apes , do love , not war , because they have frequent sex , <unk> and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems .
i &apos;m not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of mankind , because life of the bonobo is more than <unk> .
the bonobos , like humans , love playing throughout their lifetime .
playing is not just a boys &apos; game .
for us , and for them , play is fundamental to create links and to encourage tolerance .
we learn to trust him , and we learn the rules of play .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it has to do with the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you look at the bonobo , you see the evolutionary roots of laughter and dance and human ritual .
the game is the glue that binds us .
i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique videos taken from the wild .
first , it &apos;s a bonobo @-@ name game ; i don &apos;t talk about football .
here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a chase .
look what she &apos;s doing .
it could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , &quot; he has caught it in the balls . &quot;
i just think in this case he loves him , right ?
yes .
so sexual play is both common with bonobos and human .
and this video really is interesting because it shows -- this video really is interesting because it shows the footage of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> -- and at the same time it &apos;s all fun .
but play is transformational .
the game is <unk> , it can adopt many forms , some of which are most <unk> , <unk> , weird -- maybe the place where you get to wonder .
and i want you to see -- this is <unk> , a young female , who is playing with unhealthy water .
i think , as she , we sometimes play alone , and explore the boundaries of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s that playful curiosity that pushes us to explore , to interact , and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity .
these are just little samples of the understanding that bonobos give us of our past and present .
but they also have a secret to our future , a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with creativity and greater cooperation .
the secret is that play is the key to these capabilities .
in other words , play is our <unk> of adaptation .
to successfully adapt to a world that changes we have to play .
but do we really enjoy our game capacity ?
play is not <unk> .
play is essential .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just cruel and wasteful .
when it seems the least appropriate to play , it can be the moments where it &apos;s most urgent .
so , our primates , let &apos;s accept this gift of evolution and play together while preserving creativity , friendship and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two partners in 1979 , the same day , exactly at the same time , each baby <unk> . okay .
so , two couples each with a baby .
i don &apos;t want you to be arrested too much in the details of conception , because if you stop thinking about conception in one , they don &apos;t pay attention to me .
let &apos;s think about that for a moment .
and on this stage , i want you to imagine that , in a case , the sex chromosome joins the x @-@ chromosome .
and in the other case , the x chromosome of sperm comes together to the x @-@ chromosome .
both <unk> and life begins .
we &apos;ll come back and talk about them later .
in my field , i play two roles .
in one of my role , i work with the history of the anatomy .
i &apos;m <unk> by training and what i study in this case is the way that people are <unk> the anatomy -- which is that , from human bodies and <unk> , how they have regarded body fluids , the idea of the body , what they &apos;ve thought about the body .
the other role that performance in my work is the activist , as <unk> of patients or , as i say sometimes , <unk> of people who are medical patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people whose physical features challenging social norms .
i &apos;ve been working , for example , with identical twins , two people inside one body .
i &apos;ve been working with people with <unk> -- much lower people than half .
and i &apos;ve worked with many cases of people with sex , individuals whose physical <unk> does not fit into male and conventional female schemes .
in general lines , we can confirm them .
it takes many forms .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of ways to have sex that doesn &apos;t fit into the mainstream or female forms .
for example , there &apos;s the case of the individual who has been <unk> , whose gene <unk> from the y chromosome , says to the <unk> , which we all have in plain life , have testicles .
and then , in <unk> life , testicles produce testosterone .
but because this individual lacks testosterone receptors , the body does not react to the same .
it &apos;s <unk> &apos;s syndrome .
so , there are high levels of testosterone , but no reaction .
as a consequence , the body is developing a typically female course .
when the baby &apos;s born , the baby looks like a child .
he &apos;s a girl . he &apos;s raised as a child .
and often , it &apos;s not even until puberty , when it &apos;s growing and developing breasts , but it doesn &apos;t have the <unk> period , when someone tells you something is happening .
then , after doing tests , they realize that instead of having ovaries and a uterus , it actually has testicles and a y.
the important thing to understand is that you can think it &apos;s a man , but it really isn &apos;t .
women , like men , have in the body something called <unk> silk .
they &apos;re in the back of the body .
<unk> silk glands produce <unk> , the <unk> hormone .
most women like me -- i consider a typical woman ; she doesn &apos;t know her structure <unk> ; i think to be a typical woman , most women like me are sensitive to <unk> .
we make <unk> and we respond to <unk> .
as a consequence , someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who has <unk> syndrome to the <unk> .
so sex is a complicated thing . it &apos;s not that <unk> are in the middle of the spectrum -- they can somehow be everywhere .
another example : a few years ago , i received a call from a 19 @-@ year @-@ old boy who was born and raised as a male child , and he had sex with her , he had a life as a child , and he had just discovered that he had ovaries and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> .
he had 20th chromosomes , and in the womb , <unk> silk glands were so active that , essentially , created a male hormone environment .
as a consequence , his <unk> were swollen , his brain was exposed to the normal hormone component .
he was born as a child . no one was <unk> .
and it was at 19 years when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> , when doctors discovered that , in fact , he was a woman inside .
well , another quick example of a <unk> case .
some people with 20th chromosomes develop what &apos;s known as <unk> , which means they have tissue embedded in knitting .
we don &apos;t know why that happens .
so , there are many varieties of sex .
the reason that children with this kind of bodies -- so it &apos;s dwarfs , <unk> twins , or <unk> , are sent to <unk> surgery , is not to be able to get rid of better physical health .
in many cases , people are perfectly healthy .
the reason for various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories .
the system is typically based on the idea that a particular anatomy carries a particular identity .
we have the idea that being a woman is having female identity ; supposedly , being black means having african anatomy in historical terms .
a terribly simplistic idea .
and when we have a body that shows something quite different , we have problems with <unk> .
so we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk> .
our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> .
imagine how amazing it is to have children born like two people in one body .
the recent highest case is last year in south african south african south african south african south african south african <unk> ; it was put in the <unk> of his sex in the international berlin wall .
a lot of reporters called to ask , &quot; what &apos;s the test they &apos;re going to do to determine whether it &apos;s a man or a woman ? &quot;
and i had to tell the journalists that there &apos;s no such test .
in fact , we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn &apos;t trace a <unk> line between men and women and men and <unk> and women and <unk> ; we &apos;re the ones who draw that line .
so , what we have is a situation where the further the science goes up , the more we have to admit that these categories -- that we thought were very stable trauma categories that were directly linked with stable categories -- are much more systematic than we thought .
and not only in terms of sex .
also in terms of race , which is much more complicated than the terminology allows .
as we see , we get into rough terrain .
let &apos;s look , for example , the fact that we share at least 95 percent of dna with chimpanzees .
what about the fact that they trusted them in just a few <unk> ?
and as we move deeper into science , we get more and more into a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that we probably are too <unk> .
and we &apos;re looking at this in all walks of human life .
one of them , for example , in our current culture , in the united states today , are the struggle at the beginning and at the end of life .
it &apos;s hard to fix a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the fetus .
there are very industrious discussions today -- not in public , but in the <unk> of when someone is being considered dead .
our ancestors never had to marry this question of whether someone was dead .
as a lot they put a feather in front of his nose , and if he was still <unk> him .
if he stopped moving the air .
but we can , for example , extract vital organs from one body and put them in another body .
and as a consequence , we have to deal with the dilemma of actually tell someone &apos;s death , and it puts us in a difficult situation where we don &apos;t have the simple categories of the past .
and you may think that this supernova explosion could lead someone like me .
in politics , i &apos;m progressive , people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit that it makes me nervous .
to highlight these categories , they &apos;re much more insane than we thought i was tense .
closed from the standpoint of the concept of democracy .
and to tell you about this tension first , i have to admit that i &apos;m a <unk> of the founding fathers .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were big .
i mean , they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did , which i find each time looking at that orange piece of music , not because of music , which is totally <unk> .
it &apos;s why it happened in <unk> with the founding fathers .
founding fathers were , for me , the first activists of the anatomy and explain why .
what they practiced was an illegitimate concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years .
and , as you all remember , what our founding fathers was the idea of the monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic notion of the anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world did not know dna , but they had clear the idea of the birthright .
they had the concept of blue blood .
they were from the idea that the political power was hit by the right of blood passed from the grandfather and then the son and so on .
the founding fathers of that idea , and they started by a new concept of <unk> , and that concept was that all men are created the same .
they <unk> the playing field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the anatomy . that was very radical .
and partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were being destroyed .
there was democracy and at the same time <unk> science .
and it &apos;s very clear , if you look at the history of the founding fathers , which many were very interested in science and the idea of a naturalist .
they were getting tired of supernatural explanations and thus <unk> the concept of supernatural power being passed through a vague idea of the right of birth .
they were moving towards a naturalist .
and if you look , for example , the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as a result , they were actually passing the idea of the southern match .
and by doing so , they were <unk> the foundations of the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think that way , but they did it for us and it was cool .
and what happened years later ?
it happened that women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the concept of the founding fathers of the coincidence that the coincidence was more important than the veiled difference and said , &quot; the fact that we have a womb and bar is not a significant enough difference to <unk> the right to the vote , the right to a private citizenship , etc . &quot;
and the congolese women .
then the success of the civil rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> , saying , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we found men in the lines of civil rights movement saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , the color people who resisted <unk> coincidence on the difference of <unk> and , again , <unk> .
we see the same with the <unk> movement .
the problem is , of course , as we look at the coincidence , we have to start asking why we hold certain divided .
but , attention , i want to keep some <unk> in our culture .
for example , i don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don &apos;t mean we should fight the anatomy .
i don &apos;t mean that five @-@ year @-@ olds should be allowed to have sex or get married .
there are some divisions that make sense to me and that i think we should keep .
but the challenge is to try to find out what they are , why keep them and if they make sense .
well , let &apos;s go back to those two beings at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day .
imagine one of them , mary , three months before time : on june 1st of 1980 .
henry , on the opposite , he was born in term : march 1st of 1980 .
by the only fact that he was born three months before mary <unk> all the rights three months before henry -- the right to sexual consent , the right to vote , the right to <unk> .
henry has to wait for that , not because he &apos;s a different biological age , but he was born after .
we found other <unk> in relation to their rights .
henry , as opposed to being considered a man -- i haven &apos;t told you whether he &apos;s squeamish , virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> the <unk> <unk> that mary doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
mary , on his side , does not have the same rights as henry in every state , for example .
henry can get married in every state with a woman , but mary can marry a woman just in some states .
so , they still have brain categories that are in many ways questionable and number of ways .
and now the question is : what do we do now that science does so much in the field of the anatomy that we get at the point that having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could actually drip ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes i feel like science gets away .
where are we going ?
it seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of pragmatic attitude : &quot; well , we have to draw the line elsewhere , so we &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
but a lot of people are trapped in a weird position .
for example , texas at some point has decided that to marry a man , you don &apos;t have to have y chromosome and get married with a woman , you have to have y @-@ chromosome .
now , in practice , they don &apos;t do <unk> tests of people .
but this is also very strange , given the story that i told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome .
if you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , in his &quot; i <unk> &quot; -- he offers a solution .
it says that we should address people based on not the color of their skin , but the content of their character , &quot; going beyond the anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , the idea looks really good . &quot;
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do people judge the content of their character ?
i want to also point out that i &apos;m not sure that we need to be involved in this to supply people &apos;s rights , because i have to admit that i know a few <unk> that probably deserve more of the social services than some humans i know .
i also want to say that maybe some <unk> i know can make more intelligent decisions and smarter decisions about their sex relationships than 40 people i know .
so , how do you actually put the theme of character content ?
it &apos;s very difficult .
and one part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could in the future be measured by an instrument , maybe an mri .
do we really want to get to that point ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going .
what i do know is it seems to be very important that the united states still has this <unk> of thinking about democracy .
we &apos;ve done a good job in defense for democracy , and i think we &apos;re going to do a good job in the future .
we don &apos;t live , for example , in a context like the iranian where a man who is attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed , unless he &apos;s willing to have a sex change , in which case he can live .
we &apos;re not in that situation .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have a context like a surgeon who i spoke with a couple of years ago that he had made birth identical twins and then separate his fame .
but when i asked the question of the operation , it was a very <unk> operation , he replied that in that other country , these kids would be very <unk> and therefore he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , has you considered the political asylum rather than the surgical separation ? &quot;
america offers huge possibilities for people to be who are unable to change by the well of the state .
so i think we have to be on our head .
well , in closing , i mean i &apos;ve been talking a lot about the dads .
and i want to think about what democracy would be like , or as it could have been , if we had gotten more and more participation in the world .
and i want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist , and i think there may be different ideas coming from different backgrounds , especially if there are people thinking about group .
for years , since i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also been interested in finding sexual difference .
and one of the things that i &apos;ve been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operating in the world .
and what we know about cyber studies is that women , on average , not all , but ultimately tend to pay more attention to complex social relations and care about those who are trafficked within the group .
and if we think about that , we have an interesting situation in our hands .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my consultants who knew that i was interested in poet feminism -- i considered myself a feminist -- as a <unk> , he made me a strange argument .
&quot; tell me what the female of feminism has . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; it &apos;s the stupidest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism has to do with getting rid of gender stereotypes , so there &apos;s no female in feminism . &quot;
but the more i &apos;ve thought about his question , the more it has seemed to me that there is something female about feminism .
i mean , there could be something , on average , something different between the female brain and male brain that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable .
so , while the dads were very attentive to finding ways to protect the people from the state , it &apos;s possible that , if we were more supportive to this concept , maybe we would have <unk> the concept of protection with the reciprocal support .
and maybe that &apos;s what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond the anatomy : to think less about the individual body , in terms of identity , and think more about relationships .
so , while we &apos;re trying to create a more perfect union , let &apos;s think about what we do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my <unk> .
but before i show you what &apos;s inside , i &apos;m going to make a public confession , and that is , i &apos;m really obsessed with costumes .
i love finding , dress , and more recently , to photograph and publish in my blog bold , colorful and different costumes for every time .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
all my clothes is by second hand of <unk> markets and hand stores .
ah , thank you .
the second hand stores allow me to lower the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my wallet .
i get to know <unk> people ; usually my money goes to a good cause ; my looks unique ; and buying turns into my personal search for <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
do you like color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all answers are positive , then i feel like i &apos;ve won .
going back to the theme of my <unk> , i want to tell you what i want to say for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what &apos;s next to someone who has all that clothes ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought in .
i &apos;ve brought seven pairs of underwear , and nothing else .
underwear for exactly one week is all i &apos;ve put in my <unk> .
i figured it would be able to find everything else that i would like to use after i got here to palm springs .
and since they don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear , that means i found some things .
and i &apos;d like to show you now the set up for this week .
doesn &apos;t it sound interesting ?
while i do , i &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the lessons of life , believe it or not , i &apos;ve learned in this adventure of not using new gear .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money looking good .
you can almost always see you very much for less than 50 dollars .
the whole thing , including the jacket , cost me 55 , and it &apos;s the most expensive thing i &apos;ve ever used in the week .
monday : color is energy .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be wrong , when you &apos;re wearing a bright red pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to attract other happy people .
tuesday : integration is fixed .
i &apos;ve spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk> .
i just know you .
if you get tired of the right people , you don &apos;t just understand them , you also pray .
wednesday : tell the kid inside .
sometimes people tell me that it sounds like i &apos;m a fish game , or i remind them of their little seven @-@ year @-@ old .
i like to tell you , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : trust is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking good at something , it &apos;s almost certain you are .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking good at something , it &apos;s probably true .
my mother taught me this day after day .
but it wasn &apos;t until the 30 years that i really understood his meaning .
and i &apos;m going to explain it in a few seconds .
if you think you &apos;re a beautiful person inside you and outside , there &apos;s no eyes you can &apos;t attract .
so there &apos;s no excuse to anyone in this audience .
we must be able to achieve everything we want to do .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth <unk> words for you : the gold <unk> go with everything .
and finally , saturday : developing a self @-@ and @-@ only personal way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word .
i &apos;ve tried it over and over again when people were approaching this week , just because of what i was using . and we had fantastic conversations .
obviously all this is not going to go into my little <unk> .
so before i go home , to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to donate everything .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that you have to leave behind certain things .
i don &apos;t need to physically <unk> these things , because in the back of the corner , there will always be another suit , crazy and bright colorful , if there &apos;s a little love in my heart and i &apos;m looking .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon everyone .
i have something to show you .
think it &apos;s a <unk> , a flying <unk> .
in our lab , we call it sensitive design .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about this .
if you look at this picture -- i &apos;m from italian origin , all the children in italy grew up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom , but the reason i show you this is that something very interesting has happened in the careers of one in the last two decades .
now , some time ago , if you wanted to win a career in thrive , you would take a budget and you would give it to a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , you would win the race .
but today , if you want to win a career , you need something like this too -- something that <unk> your car in real time , with thousands of sensors that deliver information and convey it to the system to then manipulate and use it to help the car and change things in real time as information is released .
this is what , in engineering , the control system in real time .
it &apos;s essentially a system that has two components : a sensor and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting today is that real @-@ time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , have been covered with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re turning computers into the open air .
and , like that , they &apos;re starting to respond differently and they can be copied and <unk> .
cities are big .
as a separate story , i wanted to say that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s crust , but they represent 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
75 percent of the energy consumption -- and even 80 percent of the co2 emissions .
if we could do something with cities , it would be big .
beyond cities , all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects .
this is an exhibition of late year at moma during the summer during the summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> to me . &quot;
well , our objects , the environment , begin to speak to us .
in a way , it &apos;s as if almost all of the existing atoms become sensors and actuators .
and that &apos;s completely changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outside environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo .
you know , when michelangelo <unk> the moses , he says he eventually took the hammer , and he threw it down in moses -- you can still see a little bio @-@ <unk> and screaming , &quot; <unk> , actually ? &quot;
well , today , for the first time , our environment starts talking to us .
and i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples , insisting on the idea of engaging the environment and having something .
let &apos;s start with the detection .
the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab .
this was four and a half years ago in italy .
what we did there was we used a new kind of network of that moment that had been developed all over the world -- the <unk> phone network and <unk> information from that network , which was somehow <unk> by the operator to understand the functioning of the city .
it was a summer hopefully 2006 .
it was the year in italy he won the world cup .
maybe some of you remember it , they play italy and france , and at the end of the day -- he gave the <unk> .
and anyway , he eventually won italy .
now let &apos;s look at what happened that day , looking at the tectonic activity in the network .
here we see the city .
you see the coliseum in the middle and the river <unk> .
it &apos;s the morning , before the game .
the time line is at the top .
late afternoon , there are people over here and there doing calls , moving .
the game begins : silence .
<unk> from france . <unk> from italy .
<unk> ; people do a quick call and goes to the bathroom .
second time . end of time wasted .
first extra time , second .
<unk> , and at a moment , we are <unk> .
he wins italy , yes !
that night , everyone is demanding the center .
there you see the big spike .
the next day , everyone was at the center of the winning team and the prime minister then .
and then the whole world went down .
you see the picture of the site called massimo circus , where , of the roman time , people are going to celebrate ; it &apos;s a great party ; you can see the spike at the end of the day .
this is just an example of how today you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we could not have done just a few years ago .
another quick detection example : it &apos;s not about people , it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
today we know everything about the source of our objects .
this is a map that shows all the chips that make a mac , how you assemble .
but we know very little about where things are going .
so in this project , we developed a few little labels to track the trash in its <unk> through the system .
we started with volunteers who helped us in seattle a little over a year ago , to label what they were throwing -- different kinds of things , as you can see , things that were anyway .
then we put a little chip on , a tag , to the trash , and then we started to burn it .
these are the results from them .
from seattle .
after a week .
with this information , we realize that there &apos;s a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same with much less energy .
this is data that didn &apos;t exist before .
they &apos;re happening complicated things , and there &apos;s a lot of unnecessary transportation .
but the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup doesn &apos;t disappear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
that if the plastic bottle we throw in one day is still there .
that if we show that to people , then we can promote some behavior change .
that was the reason for the project .
my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could tell us much more about detection and many great things that we can do with that , but i wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning , which is to push it over the environment .
and the first project is something we did a couple of years ago at <unk> .
it all started with a question of the mayor of the city , who came and told us that spain and south europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces , in architecture .
and the question was : how can technology , new technology , add to that ?
and one of the ideas that we developed at mit , in a workshop , was : imagine you have a <unk> and valves , valves and valves , valves , and shut down .
it &apos;s created like a water curtain , with water pixels .
if the pixels can be written in them , show patterns , images , text .
and as you zoom in , the curtain will open so that we can pass , as you see in the image .
we introduced this to the <unk> mayor .
he liked it so much .
and we set up a committee to design the building at the entrance to the <unk> .
we call it the digital highway .
the whole building is made of water .
there are no doors and no windows , but when you approach it , you can move .
the roof is also covered with water .
and if there &apos;s a little bit of wind , if you want to minimize the <unk> , the roof goes down .
or you can close the building and all architecture disappears , like in this case .
those days will always be someone in the winter , when the roof comes down , someone who was there and said , &quot; let &apos;s get the building . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not that they have ignored it , but when it comes down almost all architecture goes away .
here it is working .
you see people being beaten up by what &apos;s going on inside .
and here i am myself trying not to get wet when we try the sensors that open water .
i think i should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working .
that night was really even more fun .
all the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit .
it was no longer a building that would open to leave you , but a building that was still keeping cuts and holes of water and you had to jump so you didn &apos;t jump .
and for us that was very interesting because as architects , engineers , designers , we always think about the use that people will give our designs .
but then reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of doing things to interact , that people use .
this is a picture of the building with the physical pixels , the water pixels of water , and projections about them .
and this is what led us to thinking about the next project i &apos;m going to show you .
imagine that that pixels could start flying .
imagine if you could have little helicopter in the air and every one had a little <unk> that changes color as if it were a cloud that moves in space .
this is the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one we saw before , moving with others in sync .
we could form this cloud .
a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions .
or normal , but in three dimensions , what changes is light , not the position of the pixels .
you can play it with a different kind .
imagine that the screen appears at different scales and sizes , different kinds of resolution .
and that then all of that could be a wall of pixels in 3d , where you can zoom in and go through , and see from very different angles .
this is the real controlled <unk> , going down to form a v , like before .
when the lights go on , you see this . the same thing we saw before .
imagine each one of them being controlled by a person .
we can have every <unk> with an input coming from people , the movement of people , etc . , etc .
i want to show you something for the first time .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> of the best ballet dancers today , the new york <unk> star and la <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3d and use them as input to womanhood .
here we can see <unk> dancing .
on the left side , you see the pixels , it captures in different <unk> .
it &apos;s both scales in real time as motion capture .
it can wash all the movement .
you can go all the way around .
and once we have the pixels , we can play with them , with color and motion , with gravity and rotation .
we want to use this as an entrance to the <unk> .
i wanted to show you the last project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something for the london olympics .
it &apos;s called &quot; the cloud . &quot;
and the idea is , imagine again , that we could engage people in order to do something and change our viewing environment as a barn @-@ raising , but with a cloud .
imagine we could get everyone to consume a little bit for a <unk> .
and i think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that , in the last two decades , we go from the physical world to the digital world .
we &apos;ve digitized everything , as knowledge , and accessible across the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the obama campaign -- we can move from the digital world , the self @-@ organized power of networks , the physical world .
in our case , we might want to use it to design and make a symbol .
that would mean something built in a city .
but tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today : think of climate change or co2 emissions . how do we move from the digital world to the physical world ?
the idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together , collectively .
the cloud is a cloud , again , made out of the very same way the cloud is a cloud of particles .
and those particles are water , while in our cloud , they are pixels .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but it &apos;s covered with pixels .
you can move inside , have different experiences .
you can see from the bottom , serve to share the main moments of the 2012 olympics and even more , and it can be used as a way of connection to the community .
so , it &apos;s both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can climb up , like a new top of london .
you can get in there .
as if he was a new digital <unk> at night , but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work , i &apos;m trying to express that humans are not separate from nature and everything is interconnected .
i was for the first time to antarctica about 10 years ago , and i saw my first cries .
i was amazed .
my heart pounding , i was <unk> , trying to understand what was ahead of me .
i <unk> them around in the water almost 60 meters , and i couldn &apos;t think it was a snowflake as a <unk> of snow over a year after year .
<unk> are born when you get rid of glaciers or breaking ice barriers .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to refuse to give up and hold on to the end , while others can &apos;t afford it more and more <unk> in a dramatic passion <unk> .
it &apos;s easy to think , when we look at an iceberg , which are isolated and separate , largely as we see ourselves sometimes as humans .
but reality is the opposite .
as an iceberg melts , i &apos;m breathing your ancient atmosphere .
as an iceberg melts , a rich sweet water in minerals feeding lots of forms of life .
i &apos;m just going to shoot these <unk> , as if it comes from the portraits of my ancestors , knowing that at these unique moments there are such a way and will never again exist .
it &apos;s not death when it &apos;s proven ; it &apos;s not an end , but a course of its way down the life cycle .
part of the melting ice that <unk> is very young -- has a couple of thousands of years .
and another part of the ice has over 100,000 years .
the last photos i &apos;d like to show you are from an iceberg that i photographed in <unk> , greenland .
it &apos;s unusual to actually get a rolling iceberg .
here you have .
you can see on the left a little boat .
it &apos;s about five meters .
and i would like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and its <unk> line .
you can see here , it starts rolling , the ship has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
this is an iceberg in greenland , average size .
it stands at about 120 feet or 40 meters .
this video is in real time .
and so <unk> , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
i &apos;ve clearly been <unk> in life with many amazing projects .
but the cool one i worked on was for this guy .
the guy is called <unk> .
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s .
one day she came to her house after running , and she said , &quot; dad , i feel a <unk> on my legs . &quot;
and that was the start of als .
today <unk> has a complete paralysis .
it can only use your eyes .
his work influenced me .
i have a design company and animation company , so obviously , graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world .
so we decided we &apos;re going to be going to ask tony , <unk> , and his cause .
so i went and met with her brother and father and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give them this money .
what are you going to do with him ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i only want to be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and he &apos;s able to communicate with me . &quot;
and i said , &quot; one second , it &apos;s not like i &apos;ve seen stephen <unk> , isn &apos;t it that all people with paralysis can communicate through those devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , unless you &apos;re an important person and have a very good insurance , you can &apos;t actually do it .
these devices are not affordable for people . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate then ? &quot;
anyone see the movie &quot; the <unk> and the butterfly ? &quot;
they communicate that way -- they &apos;re <unk> with their finger .
i said , &quot; that &apos;s wei . how can it be ? &quot;
so i came up with the only wish to give a check and rather than that , i signed a check that i had no idea what i was going to cover .
i get distracted by his brother and his father right there at that very moment , &quot; ok , this is the deal : tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to build a machine , and we &apos;re going to find a way to make art again .
because it &apos;s ridiculous that someone who has so much inside can &apos;t get it . &quot;
so i spoke at a conference a couple months later .
i met these guys called graffiti @-@ <unk> lab , who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then , with a laser pointer , they draw on that and register the negative space .
so they &apos;re going around doing art facilities like this .
all the things that come up , they say , they &apos;re part of a life cycle .
they first start with sex organs , then with the bad words , then with bush attacks and , at the end , people start doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home , and as i was dealing with my wife , i would tell him about this , and we said , &quot; if we know that there is the technology that allows you to use your eyes to control things for why we don &apos;t think a way we could control a laser to do graffiti again , that would be great . &quot;
and so the journey began .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of help things from side to side , we had achieved a couple of things .
one , we touch the doors of insurance companies and a machine so that we could communicate , a machine like stephen hawking &apos;s door .
which was great .
and seriously , it &apos;s all fun , and i call him <unk> , because when you talk to the guy , you get an e @-@ mail from him , and you say , &quot; i don &apos;t deserve it . this guy is fantastic . &quot;
the other thing we did was we brought seven programmers from all over the world , <unk> all the different <unk> from the <unk> to our house .
my wife , kids and i , we moved to the garage in the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house .
many of our friends thought we would do something completely stupid , and when we <unk> would have taken away the pictures of the walls and instead there would be graffiti .
but for two weeks , we went to the <unk> ride , my son was part , my dog also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
they &apos;re a pair of cheap sunglasses that we buy at the <unk> beach <unk> beach , some copper wire and home electrical stuff and radio shack .
we take a <unk> camera , we cut it , we put it on an led light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- and you build it yourself ; we publish the code by sending the software down for free .
and we create a device that has absolutely no limitation at all .
there &apos;s no insurance company saying &quot; no . &quot;
there &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; no . &quot;
anyone who has been paralyzed today has access to drawing and communicating with only her eyes .
thank you .
thank you very much . that was awesome .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the <unk> room .
i love this picture because this is the other person &apos;s room , and that &apos;s his room .
there was all this great <unk> and <unk> during the big opening .
and after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , intense sessions of all night , tony was first drawing for seven years .
and this is a wonderful picture , because this is the life support system , and it &apos;s looking through the life support system .
we stimulated her bed so she could see .
and we put a projector on a wall of the park outside the hospital .
and he went again to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking .
the funny thing was , we had to dive in the parking lot , so we feel like we were eating graffiti too .
at the end of this he gave us an e @-@ mail and this was what he said to us , &quot; this was the first time he was drawing in seven years .
i felt like i would have been under the water and someone finally come up and drag me out of there so i could breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
in a way , that &apos;s our war shout .
that &apos;s what keeps us moving , developing .
and we have a long way to go through this .
it &apos;s a cool device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of a climbing screen .
someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to improve and make it faster and robust .
since then , we &apos;ve had all sorts of recognition .
we &apos;ve won a lot of awards .
remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are doing money with this .
everything comes out of our own pockets .
the prizes were the guy , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
armstrong supported something about us , and then , in december , time magazine acknowledged us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , and it was really great .
the best of all of this -- and this is what ends closing -- is that in april this year in the <unk> of <unk> in downtown los angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; art in the streets . &quot;
and &quot; art in the streets &quot; is going to have the best urban <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re all going to be there .
<unk> is going to be in the show that &apos;s pretty cool .
so , this is basically my idea : if you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
none of what &apos;s in this room was possible -- the stage , the computer , the microphone , the microphone -- nothing was possible at some point .
make it possible -- anything in this room .
i &apos;m not a programmer , i never did anything with eye recognition technology ; i just recognized something and give me wonderful people in order to make it happen .
and these are the questions that i want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like we have to do . if it &apos;s not now , when and if i &apos;m not , who ?
thank you guys .
you know what i do is i write for kids , and in fact , i &apos;m probably the author for children , more read in america .
and i always tell people i don &apos;t want to look like a scientist .
i can claim it as a farmer , or with leather clothes , and no one has ever chosen a farmer .
i &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and <unk> .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something that you fell somewhere .
you only have to turn the apple around to see it as an epiphany .
that &apos;s the painting of a circle .
a friend of mine did that -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of tricky circle i &apos;m going to talk to you .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s in middle school , in <unk> , ohio where i was the freak of the class .
as i grew up to bleed every week in the boys &apos; toilets , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me go into the <unk> of the teachers &apos; room .
he made it secret .
for three years .
and i had to go from the city .
i had a thumb , and 85 dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california -- i found a lover -- and in the &apos; 80s , i felt the need to start work in organizations that were fighting aids .
about three or four years ago , in the middle of the night i got a phone call from that teacher , the <unk> lady who said , &quot; i need to see you .
i &apos;m adults that we never get to know .
you could fly to ohio , and please bring that man that i know you &apos;ve already found .
and i have to tell you that i have pancreatic cancer , and i would like you to engage with this for please . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we went to see her , we laughed , we cry , and we realized that she needed to be <unk> .
we found a place , we extended it , and we looked at it and we commissioned her family , because it was necessary .
it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
and as the woman who wanted to name her as an adult came to <unk> , she became a rescue box and was thrown in my hands .
and what happened was that the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that i talked to you about did in itself .
epiphany is that death is part of life .
she saved my life , my partner and i save her from her .
and you know that part of life needs everything the rest of life .
it needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m very happy that we talked a lot about this today .
it also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our work to provide those things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion when you &apos;re at 900 feet tall .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor doing carved , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
it sounds scary .
well , i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in the <unk> .
it was the only one that could talk to the flight assistants .
so i immediately looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem . you probably see some birds . &quot;
the pilot had already cracked the plane , and we weren &apos;t so far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot <unk> the plane with the hudson river .
usually that &apos;s not the road .
let &apos;s pull the motors out .
imagine being on an airplane and without noise .
and then he said three words -- the three most <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he said , &quot; prepare for the impact . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more about the flying assistant .
i could see him in his eyes , it was terror . life is over .
i want to share with you three things that i learned about myself that day .
i learned that everything changes in a moment .
we have this list of things to do before we die , these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to get and didn &apos;t , all the fences that i wanted to fix , all the experiences that i &apos;ve wanted to have and never had .
as i was thinking about that later , i was a phrase , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i &apos;m going to open it up .
i don &apos;t want to have anything in life .
and that urgency , that purpose , really changed my life .
the second thing i learned that day -- and this is when i hit the bridge george washington , which was not very much -- i thought about , wow , i really feel a big deal .
i &apos;ve lived a good life .
in my humanity and my mistakes , i have tried to improve everything i did .
but in my humanity , i also gave my ego .
and i &apos;m sorry about the time i &apos;m focusing on things that i don &apos;t mean by people who matter .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
and then , as i looked at that , i was trying to remove the negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
in two years , i haven &apos;t had a fight with my wife .
it feels like wonders .
i &apos;m no longer trying to be right ; i choose to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and this is like your mental clock is ticking , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
you see the water coming .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; please fly . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this to break into 20 pieces like you see in those documentaries .
and as i breathed , i had the feeling of , wow , dying is not fearful .
it &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been working for it all our life .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and that sadness is in a single thought , which is , i just wish one thing .
i wish i could see my kids grow .
a month later , i was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade , not so much artistic talent ...
... still .
and i scream , <unk> , like a little girl .
and for me , that was the whole reason of being in the world .
at that point , i understood by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great parent .
above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good parent .
i was given a miracle , not dying that day .
and i was given another gift , which was the potential to look at the future and come back and live differently .
you &apos;re flying today , the challenge to imagine that the same thing is happening on your plane -- and please not be -- but imagine , how would it change ?
what would you do , which you still expect to do , because you think you &apos;re going to live forever ?
how would it change their relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and most important , are they being the best parents they can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the computer worm is actually very simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to get the nuclear bomb .
its biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the gasoline plant in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see are real @-@ time control systems .
if we can engage these systems that control speeds and tubes , we can have a lot of problems with <unk> .
gray boxes don &apos;t use windows software ; they &apos;re from a completely different technology .
but if we can put a worldwide @-@ effective windows virus on a computer that was used by an engineer to set up this gray box , then we &apos;re ready .
this is the behind <unk> .
we started with a russian <unk> .
the <unk> enters the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge , and the iranian program is <unk> ; it &apos;s <unk> mission .
it &apos;s easy , huh ?
i want to tell you how we discover this .
when we started doing research on <unk> six months ago , the purpose was completely unknown .
the only thing that was known is that it &apos;s very , very complex in the part of windows : <unk> used multiple e @-@ zero @-@ sum vulnerabilities .
it seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes , these control systems .
that called our attention , and we started an experiment where we <unk> our surroundings with <unk> and saw what was going on with this .
so they spent very strange things .
<unk> would appear as a laboratory rat that he didn &apos;t like our cheese : he &apos;d smell it , but he didn &apos;t want to eat .
it didn &apos;t make sense for me .
and after experiencing different cheese kicks , i realized , and i thought , &quot; this is an attack .
it &apos;s completely run . &quot;
the <unk> is seeking actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration , and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working in that place .
if not , <unk> does nothing .
so that called my attention , and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day , because i thought , &quot; we don &apos;t know what the goal is . &quot;
it could be , for example , an american energy plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
better than the goal soon .
so we pulled out and pulled the attack code , and we found that it was structured at two digital bombs : a small one and a big one .
we also saw that they were armed very professionally by people who obviously had all the information inside .
they knew all the points for attacking .
you probably even know how much the operator is .
so , you know everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that <unk> is complex and high tech , let me tell you , the payload is very complex .
it &apos;s very much above all we &apos;ve seen before .
here you see a sample of this attack code .
we &apos;re talking about around 15,000 lines of code .
it looks pretty much like the old <unk> language .
i want to tell you how we could find sense of this code .
what we were looking at at at the beginning was called the functions of the system , because we know what they &apos;re doing .
then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and trying to link them to the real world , with potential targets in the real world .
we need theories about what we can pass or <unk> .
to get to theories about goals , we remember that it &apos;s definitely a violent <unk> , it has to be a valuable white , and it &apos;s probably located in iran , because it &apos;s where most of the infections has been <unk> .
there are not many thousands of goals in that area .
it basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and to the <unk> plant .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i wrote a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our clients . &quot;
i called them up and i told them in an effort to prove their experience with what we find in code and data .
and it worked pretty well .
so we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of rotor .
rotor is that cellular part inside the centrifuge , that black object you see .
if you &apos;re driving the speed of this rotating , you can actually manufacture and even make it <unk> .
what we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go crazy to the nest maintenance engineers , so they couldn &apos;t resolve this very quickly .
we try to crack the digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures .
so , for instance , the number <unk> out in that code , you can &apos;t get away .
i started doing science literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> , and i found that they &apos;re <unk> in what &apos;s called a waterfall , and every waterfall is <unk> .
that made sense , there was a coincidence .
and he got better yet .
these <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages .
and guess what we found in the attack code ?
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a good coincidence .
this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between our hands .
so he didn &apos;t have any <unk> , he didn &apos;t .
the results have been collected after several weeks of hard work .
normally , we had to crawl out and have to start again .
yet , we discovered that both digital <unk> will target one and the same goal , but from different angles .
the little <unk> is drinking down , and turning these rotors and spins them and <unk> , and the big <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating valves .
in sum , we &apos;re very confident that we have determined what the recipient is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
we don &apos;t have to worry about other goals being driven by stopping .
here i show you some very interesting things that we saw , i really got scared .
there &apos;s the gray box , and the top you see the <unk> .
so what this thing does is he <unk> the input values from the sensors , for example , of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provides legitimate code , which is still running during the attack , with false input data .
and believe it or not , these false input data is <unk> by <unk> .
it &apos;s like in the hollywood movies where , during the theft , the safety camera is actually <unk> .
it &apos;s cool , huh ?
the idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the room of control .
it &apos;s actually much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to enable a digital security system .
we need digital security systems where a human operator couldn &apos;t act fast .
for example , in a power plant , when the big steam turbine comes up , you have to open up the escape tubes in a millisecond .
obviously , this cannot do a human operator .
that &apos;s where we need digital security systems .
and when they &apos;re engaged , then they can do bad things .
the plant can burst .
and you don &apos;t even notice the security system .
that scares it .
but it can be worse .
what i &apos;m going to say is very important .
think about this . this attack is generic .
it has nothing to do with , specifically , with <unk> , with uranium <unk> .
it could also work , for example , in a power plant , or in a car factory .
it &apos;s generic .
and you don &apos;t have to disseminate this burden with a usb key , as we saw in the case of <unk> .
you could also use conventional worms technology to <unk> them .
it <unk> as possible .
and if you do that , what you find is with a <unk> of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence that we have to deal with .
unfortunately , the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the middle east .
it &apos;s in the united states and japan .
all the green areas are large spaces with large numbers of goals .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start preparing us now .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s taken public on many sides that people assume that <unk> is the primary entity behind this .
what &apos;s your opinion ?
ralph <unk> : okay , do you really want to hear this ?
okay . okay .
my view is that the <unk> is involved , but the engine is not israel .
the engine behind this is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s one alone , and that &apos;s the united states , fortunately , .
because , otherwise , our problems would be even bigger .
thank you for inviting us . thank you , ralph .
i &apos;ve spent the last few years researching into situations generally very difficult and at the same time a little dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i shot in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days eating only this -- fun at first , which is difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , most of my career , i &apos;ve been <unk> in situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of looking at social issues in ways that encourage attractive , interesting things , and hopefully analyzing them in a way that will be both seen and accessible to the audience .
so when i knew i would come here to do a tedtalk on the world of brands and patronage , i wanted to do something a little different .
so , some of you may have heard , or not , a couple of weeks ago , i took an announcement on ebay .
i sent some messages on facebook , some on twitter , i offered the rights of my tedtalk name in 2011 .
so , some fortunate , a corporation , a nonprofit , was going to have the unique opportunity in the grateful life that chris anderson is not going to allow him to buy the rights of the talk that you &apos;re looking at right now that he didn &apos;t have a lot of content , and it didn &apos;t actually explain what the topic would be .
what was the following thing : &quot; here <unk> name shows : my tedtalk that you have no idea what it &apos;s all about and content could be buried in the face , especially if i put it ridiculous to you or your company to do it .
but to say that , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity . &quot;
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
it &apos;s a title of progress , by the way .
so even with that <unk> , i knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name .
if you had asked me a year ago , i could not have been asked for sure .
but in the new film that i &apos;m working on , we look at the world of marketing , about advertising .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;ve been in horrible situations in the last few years , but nothing could make me ready , nothing could work for me as hard or as dangerous as i could walk into the halls with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
i want to make a film that tries to make the product <unk> and marketing and advertising , and the whole film is all about products and marketing and advertising .
the movie is going to call &quot; the bigger film ever known . &quot;
what happens in &quot; the biggest film ever &quot; is that everything from the top down , in principle , has <unk> images , all the time , from the <unk> that appears before the title , the x @-@ ray .
now , this brand , <unk> , the center .
these people are clinging to the film -- forever .
and so the film explores all this idea . is it what ? a <unk> , forever ?
i &apos;m a storyteller .
it was more emphasis .
it was &quot; a <unk> . forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the x @-@ marks on the title , but we &apos;re going to make sure we have all the categories that we can in the film .
maybe you &apos;ll get a shoe , and you get the most cool shoe you &apos;ve used ...
the most cool car you &apos;ve ever led in &quot; the biggest film you &apos;ve ever seen , &quot; the best drink you &apos;ve ever had , ever ruined by &quot; the <unk> film . &quot;
the idea is then apart from showing the marks as part of the life , making them clarify the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole process in this movie .
that &apos;s the whole idea , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would love you to help make it happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny because it &apos;s the first time i hear that ; it &apos;s the maximum respect for the audience .
however , i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t know if the &quot; angle &quot; is too stubborn , but you know how it &apos;s going to crash ?
how much money does it take to do this ?
a million and a half .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard the meeting with them , but it &apos;s definitely going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands .
who knows , maybe for the moment the movie comes out , let &apos;s see us as a whole bunch of prescription idiots .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
most of the answers are &quot; no . &quot;
but will it be hard to sell , by the film or for me ?
jk : both things .
it means you &apos;re not very optimistic .
so , do you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
all right .
amazing .
we have to think about which brands .
yes .
when you look at the people you have to treat ...
we have some places to go .
turn the camera off .
i thought , &quot; <unk> the camera &quot; meant we have a conversation outside of a mic .
turns out the camera means , &quot; we don &apos;t want to know anything about your movie . &quot;
and so it was , one by one , all these companies suddenly disappeared .
none wanted to have anything to do with this movie .
i was shocked .
they didn &apos;t want to know anything about this project .
and i was very impressed , i thought the concept of advertising , was to present the product to as many people as possible , to tell them that so many people watched it as possible .
especially in today &apos;s world , this intersection of new media and old media and the media landscape , is it not the idea of having that new vehicle worthy of attention that &apos;s going to lead the message to the masses ?
no , that &apos;s what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had a <unk> error , and that error was this .
actually , no , there was no such mistake .
there was no mistake at all .
this would have been fine .
but the problem was what this image represents .
see , when you look for images of transparency in google , it appears -- this is one of the first images that appear .
i like your way to roll , sergey brin . no .
this was the problem : transparency -- open @-@ source or deception -- easily detected or seen -- which is characterized by the visibility or <unk> of information , especially in business practices -- being the last line maybe the biggest problem .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency in these days .
our politicians name him , the ceo , the <unk> , even the ceos name him .
but all of a sudden when it comes to doing it , something really changes .
but why ? well , transparency is afraid -- like that weird bear that still remains .
it &apos;s unpredictable -- like this weird road .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is it risky ?
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s very risky .
when i started talking with companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; no , we want you to save a story . &quot;
we want you to examine a story , but to celebrate our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father would lie to me at lie -- and there he is looking at me , looking at me , saying , &quot; son , there are three sides in every story .
there &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story , and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
as you see , in this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
but with only one company , an agency wants to help me -- and that only because i knew john bond and richard <unk> of many years -- i realized that i would have to go on my own , i would have to get out of the middle @-@ man and go to the companies myself with my whole team .
so what i began to realize suddenly -- and what i started giving <unk> is that when you start talking to corporations , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends who make large films , huge , giant films and other people who make small films , independent films like mine .
and my friends who make large hollywood movies , giant hollywood tell them that the reason their movies are so successful is because of the associated brands that they have .
and then my friends who do independent movies say , &quot; well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant hollywood movies ? &quot;
and the movie is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> film . &quot;
how are we going to see specifically to ban it in the movie ?
every time i &apos;m about to go out , every time i open my <unk> , you &apos;ll see the <unk> ban .
at any time during an interview with someone i can say , &quot; are you okay for this interview ?
are you ready ? you get a little nervous .
i want to help you out .
maybe you should get a little bit of this before the interview . &quot;
and there we <unk> a bunch of these fabulous <unk> .
both the floral fusion as &quot; <unk> of paradise &quot; is going to have its opportunity .
we &apos;re going to have as much for men as a woman , solid , <unk> , onstage , whatever .
that &apos;s the general look .
now i can answer your questions and give you a glimpse .
we &apos;re a small brand .
similar to the type of smaller films that we hate ; we &apos;re more good a competing brand .
so we don &apos;t have the budget that has other brands .
so doing things like that , you know , reminding people is the reason that this is interesting to us .
what words would they use to describe to ban ?
ban is blank .
that &apos;s a big question .
higher technology .
technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the browser .
we talk about something audacious , fresh .
i think &quot; cool &quot; is a big word that actually puts this category in positive versus &quot; the smell and sweat . &quot;
it keeps you cool .
how do we keep you warm ? with more and more freshness , three times cooler .
things like those who broke the benefits .
and that &apos;s a <unk> company .
what about me ? what about a common guy ?
i need to talk to the man on the street , to the people like me , to the common <unk> .
they have to talk to me about my brand .
how do you define your brand ?
mm : my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i like good clothes .
woman : she reaches &apos; 80s , &apos; <unk> &apos; unless she &apos;s too late .
okay , so what &apos;s the <unk> brand ?
something unique .
i guess the kind of gender , the style i have would be like a dark glamour .
i like dark colors , lots of gray and things like that .
i usually wear accessories like sunglasses , or i like crystals and similar .
if dan was a brand , he could be a classic <unk> , mercedes benz .
the brand i am , i would call it casual flight .
a woman # 2 : in a hippie part , in part of &apos; girl brooklyn , i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the type of pets .
i sell pet toys in the country and in the world .
so i guess that &apos;s my brand .
in my little sector , that &apos;s my brand .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because he <unk> <unk> .
man 5 : <unk> @-@ <unk> .
is that something ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a lawyer .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be marking tom , but i often get into the intersection of dark glamour and casual flight .
i realized i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could come into my head , someone who could help me understand what they call the &quot; brand personality . &quot;
and i found a company called pittsburgh <unk> .
they helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , helping discover that brand personality .
if they could do it for them , they could surely do it for me .
i &apos;m going to read the photos , right ?
yes . the first photo is a family photo .
tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to being .
these people shape my way of looking at the world .
tell me about that world .
that world ? i think your world is the world you live in -- like the people around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the work you do .
all of those things come out and start in a place and in my case they come and start in my family , in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
the next is &quot; this is the best day of my life . &quot;
how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings and your way to be ?
it &apos;s like who wants to be me .
i like different things .
i like strange things . i like weird things .
tell me why ... &quot; why ? what does that serve us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what phase of the <unk> do you find now ?
why is it important to start ? what &apos;s red ?
tell me a little bit about that .
a little more of you , not who you are .
what other guesses ?
you don &apos;t have to fear . what kind of rollercoaster do you ?
ow ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yes . all right .
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come out of this .
there was a lot of madness .
the first thing i saw was this idea that there are two different sides , but margins , in your brand personality , morgan <unk> , is a very conscious / players .
they were perfectly fine together .
and i think there &apos;s almost a paradox in them .
and i think some corporations only focus on one of their strong points or another rather than focusing on both .
many companies tend to -- and it &apos;s the nature -- to avoid the things that are not safe ; they prevent fear , those elements , and you actually give them to sink and make them become positive for you , and it &apos;s nice to see that .
what other brands are like this ?
the first here is the classic , apple .
and you can also see here at <unk> , wii , mini of <unk> and <unk> .
now there are cognitive marks and <unk> brands , those things that have gone and come , but a playful conscious brand is a fairly powerful thing .
a playful conscious brand . what is your brand ?
if someone asks you to understand your brand identity , your brand personality , what would it be ?
are you an up ? are you somebody who makes blood flow ?
or are you a better asset ?
a little quieter , special , conservative ?
the ascending attributes are like being playful and being like the prince , contemporary , <unk> , fearless , fearless or bold as <unk> , rapid , or <unk> , dominant , magic or mystic as <unk> .
or are you better off @-@ the @-@ down ?
are you mindful , sophisticated ?
are you established , traditional provider , protector ? you &apos;ll be punished with oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , familiar , confident , sacred , <unk> or wise , like the dalai lama or <unk> ?
in the course of this movie , we had over 500 companies and climbing and <unk> , saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want to be part of this project .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film , mainly because they wouldn &apos;t have control , they wouldn &apos;t have control over the end product .
but we got 17 marketing partners who were willing to give up that control that they wanted to be in the business with someone who &apos;s conscious and playful like me and who , ultimately , we were empowered to tell stories that we would usually not have been able to tell stories after a post would usually go .
we were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> , and we were able to tell the story in this movie of how they are now using mri so that we could identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing and film .
we went to são paulo where advertising has banned air .
throughout the city for the last five years there are no fences , there &apos;s no posters , there &apos;s no <unk> , there &apos;s nothing .
and we went to school districts where businesses are on their way into schools with u.s. money supply problems .
the amazing thing to me is that the projects that i &apos;ve had the biggest answer or the most successful response is the ones that i &apos;ve been working on with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these marks did .
they took the <unk> , they took their agencies , and they said maybe these agencies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to try directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to make people think , that &apos;s going to defy the way we look at the world .
and how have you been ? do you succeed ?
well , ever since the movie was released in the <unk> festival , let &apos;s take a look .
as the movie came out in january , and since then -- and this is not <unk> -- we &apos;ve had 900 million impressions in the media for this film .
this just takes a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half week period .
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no tv .
the movie is still <unk> .
it &apos;s still not online . it &apos;s not in <unk> .
it hasn &apos;t even presented in other countries yet .
ultimately , this film has already begun to gain momentum .
and it &apos;s not bad because almost all the agencies we talk to their clients aren &apos;t being part .
i &apos;ve always believed that if you risk them , if you take risks , that in those risks there are opportunities .
i think when you get people out of that , you &apos;re pushing them into failure .
i think when you train your employees at risk aversion , you &apos;re preparing all your company to reward them .
i feel that what has to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to risk .
we have to encourage people who are not afraid of opportunities that can be missed .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to bring fear to place .
we have to put that bear in a cage .
we numb fear . we risk .
from a <unk> at a time , we have to embrace risk .
and ultimately , we have to get transparency .
more than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way .
and by saying this , with honesty and transparency , all my talk &quot; <unk> the <unk> &quot; has been brought by my good friends of mine who for dollars was buying the rights of the name on ebay .
turning big data into big opportunities for companies around the world .
<unk> shows the <unk> .
thank you very much .
so , morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened with those dollars growing ?
it &apos;s a fantastic question .
in my pocket , i have a check to name for the ted matrix , which is the molecular foundation , which is a check for dollars to be applied to my assistance for ted next year .
my name is <unk> .
and 18 months ago , i was doing another job on google , until i launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss , who &apos;s here and allowed me to do it .
it took me 18 months and 18 months .
many negotiations and stories , i assure you , with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did it .
i think my own story just explains this slide , and this is access .
i grew up in india .
joy of a great education -- i didn &apos;t have access to many of these museums and works of art .
so when i started traveling and going to museums , i started learning a lot .
and working on google , i try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing it .
better than i show the demo , and then i &apos;ll tell you a couple of interesting things that we &apos;ve done since we launch it .
so , just : we &apos;re going to bake sale .
look around all the museums there .
there &apos;s the <unk> gallery , moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i &apos;m actually going to go into one of my favorites , to <unk> , the new york art museum .
there are two ways of doing that -- very simple .
we click , we click ! we &apos;re already in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are , mumbai or <unk> , that doesn &apos;t really matter .
you move around and you have fun .
do you want to browse to the museum ?
we open the upper plane , and with one click , we jump inside .
they &apos;re inside , you want to go to the end of the hall .
keep going . what &apos;s going away .
exploring .
thank you , but i haven &apos;t reached the best .
now i &apos;m standing in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; by pieter <unk> at the <unk> .
i see the command + .
if the museum shows us the picture , we click there .
look , this is one of the images .
here &apos;s all the data from metadata .
for those of you who are really interested in art , you can click there , but i &apos;m going to click right here .
and this is one of the images that we &apos;ve captured in what we call <unk> technology .
so this image , for example , contains , i think , about 10,000 million pixels .
and there are many people who ask me , &quot; and what do you get with 10,000 million hits ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you what you actually get with 10,000 million pixels .
it can zoom in around in very simple ways .
you see fun things that are happening .
i love this guy , his expression has no price .
but if i really dive into it .
so i started playing , and i found something that was happening there .
and i said , &quot; wait a moment , this looks interesting . &quot;
i went in and discovered that kids were actually playing something .
i investigate a little bit , i talked to some people from the <unk> , and i actually discovered that this is a game called &#91; unclear &#93; , which is about hitting a stick with a pole on the <unk> .
and apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they were doing it , but i &apos;ve learned something about it .
and now we &apos;re going to get even further down and you &apos;ll see that you can actually get to the cracks .
now just to give you a little bit of perspective , i &apos;m going to take the picture away , so you &apos;ll really see what &apos;s there .
this is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is coming , second .
so now we &apos;re going fast to jump again to moma in new york .
here &apos;s another one of my favorites , &quot; the night <unk> . &quot;
the example i showed was to find details .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
it increases and actually what it does .
i &apos;m going to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and i &apos;m really going to reach the cracks .
this is &quot; <unk> night , &quot; i think i &apos;d never seen it before .
i &apos;m going to show you another one of my favorite features .
there are many things more here , but i don &apos;t have time to go .
this is the really cool part . it &apos;s called collections .
all of you , absolutely everyone , doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich or poor , or if you have a mansion , that does the same thing .
you can online create your own museum , create your own collection from all these pictures .
it &apos;s very simple ; we come in -- i &apos;ve created this function that i call the power of zooming , &quot; -- we &apos;ve just made a zooming in .
this is &quot; the ambassadors &quot; at the national gallery in london .
you can write things down , send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you consider these masterpieces .
so in conclusion , i think for me , the main thing is that all amazing things don &apos;t really come from google .
no , in my opinion , they don &apos;t even come from the museums .
maybe i shouldn &apos;t say this .
they actually come from those artists .
and that has been my humble experience with this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium to make justice to its artwork and to be properly represented .
and the big question they ask me today is , &quot; have you made this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
and the answer is no .
it is for supplement the experience .
and that &apos;s it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts .
the left side , which is the logical part , and the right side , which is the intuitive part .
so if we could scale it up to measure the fitness of every hemisphere , we could design a plan of our brain .
for example , this would be someone who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be someone who &apos;s totally intuitive .
so where does your brain scale ?
some of these extreme <unk> , but i think for most of the members of this audience , his brain is something like this -- with a great fitness in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not that they are mutually exclusive .
you can be intuitive , intuitive .
i think of one of those people , like most other experimental quantum physicists , we need quite a lot of logic to explain these complicated ideas .
but at the same time , we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we like to play with things .
we start to play with them , and then we see them react , and then we develop our intuition from that point .
and actually , you do the same thing .
some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing says that one thing can only be in a place at a time .
i mean , it may sound odd to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , they developed it .
i remember looking at a child playing a parking bar .
he was a little kid , and he didn &apos;t do it very well , he always fell .
but i bet the game with that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson , and that is that big things don &apos;t allow the <unk> to stay in a place .
this is a big conceptual model that you can have from the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
it would be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with parking bars , they play with these strange particles .
and when they play with their particles , they discover that they do all sorts of really strange things -- like they can go across walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called it quantum mechanics theory .
at that point , physics was found some years ago ; we had quantum mechanics to describe these little particles .
but we didn &apos;t need it to describe the big objects around us every day .
that &apos;s not really good for my intuition , and maybe that &apos;s because i don &apos;t play very often with particles .
well , sometimes i play with them , but not very much .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody saw a particle .
but it also wouldn &apos;t be fine with my logic .
because if it &apos;s all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t it all follow the principles of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t find the reason it shouldn &apos;t .
and so i would feel much better if i could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics .
that &apos;s why a few years ago , i set out to do exactly that .
and i did .
this is the first object you can see that it &apos;s been in a quantum mechanical overlap .
what we see here is a little computer chip .
and you can try and see the green dot right in the middle .
that &apos;s the little bit of metal i &apos;m going to talk about in a minute .
this is a picture of the object .
and here i &apos;m going to zoom in a little bit . it &apos;s right in the middle .
and then here we do a big approach to the little metal <unk> .
what we see is a little bit of metal , with a trampoline , and then sticking out onto a platform .
and so i did this almost the same way you would make a computer chip .
i went to a clean room with a silicon chip , and i started running all the big machines for about 100 hours .
for the last material , i had to build my own machine -- to make this hole @-@ in @-@ the @-@ mode of swimming underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap , but it needs a little help .
let me make an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people .
i mean , when i &apos;m in an elevator only , i do all sorts of weird things , but then when other people come up , i stop doing those things , because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or actually , freak .
quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way .
the travel mates of inanimate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light that pushes it and the wind that goes up and the heat of the room .
so we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics , we would have to <unk> all the other passengers .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we <unk> the lights , then we introduced a hoover and we pulled all the air out , and then we cool it down to a temperature of less a degree above zero .
now , when you &apos;re only in the elevator , the little bit of metal is free to act as you want .
so we measure their movements .
we found it moving in very strange ways .
instead of just staying still , i was vibrating , and the way i wrote it was like a breath like this -- like a <unk> that stretches out and contract .
and by giving it a smooth push , we could make it float , and not heal at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is really fantastic .
what does it mean that a matter of self and does not affect the same time ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
in one case : all the billions of atoms that make up that piece of metal are still under and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
it &apos;s only in certain directions when those are dancing .
in the rest of the time , they are balanced .
it means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places .
i think this is great .
really .
it was worth investigating in a clean room to do this for all those years , because , look at this , the difference on the scale between one atom and that little metal is roughly the same as the difference between that little metal and you .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , and that piece of metal can be in two different places , why don &apos;t you too ?
i mean , it &apos;s my logical part that he talks .
so imagine if you were in various places at the same time , how would that be ?
how would you affect your consciousness if your body was embedded in space ?
there &apos;s another part of the story .
and that &apos;s when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and we looked inside the box , and we saw that the metal was still in one piece .
and i could get to this new intuition , apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just pointing out in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected .
well , that &apos;s not so true .
it &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the deep <unk> of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work , they have the possibility of choice between a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents .
well , at this point we &apos;re way away from that goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have one city willing to describe them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are much more than their cost of building .
so we could easily <unk> the world tens , maybe hundreds of new cities .
well , this may sound crazy if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but it just <unk> through apartment buildings .
imagine half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owned , and yet half of them still had a chance to do it .
they could try and increase the ability to make the capabilities available in all the buildings .
but you know that the problem that you solve is that buildings and areas around you have rules to avoid discomfort and development distractions .
so it would be very hard to do all those <unk> .
but you could go to a whole new place , build a whole new apartment building , always and when the rules of that place would actually increase the construction rather than putting it in .
so i proposed that governments will bring new areas of big enough reform to hold cities and give them a name : cities under charter .
later , i learned that more or less at the same time , <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of honduras reform .
they knew that every year around 75,000 <unk> would come from their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in honduras .
and at a given moment , <unk> said to <unk> , &quot; what would happen if we took <unk> land , and we just gave them a <unk> , a little bit to the u.s. embassy , and then , if people want to go to work under the rules of canada or the united states , it can go find their work in the united states , do it without the work in the united states . &quot;
in the summer of 2009 , he went through a constitutional crisis .
in the next regular election , synthetic genomics trade @-@ off with a platform in which we collect reforms and at the same time in reconciliation .
he asked <unk> to be his chief of cabinet .
meanwhile , i was preparing to give a talk at tedglobal .
through a process of <unk> , trial and error and a large number of tests with users , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities beneath their most fundamental ideas .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t go and upset all the skyline of apartments .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes so much of technologies as rules to progress , and usually it &apos;s the rules that keep us from moving .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent him to a link with the tedtalk .
he showed him at <unk> .
they called me .
they said , &quot; we will love this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
so in december , we met in miami , in a conference room at a hotel .
i tried to tell you this point about how valuable cities are , much more valuable than their monetary cost .
and i used this picture that shows the value of the land on a place like new york , notice the land that , in some cases , is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , and at some point , when there was a pause , he said , &quot; paul , maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk . &quot;
and the talk described in very simple terms that a city under a charter is a place where you start with <unk> soil , a charter that specifies the rules that are <unk> there and a choice so that people can choose whether or not they want to live under those rules .
so the president of honduras called me , and he said we had to do this project , this is important , this could be the way for our country to advance .
he asked me to go out and talk again the four and five of january .
so i presented another talk full of data , which included an image like this , which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city , this has to be very big .
this is a picture of denver and the white line is the new airport that was built in denver .
just this airport covers over 100 square kilometers .
so i was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city , you have to start with a site that would at least one thousand square kilometers .
that &apos;s over 100,000 acres .
everyone <unk> writes a lot .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attentive .
the leader of congress came to the platform and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you so much for his talk , but maybe we could see the video of the tedtalk .
i have it here on my computer . &quot;
so i sat down and they showed the tedtalk .
and this explained how essential it is that a new city can offer new choices for people .
there would be an option in a city that you might be in honduras , rather than hundreds of miles away to the north .
and we also have new choices for leaders .
because the government of honduras government would need help from partners , could benefit from the countries associated that would force them to establish and fulfill the rules of the charter , so that everybody could trust the charter actually can be able to deal with it .
and what president wolf thought was that that an <unk> that i was considering as a way of engaging the foreign investors so that they would <unk> the city could be just as important to all the parties in honduras for so many years for fear and mistrust .
we went and saw a website .
this photo is from there .
it could easily be about a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly afterwards , on the 19th of january , they voted in congress to reform their constitution , and add a constitutional to enable these special development regions .
in a country that had just passed through this painful crisis , the voting in congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was of <unk> one .
all parties , all the factions in society , the <unk> .
to get you in the constitution , you have to pass twice in congress .
february 17th was approved again in another vote , of <unk> to one .
immediately after the vote , of the 21st to the 24 of february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities .
one of them is south korea .
this is a picture of a new city center that is being built in south korea ; it &apos;s bigger than the center of boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after four years passed the <unk> .
the other interested country in city building is singapore .
in fact , two cities have already built in china and are preparing for a third .
and if you think about this in a practical way , this is the point where we are .
they have a site , and they &apos;re already thinking about a site for the second city .
they &apos;re making a legal system that would allow the administrators to come , and at the same time it would enable them to operate under an external legal system .
a country has already committed to allowing its supreme court to be the ultimate court for this new criminal system .
there are <unk> and city builder that are very interested in the project .
they can even get some funding .
but the only thing we know that they &apos;ve already solved is they have a good number of inhabitants .
there are a lot of companies that want to break into the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there .
in the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to be changed immediately to another place .
there &apos;s a million a year that comes out of latin america to go to the united states .
many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to get a job ; sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make money so they just eat or buy clothes .
sadly , sometimes there are even children trying to meet with their parents who haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , in a decade .
so , what do you think about building a new city in honduras ?
or build a dozen of these , or a hundred of these worldwide ?
what does it seem to you think about trying to make families choice between cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends urged me to say , &quot; thank you ted . &quot;
do you know how many decisions we make one day ?
do you know how much we choose in a week ?
i recently did a survey of over 2,000 people and the average number of choices that says pick an american average , are about 70 a day .
not too long ago , in research , they continued for a week to a group of game presidents .
researchers registered the different task @-@ driven tasks by these executives and the time they were digging into making decisions related to those tasks .
they found that , on average , they found <unk> jobs a week .
naturally , every work included a lot of <unk> .
half of those decisions took nine minutes or so .
only 12 percent it takes an hour or more of its time .
now think about your choices .
do you know how many belong to the age of nine minutes , and how many of an hour ?
how do you deal with the way those choices drive ?
i want to talk today about one of the biggest problems of the day : choice , choice .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
while i &apos;m talking about this , i &apos;m going to ask you a few questions , and i need to know your answers .
when i ask a question , as i &apos;m blind , raise your hand only if you want to burn calories .
otherwise , when you ask a question , if your answer is positive , please have a <unk> .
and now my first question of the day : are you ready to hear about the problem of choice ?
thank you .
being a graduate student at stanford university , we <unk> this very , very high @-@ level grocery store , at least at that time , was very sophisticated .
it was called <unk> .
it was almost like going to an amusement park .
there were about 250 different kinds of mustard and vinegar , over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of bottled water , and this was when we were shooting water .
i loved going to that store , but one time i wondered , why don &apos;t i buy anything ?
this is the olive oil shelf .
they had over 75 different classes , including the ones that were in a sealed box that came out of the trees that were coming out of the aquatic trees .
i once decided to go to the manager and ask , &quot; did you get this strategy to offer all these choices ? &quot;
he pointed to me the buses full of tourists every day , usually with his cameras .
we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> . this is the amoeba .
they had different classes .
we set up a seat for <unk> , right at the entrance to the store .
we put there six tastes there , or 24 different flavors , and we looked at two things : first , what if people were willing to stop and try and grab it ?
more people stopped when there was 24 , 60 percent , than when there were only six , 40 percent .
we also looked at what case they were most likely to buy a <unk> <unk> .
here we find the opposite effect .
of those who stopped when he was 24 , only three percent came to buy <unk> .
the ones who stopped when there were six , we saw that 30 percent bought <unk> .
if we do the calculations , people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were able to find out 24 .
well , to decide that we don &apos;t buy <unk> , we probably want to have a good job of keeping our <unk> , but it turns out that the problem of choosing is really far @-@ reaching decisions .
we decided not to decide , even when this doesn &apos;t hurt us .
now the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , where we look at the decisions about savings in terms of a million americans , out of about 650 plans in this country .
we were interested in seeing if the number of opportunities for cash savings available , the <unk> program , helping people save for the future .
and we found that there was actually a correlation .
we had phenomenal plans that went from two to 59 different options .
we found that the bigger the number of biomedical funds , there were fewer participation .
so , if we look at the edge , we see that on the plans that give two funds , the participation rate was 70 or more , not as high as you would like .
and on the plans that approximately 60 funds , the participation rate brought down to 60 .
it turns out even if you decide to engage , when there &apos;s more options , even in that case , there &apos;s negative consequences .
so , for those who decided to participate , the bigger the number of choices , the more people are empowered to avoid the actions or the investment funds .
as soon as there were more choices , they were more willing to invest in financial accounts .
but none of these extreme decisions are the ones to optimize future wealth .
in the last decade we &apos;ve seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities .
the most likely thing is that it <unk> the decision , that it <unk> it even when it comes against self @-@ interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make the worst decisions ; in finance and health .
they &apos;re more likely to pick things less satisfying , even though objectively they &apos;re better .
the main reason is that we &apos;re going to start looking at that huge array of <unk> , mustard and vinegar , and we &apos;re not able to do the calculations to compare , contrast and choose from that awesome exhibit .
i want to challenge you today four simple techniques that we have tried , in one way or another , in different research , so you can actually test in your business .
the first is cut , cut .
you &apos;ve already heard it before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , which is less .
people always get upset when i say , &quot; cut . &quot;
they care about losing space in <unk> .
but actually , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut , get rid of odd psychological choice , there will be a higher increase in sales , you &apos;ll have a better experience in choice .
when <unk> &amp; amp ; gamble went from 26 different kinds of head &amp; amp ; <unk> 15 , they saw a 10 percent increase in sales .
when the corporation <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> cats who were less sold , they scaled up the slaughter at 87 percent , by two causes : higher sales and lower costs .
you know that the supermarkets today , on average , offer 14,000 products .
in a walmart store , you have about 100,000 products .
but the nine biggest store in the world today is <unk> and only <unk> products ; a type of tomato sauce can .
in the world of financial savings , i think one of the best examples that has emerged out of how to handle the best choices is david <unk> &apos;s argument , the harvard conference .
all the harvard employees are automatically embedded in a safe living fund .
those who really want to pick , give them 20 funds , not 300 or more .
you know , people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to cut .
they &apos;re all important options . &quot;
the first thing i do is ask employees , &quot; tell me the differences between those choices .
and if your employees can &apos;t tell the difference , they can &apos;t make your customers . &quot;
this afternoon , before i started this session , i was talking to gary .
he told me he would be willing to offer the people in this audience a few holidays with all the most beautiful highway in the world .
here , a description .
i want you to read it .
i &apos;m going to leave a few seconds to read it , and then i want you to give it a hand if you &apos;re ready to take the deal of gary .
ok . anyone who &apos;s ready to accept the deal .
aren &apos;t they more ?
well , i &apos;m going to show you something else .
you knew there was a trick .
who &apos;s ready for that journey ?
i think i actually got to hear more hands .
all right .
actually , you had more information in the first round , than in the second round , but i can tell you that you thought the second time was more real .
because the images made it more real .
this brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of <unk> &apos;s overhead , which is <unk> .
so for people to understand the differences between choice , they have to understand the consequences of every choice , and that the consequences have to feel very deeply vivid , very concrete .
why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they &apos;re using credit or credit cards , which when they &apos;re using cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t look real money .
it turns out that making people look more real , it can be a very positive tool for people to hear more .
we did a study with <unk> and <unk> <unk> , on staff of <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were attached to a legal plan .
by that meeting , we had exactly as it was used , we made it an addition .
what we added was that we asked the staff to think about the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were more money .
with this <unk> , there was a spike in 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or whatever they wanted to put in their savings accounts , four percent .
the third technique is to classify .
we can handle more categories than options .
for example , this is a study we did in a magazine hall .
we saw that in the <unk> supermarkets across the corridor of the northeast , the exhibits of magazines can hold different kinds of subjects down to <unk> .
but , you know ?
if i show you 600 journals and i do it on 10 categories , and i compare it to 400 <unk> in 20 groups , you &apos;ll think i &apos;ve offered them more choices and better choice experience if i offer these 400 , which if i put 600 .
because classification tells me how to behave .
these are two jeweled <unk> .
one is called <unk> and the other , <unk> .
if you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> , have a <unk> .
well , there are some .
if you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> , have a <unk> .
well , something else .
it turns out it &apos;s right .
the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> , but you know something ?
this rating scheme is completely useless .
categories need to indicate something that you choose , not what you call them .
you often see this problem with these huge fundraising lists .
allegedly , who are they informing ?
my fourth category : it <unk> complexity .
it turns out we can handle a lot more information than we think , if we just reverse it a little bit .
we have to increase complexity gradually .
i &apos;m going to show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s look at a complicated decision ; buy it from a car .
this is a german car manufacturer that allows you to fully train them .
you have to make 60 decisions , so you have to build the car .
and these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each .
color , outer color in the car . i have 56 possibilities .
engine , change box , four choices .
what i &apos;m going to do is change the order where the decisions appear .
so half the clients are going to go from lots of options , 56 colors , just a few , four boxes .
the other half of the clients are going to go from a few options , four trucks , 56 colors , lots of options .
and what am i going to look at ?
how much you are involved .
if the default button in every decision , this indicates they &apos;re overwhelmed , i mean , we &apos;re losing them .
we found that those who go from lots of choices to a few , press the default button over and over again , and again .
we lose them .
if you go from a few choices to a lot , they continue there .
the same information , the same number of choices .
all i did was <unk> the order where the information is presented .
if we start with the easy thing , you learn to pick .
although the choice of the change box doesn &apos;t say anything about the preferences of interior decoration , in all ways makes us choice .
we &apos;re excited about a product that we &apos;re building that now has more structured with the process .
to sum up .
i &apos;ve talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of choice : cutting , cutting , cutting out strange alternatives ; <unk> them ; make it real ; we can actually drive more categories with less choice ; complexity .
all these techniques that i presented to you were designed to help drive the alternatives , or better , for you , to use them in your business , or for the people who serve .
i think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful to pick .
and the more careful we &apos;ll be in our elections , we &apos;ll be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you very much .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , youtube trends , and i look at youtube videos in a professional way .
it &apos;s true .
so today we &apos;re going to see why video is made viral and how important that is .
we all want to be stars : celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was younger , that seemed very , very difficult .
but today the web video causes any of us or our actions , copper in a part of our global culture .
anyone can be famous on the internet in a <unk> .
over 48 hours to youtube hours per minute .
and , of those , only a small percentage gets viral , they get infinite of views and they win cultural <unk> .
how does that happen ?
three things : makers , community of participation and surprise factor .
well , let &apos;s start .
oh , my god , my god .
oh my god !
wow .
ow , ow !
last year , <unk> <unk> published this video clip outside his house in yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it was seen 23 million times .
this graph shows the views on the rise of popularity of last summer .
<unk> don &apos;t talk about viral video .
i just wanted to share a rainbow twice .
that &apos;s what you do if you &apos;re called yosemite mountain <unk> .
many videos of nature had already published .
this video had been published in january .
so what happened here ?
it was jimmy wales .
jimmy wales published this tweet that <unk> the video to popularity .
makers of trends like jimmy <unk> show us new and interesting things and <unk> them to a wider audience .
it &apos;s friday . you have to start friday . everyone wants the weekend to come , last weekend . friday , starting friday . you wouldn &apos;t think we could have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
&quot; friday &quot; aristotle is one of the most popular videos in the year .
they saw it almost 200 million times this year .
this graph shows the frequency of use .
just like , &quot; fur <unk> , &quot; this video appeared to have emerged out of nowhere .
so , what happened this day ?
well , it was friday , it &apos;s true .
and if you ask for those other peaks , they &apos;re also friday .
but what happened this day , this particular friday ?
well , he took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it .
michael <unk> nelson , at the <unk> science theater , was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on twitter .
but the important thing is that a person or a group of creators embrace a point of view and share it with a wider audience , accelerating the process .
so , this community of people who share this big inner joke , then starts talking about it and doing things .
and now there are 10,000 <unk> of friday on youtube .
just in the first seven days , there was a parody for each of other days .
unlike 20th century entertainment , this communal involvement is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with that .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation with a <unk> music .
so , that &apos;s it .
this year they saw him about 50 million times .
and if you think that &apos;s odd , you know that there &apos;s a three @-@ hour version that &apos;s seen four million times .
even the cats saw this video .
and there are cats who saw other cats watching the video .
but what &apos;s important here is creativity that woke up between the internet <unk> community .
there were <unk> .
someone made an old version .
and then international became international .
suddenly , a whole community of community emerged that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be part of .
because today we don &apos;t just enjoy , we participate .
who could have predicted something like that ?
who could have predicted &quot; <unk> two &quot; or rebecca black or <unk> ?
what a script could have written that this situation would have written ?
in a world where two days of video come up with , just that single , unexpected can tell us the way these things have done .
when a friend told me that i had to see this great video of a guy who runs against the <unk> of bikers in new york , i admit i wasn &apos;t really interested .
i &apos;m criticized for not <unk> , but there are often obstacles that prevent you from being properly <unk> .
thanks to the surprise effect and his humor , casey <unk> managed to get five million people to understand their idea .
so this approach is worth all the new things that we do in a creative way .
and all this leads to a big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
the agents of tendency , the creative community of participation , the totally unexpected , are features of a new kind of media , a new culture , that we all have access to and is the audience that defines popularity .
as i said before , one of the world &apos;s current celebrities , justin named justin , started on youtube .
don &apos;t ask for permission to express their ideas .
now we &apos;re all a little owners of our pop culture .
these are not the characteristics of the old media , they &apos;re just the ones of today &apos;s media , but <unk> the future &apos;s entertainment .
thank you .
how i can dive in 10 minutes about women &apos;s bonds over three generations , how the amazing force of those ties is <unk> in the life of a four @-@ year @-@ old girl , next to her sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the sea of china , more than 30 years ago , having <unk> her life @-@ cycles .
this is not a finished story .
it &apos;s a puzzle that is still <unk> .
let me tell you about some of the pieces .
imagine the first piece : a man who is burning the work of a whole life .
he &apos;s a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been supported by the unique hope of unity and freedom in his country .
<unk> as the communist comes in <unk> , <unk> the fact that his life had been totally in vain .
the words , so long as a friend of mine , now we will .
he was silent .
he died broke through history .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never allowed me to forget her story .
my job was not to let that have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that history tried to hate it , but we enjoyed it .
the next part of the puzzle is about a boat as quietly as the sea is .
my mother , <unk> , was only 18 years old when her father died , and a marriage and two little girls .
for her , life had gone to one task : the escape from her family and a new life in australia .
it was inconceivable for her that she could not do it .
and after a four @-@ year @-@ old <unk> who defies fiction , a boat <unk> into the sea of <unk> ship .
all the adults knew the risks .
the greatest fear was <unk> , rape and death .
like most adults , my mother had a poison <unk> .
if i could catch , we &apos;d like to first take my sister and i , and then she and my grandmother .
my first memories are from that boat , the constant pace of the engine , <unk> it in every wave , and the vast and <unk> horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came several times , but they were <unk> with the <unk> of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and not being able to break for six hours .
but i do remember the lights of the oil rig in front of the coast of malaysia , and the young man who collapsed and died , finishing the journey was too much for him , and the first apple i tried , given by the men on the platform .
no apple then had the same flavor .
after three months in a refugee camp , <unk> in melbourne .
and the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations , shaping a new life together .
we set up in <unk> , a working @-@ class <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrants .
unlike the middle @-@ class suburbs , whose existence i grew , in <unk> , there was no sense of the right .
the smells that came from the shops were of the rest of the world .
and the bits of english are coming in between the people who had a common thing : they were starting fresh .
my mother worked in farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , twice .
yet , he found time to study english and get a title in i.t. .
we were poor .
all the dollars were pouring in , and yet there was an extra record in english and math , they didn &apos;t care what should be removed , which was usually new gear ; it was always hand .
two middle pairs for school , one to hide holes in the other .
a school uniform up to the ankles , because i had to last six years .
and there were freaks and <unk> over the blindfold , and some graffiti : &quot; <unk> , come home . &quot;
where ?
something in me is being celebrated .
i was accumulating determination and a voice saying , &quot; i &apos;m going to fix it . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i <unk> in the same bed .
my mother was devastated every night , but we told us about our day and her grandmother &apos;s movements in the house .
my mother had nightmares , all of the ship .
and my task was to be awake until his nightmares began to be able to save him .
she opened a computer tent , then studied to be a <unk> and opened another business .
and the women were coming with their stories about men who couldn &apos;t make the transition , angry and <unk> , and kids were caught in between two worlds .
they were looking for subsidies and sponsors .
and they created centers .
i lived in parallel worlds .
in one , it was the classic asian student , <unk> with what i disagree with .
on the other hand , i was in <unk> lives , tragically , by violence , abuse of drugs and isolation .
but a lot of help from the years .
and because of that work , when i studied my last year of <unk> , i was elected the early &apos; 70s .
and i was thrown out of a piece of the puzzle to the other , but its edges did not eat .
so le corbusier , <unk> <unk> , was now le <unk> , <unk> and social activist , invited to speak at sites i had never heard before , and in homes whose existence she would never have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know the protocols .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about it .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to retreat into the feet and the comfortable life on a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for nearly 20 years , <unk> on the day of every single and a <unk> , the three still in bed .
and i told my mom i couldn &apos;t do it .
it reminded me that i was right now the same age that she had when we got on the boat .
the &quot; had never been a choice .
&quot; do it , &quot; he said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you don &apos;t know . &quot;
so i talked about juvenile <unk> and education and <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> .
and the more frankly i was talking about , the more i was talking about .
i met people from all the pathways of life , many of them doing what they loved , living on the border of the possible .
and although i finished my undergraduate degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t stay in a career of <unk> .
there had to be another piece of the puzzle .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s well being a stranger , a very recently arrived at the scene -- and not only that it &apos;s okay , but it &apos;s something to be grateful for , maybe a gift of the boat .
because being inside can easily mean <unk> the horizons , it can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your province .
i gave the enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that , yes , the world is silent , but not the way we fear .
possibilities that weren &apos;t <unk> were tremendously <unk> .
there was an energy there , a <unk> optimism , a rare mix of humility and courage .
so i follow my intuition .
i joined a small group of people who the slogan &quot; cannot be done &quot; was a compelling challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a dime .
at the end of every day , he would make a giant soup pot that we all shared .
we worked until the actual entrance to the night .
most of our crazy ideas were crazy , but some brilliant ones , and we opened up .
i made the decision to make the u.s.
after a single trip .
my hunch again .
three months later , i had moved , and adventure continued .
before i finish , let me tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when <unk> was the social norm and local mandarin was the person who cared .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after she was born .
the mother grew up alone .
when he was 17 , he became mandarin <unk> whose mother beat him up .
without the support of her husband , he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and to get the cause of her , and much more <unk> caused when he won .
the &quot; cannot be done , &quot; proved to be wrong .
i was in the shower at a hotel room in sydney when she died , 1,000 miles , in melbourne .
i looked through the shower at the other hand , and i saw her standing on the other side .
i knew i had come to <unk> .
my mother called for minutes later .
days later , we went to a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat around his coffin .
we tell stories and we make sure that we were still with it .
at night a monk came in and told us that he had to close his coffin .
my mother asked us to hold her hand .
he asked the monk , &quot; why is his hand hot , and the rest of the body so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve taken your hand from the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they haven &apos;t <unk> it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a nerve in our family , that runs through women .
given those of us and how life formed us , we can now see that the men who would have reached our lives would have frustrated us .
the defeat would have easily <unk> .
now i want to have my own children , and i ask about the boat .
who could wish for that ?
however , i fear the privilege of the easy , the right .
can i give you a <unk> in your life , diving courageous at every wave , the constant pace of the engine , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give them and see them safe , i would .
<unk> <unk> and also the <unk> mother is here in the fourth or fifth line .
i &apos;m here to share my photography .
or is it a photograph ?
because , of course , they &apos;re pictures that they can &apos;t take with their cameras .
my interest in photography was introduced to my first digital camera to 15 years .
he was frustrated with my passion before the drawing , but he was a little different because using the camera , the process was in planning .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends up when you click the <unk> .
for me photography had more to do with being in the right place , at the right time .
it seemed that anyone could do it .
so i wanted to create something different , a process that started <unk> the <unk> .
pictures like this : a very <unk> road building .
but it has an unexpected turn .
and despite that , it holds a level of <unk> .
or pictures like these dark , colorful pictures at the same time , but with the common goal of keeping the realism level .
and when i say <unk> , i say <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something i can get , but i always want it to seem like i was caught in some way as a photograph .
photos you have to think about a moment to discover the trick .
it has more to do with capturing an idea than capture a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes them look real ?
are the details , or the color ?
does the light intervene ?
what does the illusion create ?
sometimes the illusion is perspective .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a two @-@ dimensional surface .
it &apos;s actually not about whether it &apos;s realistic , it &apos;s about what we think it &apos;s realistic .
so i think the foundations are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality .
let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imaginable , something that we can all relate to the three @-@ dimensional world .
but they combined , in a sense , can create something that still looks three @-@ dimensional -- as if it existed .
but at the same time , we know it doesn &apos;t exist .
so , tell the brain , because the brain doesn &apos;t accept the fact that that doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process by combining pictures .
it really is about combining different realities .
and the things that make a realistic photo seem like , i think , are those in which we don &apos;t even think about -- the things that surround us in our everyday life .
but when we combine pictures , it &apos;s very important to consider it , because otherwise something will look bad .
so i &apos;d like to say that there are three simple rules that we can follow to make realistic results .
as you can see , these images are not very special .
but combined , you can create something like this .
so the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective .
second , pictures combined must have the same kind of light .
and these two pictures play with these requirements ; they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light .
the third thing is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of all different images with a perfect union .
it has to be impossible to see where the image is going to be .
by measuring the color , the contrast and the <unk> on the edges that are in between the images , adding birth defects as depth of field , <unk> colors and noise , <unk> the boundaries between the various images and making it look like one , although a picture can actually have hundreds of layers .
this is another example .
you might think that this is the picture of a landscape and the bottom is being manipulated .
but this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places .
personally , i think it &apos;s easier to create a place that you find out because you don &apos;t have to put your ideas in the head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and as i thought about this idea in winter , i knew that i had several months to get them , to find the different locations for the puzzle pieces .
for example , the fish was captured on a fishing journey .
the shoreline is from a different location .
the <unk> part was captured in a stone pit .
and yes , i even did the red house on the top of the island so it sounds more swedish .
so to make a realistic result , i think we need planning .
you always start with a sketch , an idea .
then you have to combine the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well known .
if you do a good job by taking the photos , the outcome can be very beautiful and very realistic .
all the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about why a lot of projects of health care fail .
and i think , really , the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients .
and one of the things we did at <unk> university was we <unk> a director of the listening .
and not in a very scientific way , she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients , family and known , &quot; what &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
&quot; how can we help it ? &quot;
and we tend to think , this is one of the biggest problems that everyone , or maybe not all , but most of the projects of health and wellness , because we stop listening .
this is my logarithmic scale . it &apos;s a very simple thing .
it has a flip switch and off .
every morning i go up .
and yes , i have a challenge as you can see .
i got the challenge of getting 95 kilograms .
but it &apos;s so simple , that every time i link to , it sends my information to google health .
and my doctor at <unk> has access to him too . so , he can see what my weight problem is , not at the same time when he needs <unk> or some <unk> of that style , but to see him backwards .
but there &apos;s another thing .
as some of you know , i have over 4,000 followers on twitter .
so , every morning i link to you on a scale of wi @-@ fi , and before i get up to my car , people start telling me , &quot; <unk> , today i think you need a light lunch . &quot;
that &apos;s the best thing that can happen , because it &apos;s peer pressure , used to help patients , because it could be used for obesity , and also for patients to stop smoking .
on the other hand , it can rotate to move people from their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health .
from the next week , it will be available .
this little <unk> connected to an iphone or another device .
and people can , from their homes , take their blood pressure , send it to their doctor , share it with others , for example , for 100 dollars .
this is the point where patients assume a position , they come back to <unk> control and to be ship captains , but it can also help us care of health because of the challenges that we face , like the firing of the cost of care costs , demand and other issues .
making techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team .
and you can do it with techniques like this , but also by crowdsourcing .
and one of the things we did want to share with you with a video .
we all have car navigation controls .
maybe we even have them in our cell phones .
we know perfectly where atm machines are .
also where are all the <unk> .
and of course , we can find fast food chains .
but where is the closest <unk> to help this patient ?
we didn &apos;t know .
nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now .
what we did was , we <unk> the netherlands .
we create a website , and we asked the public to say , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please tell us where , and when it &apos;s open , &quot; because sometimes you open office schedules and others are closed .
and over 10,000 <unk> already were introduced in the netherlands .
the next step was looking for the application for that .
and we did an app for the ipad .
we create an app for <unk> , augmented reality , to find these augmented reality .
and every time you &apos;re in the city of <unk> and someone &apos;s collapses , you can use your iphone , and within weeks , use your microsoft &apos;s cell phone to find the nearest <unk> , which can save lives .
and from today , i would like to present this one , not just as <unk> <unk> , which is the name of the product , but also as <unk> .
and we <unk> globally .
we &apos;re sending all the colleagues in the world , in other universities , to help us find , work and act as a hub for the throughout the world .
every time you &apos;re on holiday and someone , it may be a relative or someone in front of you , you can find it .
i also would like to invite companies around the world that they could help us deal with these <unk> .
they could be fedex or phone services , for example , to see whether or not the <unk> that shows is still in place .
please , focus on this and not only improve health , but taking control of it .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the solar technology industry .
and my little company is trying to engage with the environment that &apos;s focused on ...
the distributed collaboration .
this is a little video of what we do .
mm : wait a minute .
you can take a little bit of charge .
we can -- we can continue -- we better leave the video on the side ...
no .
this is not ...
all right .
solar technology is ...
oh , you know , i &apos;m running out of time ?
all right . thank you very much .
a couple of years ago , i set up an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians so that they take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to engage , and we asked them to work in the government .
the initiative was called america &apos;s code , and it would be like some peace <unk> .
we pick a few members every year and put them work with the municipalities .
instead of sending them to the third world , we send them to the wild @-@ city world .
they made big apps ; they worked with the employees <unk> .
his homework is about today &apos;s possibilities for technology .
meet al .
it &apos;s a fire hydrant from the city of boston .
here comes as if i look for a quote , but what it really looks for is that someone who has been <unk> by snow , because he knows it &apos;s not very good at putting fires when it &apos;s covered by a foot of snow .
how did it get to ask help in this particular way ?
last year in boston , we had a team of members of code for america .
they were there in february , and at that time they weren &apos;t doing much last year .
they realized that the city never wiped these <unk> .
but one of the members called erik <unk> @-@ <unk> noticed something more : citizens compared to <unk> the sidewalks in front of them .
so he did as any good programmer , he developed an app .
it &apos;s a nice application in which you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you hold <unk> when you win .
when you do , you put a name on it , in this case you put al .
if you don &apos;t , someone can fake it .
i mean , it has a playful component .
it &apos;s a modest application .
maybe it &apos;s the youngest of the 21 applications that are going on last year .
but it does something that no other government technology does .
and it spreads viral .
a responsible driver of <unk> &apos;s city when he saw this application , he realized he could use it , not for snow , but for citizens to embrace the tsunami .
it &apos;s very important that these tar sands work , but people steal batteries .
so he asks the citizens to control them .
and then seattle decided to use it to get the citizens to prescribe the <unk> .
and chicago has just been thrown out to get people to clear sidewalks when they were diving .
so now we know nine cities that we can use it .
and this has spread out <unk> , organically and natural ways .
if you know a little bit of government technology , you &apos;ll know that this doesn &apos;t happen normally .
software acquisition usually takes a couple of years .
last year in boston , we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months .
it was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children .
then we were told that , in fact , for the normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and a half million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing .
now there &apos;s a project in the california <unk> that has , until the time , two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that shows up in a couple of days and spreads in viral form is a kind of warning about the institution of government .
it suggests the best way to work , not as private companies , as many people think it should be .
neither as a technology company , but rather as the internet itself .
that is , without restrictions , in an open and understandable way .
and that &apos;s important .
but the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way of addressing the question of government that has the new generation -- not as a problem of an institution -- but as a collective action problem .
and that &apos;s very good because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
and there &apos;s a very large community of people who are building the tools to build them together effectively .
and it &apos;s not just america &apos;s code , but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to civic apps every day in their own communities .
they haven &apos;t given up with government .
they feel great frustration to that , but they don &apos;t complain , they fix it .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from sight .
and that is , if we stop the feelings about politics , row in the front lines and all those other things that put us crazy , the government is essentially , in the words of tim o <unk> : &quot; what we do together because we cannot . &quot;
now , many people have cleaned up the government .
if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask you to reform it , because things are changing .
politics does not change ; government does .
and because the government ultimately generates of us -- remember that from &quot; we , the village ? the way we think about it will affect the way we make change .
i didn &apos;t know a lot about government when i started with this .
and as a lot of people thought that the government was about choice for people to vote up .
well , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that government is , above all , a question of governance .
this is the website of service and information .
it &apos;s the place that manages phone calls if you mark <unk> in america .
if you ever have the opportunity to work in a city call center like scott <unk> as part of this initiative -- in fact , everybody will find that people call the government with a very broad range of issues , even when it finds a <unk> in the house .
scott <unk> this call .
<unk> entered the official knowledge base .
he found nothing . he started with animal control .
and finally he said , &quot; hey , can you open the doors of the house , put quiet music and see if it &apos;s gone ? &quot;
and it worked . so , scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the chicken .
boston has no call center .
it has an app , web and mobile , called <unk> .
don &apos;t give that application .
it was the work of very smart people at the office of new zealand .
one day , this really happened , came up with this request , &quot; <unk> in my garbage cube . i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s dead .
how do i make it for ? &quot;
<unk> &apos;s dynamic is different .
scott was talking in person .
<unk> <unk> is all public , so everyone can see this .
in this case , he saw a neighbor .
the next report said , &quot; i approached the site , i found the garbage cube behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . yes .
i turned the bucket . i went home .
good evening , sweet <unk> . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the confluence of digital and physical .
and it &apos;s also a great example of government &apos;s income to distributed collaboration .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean the technological definition of platform .
i talk about a platform for people to come and help others .
so , a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role .
he connected the two people .
and it could be connected with government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than government services .
when a neighbor helps another , it <unk> communities .
if we call animal control , that costs a lot of money .
one important thing we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same as politics .
a lot of people understand it , but think one is the input from the other .
our entry into the government system is voting .
how many times have you chosen a political leader , sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we expect the government to <unk> our values and challenge our needs , but then we don &apos;t see changes .
that &apos;s because government is like huge ocean and politics is the surface of 15 inches .
below that &apos;s what we call bureaucracy .
and we say that word with a lot of contempt .
but it &apos;s that contempt that keeps what that belongs to us that we actually fund as something that operates against us , that other thing , and therefore we &apos;re losing power .
people think politics is sensual .
if we want this institution to work , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real government work happens .
we have to collaborate with government machinery .
that makes <unk> motion .
have you seen them ?
it &apos;s a group of citizens concerned that they &apos;ve written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the <unk> of the financial reform project .
that &apos;s not political activism , it &apos;s bureaucratic activism .
and for those of us who are <unk> to government , it &apos;s time for us to ask what world we want to leave our children .
you have to see the huge challenges that they have to deal with .
do you really think we &apos;re going to get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act in the name of everyone ?
we cannot do without government , we need it to be more effective .
the good news is that with technology , it is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand the civil society .
there &apos;s a generation that grew up with the internet and he knows that it &apos;s not that hard to act <unk> , you just have to articulate the systems in the right way .
the average age of our members is 28 years old , so i , <unk> , i &apos;m a bigger generation than many of them .
this is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost by sitting .
they &apos;re not giving that battle that we all face about who &apos;s going to talk about ; they &apos;re all going to talk .
they can express their views on any channel at the same time and do .
so when they face the government problem , they don &apos;t really care about making their voices heard .
they &apos;re using their hands .
they put hands on the work to program applications that will make government better .
and those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities .
it can be stored a fire hydrant , taking weeds , casting a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside .
of course , we were always able to have those <unk> and a lot of people do .
but these applications are like digital <unk> that we &apos;re not only consumers , we &apos;re not just consumers of government who pay taxes and we get services .
we &apos;re more than that : we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to fix the government until we don &apos;t raise citizenship .
so i want to ask everybody here , when it comes to the important things that we have to do together , all together , will we be a crowd of voices , or will we also be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
i usually try to explain to people the wonderful thing that &apos;s going to be the new technologies that are emerging . you have to look backwards to understand what &apos;s happening . here among friends , i want to tell you what i think about these big technological advances , so <unk> that we can barely slow down .
i &apos;m going to start by showing you a slide about technology , very boring .
please , if you can put it ...
it &apos;s a diagram anyone i took from a folder .
i &apos;m not so interested in showing you the details , but the general aspect .
this is an analysis we were doing on the power of <unk> microprocessors versus the power of local area networks .
what &apos;s interesting about this is that this , as many other people we tend to see , is a straight line on a log scale .
in other words , every step here represents an order of magnitude in the yield scale .
talking about technology with cyclical curves is something new .
here &apos;s a strange thing .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m going to talk about .
please light up the lights .
it would need more intensity because it lacked paper .
why would you change technological curves on the <unk> ?
the answer is , if you were to draw them on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , these are the years , or some unit of time , and this would be any measure of the technology that i would like , the diagram would look ridiculous .
it would be something like that .
it doesn &apos;t say much .
but if we were , for example , some other technology , like transportation , on a curved curve would be very dumb , we would see a straight line .
but if something like this happens , you have a qualitative change .
if the technology of transportation would be as fast as the microprocessors , past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in tokyo in 30 seconds .
but it doesn &apos;t go through that pace .
there is no precedent in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years advance the orders of magnitude .
the question i want to make is -- we look at these exponential curves , we see they &apos;re not on forever .
you can &apos;t hold this change as fast as it goes .
it will happen one of two things .
or it will become a typical s @-@ curves like that until something completely different comes out , or maybe it will do something like that .
that &apos;s all that can happen .
i &apos;m optimistic , so i think maybe something will happen .
if we were , now we would be in the middle of a transition .
in this line , we &apos;re in a transition from what used to be the world , to a new way .
so what i &apos;m trying to ask , and to ask myself , is : what is that new way around the world ?
where is the new state going ?
the transition seems very , very confusing if we &apos;re embedded in it .
i remember as a child , the future was going on in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
this is a conference where people talk about the future , and we see the future is still 2000 .
that &apos;s all we see .
in other words , the future has collapsed , year after year , throughout my life .
but i think it &apos;s because we feel something &apos;s going on .
a transformation happens . we can feel it .
and we know that it doesn &apos;t make a lot of sense to think 30 or 50 years , because it &apos;s all going to be so different that we &apos;re doing today doesn &apos;t make any sense .
so i want to talk to you about how that might be , how could that transition that we experience .
but to do that , i &apos;ll have to talk a little bit about things that don &apos;t have a lot to do with technology and computers .
because i think the only way to understand it is to take away and look at long @-@ term things .
the time scale i &apos;d like to do that is the time of life on earth .
i think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years .
so , we go back about 2.5 billion years when the earth was a big barren rock with a lot of chemicals that migrated around it .
if we look at the way those chemicals organized , we give ourselves an idea of how things happened .
and i think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of rna . i &apos;m going to tell you a simple version of this , and that is that , at the time , there were some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside .
some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and grew the blobs grew up .
and they started division .
in a sense , those were the most primitive cell forms ; those oil <unk> .
but those drops were not alive , in the current sense , because each of them had a random prescription of chemicals .
and every time it was cleared , an unequal distribution of chemicals that were contained .
so every single <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the drops that somehow were better than an hour of delivering the chemicals around ; they grew more , they planted more chemicals and became more chemical .
they usually lived longer ; they were more represented .
it was a form of life , chemistry life , very simple chemistry , but things got interesting when these blobs learned the trick of abstraction .
in a way that we don &apos;t really understand very well , they learned how to store information .
they learned to store information , which was the recipe for the cell , in a special chemical called dna .
in other words , <unk> in this completely pointless evolution , a writing system that allowed them to record what was amazing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved 2.5 million years .
our recipe , our genes , have exactly the same code , that same writing system .
in fact , every living being expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
and one of the things i did just for fun -- we can now write things with this code .
here i have 100 <unk> of white dust that i try to hide people from airport security .
but it contains -- <unk> this code -- the code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and i wrote my personal data in this little clip of dna , and we gave it 10 to 22 times .
so if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card , i have many for everyone here -- in fact , for every person in the world and is here .
if he was a <unk> , he would have put him in a virus and he would have spread it in the room .
what was the next step ?
writing dna was an interesting step .
this made these cells happy to be happy another billion years .
but then another big interesting step in which things got really different , and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information to form cells .
i don &apos;t know if you know it , but bacteria can exchange dna .
so , for example , evolving antibiotic resistance .
some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and train them to create their little dna with other bacteria and now there &apos;s a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate .
this communication gave rise to communities that , in a way , were put together in that , and established a synergy .
so whether or not a community was born together , whether a community was very successful , all individuals in that community were getting more and more <unk> by evolution .
and the turning point occurred when these communities moved so long that , in fact , they came together and decided to write the whole prescription of the community into a string of dna .
the next interesting stage for life took another billion years .
and at that stage , we have <unk> communities , communities of many different kinds of cells working together as one organism alone .
in fact , we are a <unk> community .
we have lots of cells that don &apos;t act alone .
the skin cell does not serve without the heart , or the muscle cell , or the brain , etc .
so , these communities evolved and more interesting levels than the cell , something we call an organism .
the next level occurred within these communities .
these started <unk> information .
and building very special structures that they didn &apos;t do more than process information in community .
these are the neural structures .
neurons are the devices that process information that those mobile communities built .
in fact , they started <unk> within the community being responsible for processing structures , understanding and transmit information .
those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that moment as individuals -- learning was confined to the duration of an organism , and not the evolutionary period .
so , an organism could , for example , learn not to eat any fruit , because he knew bad and got sick the last time he ate it .
that could happen during the life of an organism , because they had previously built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruits .
so the fact that the nervous system built those information structures enormously aroused the evolutionary process .
because evolution could now happen confined to an individual .
it could happen in time necessary to learn .
but then , of course , the individuals discovered the communication trick .
so , for example , the most refined version we know is human language .
if we think about it , it &apos;s an amazing invention .
i have a very complicated idea , a vague idea in my head .
i &apos;m here sitting emitting some <unk> and , hopefully , building a similar idea , vague and fuzzy idea in his head that keeps some analogy to mine .
but we took something very complicated , we converted it into sound , in sound sequences , and we produce something very complicated in another brain .
that now allows us to start working as an organism .
in fact , as humanity , we &apos;ve started doing <unk> .
now we go through very similar periods to the multicellular organisms ; we prescribe our record methods , presentation and information processing .
for example , the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
computer telephony , computer computing , video tape , cd @-@ rom , and so on , are the specialized mechanisms that we &apos;re now building that information .
and that brings us into something much bigger , faster and able to evolve more than we did before .
now evolution can happen at microseconds .
you saw the evolutionary <unk> in which there was some evolution with the <unk> program , before our eyes .
and now we have accelerated time scales again .
the first stages of the story that led to a billion years each .
the next stages , the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
the next , language and so on , they took less than a million years .
and the next , like electronics , it just seems to take a few decades .
the process <unk> ; i guess self @-@ organizing is the right word for something that accelerates its own pace of change .
the more it changes , the faster it does .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at in this explosion of the curve .
we see the process <unk> .
but i make a living by designing computers , and i know that the job mechanisms for <unk> may not be possible without the recent computer advances .
but now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to engage in a conventional way .
i don &apos;t know each transistor does in that coding machine .
there are billions .
instead , with the <unk> designers , we think of a level of abstraction , we put it in the machine and the machine that does something that you couldn &apos;t before , it gets much further and faster than ever before .
in fact , sometimes it uses methods that we don &apos;t even understand .
a particularly interesting method , which i &apos;ve been using lately is evolution itself .
inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds .
and , for example , in the most extreme cases , we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions .
we say , &quot; for computer , can you run a hundred million random instructions ?
would you run these sequences of random instructions , run all those programs , and take those that we want to convey what we want to do ? &quot;
in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say i want to order numbers , to put a simple example .
so , we found the programs that get closer to <unk> numbers .
of course , it &apos;s unlikely some random instruction sequences , <unk> numbers , so none of them did .
but one , fortunately , could put two numbers in the right order .
and i said , &quot; computer , could you take 10 percent of those random random random sequences they did the task ?
we induce those and others .
and now they best ordered the numbers .
and let &apos;s go back to looking at an analog process to sex . &quot;
let &apos;s take two programs , we &apos;ll test kids , we &apos;ll save them , and we &apos;ll test the properties of both programs .
so we got a new generation of software programs that had a little more success .
and we say , &quot; please repeat the process . &quot;
try it again .
you put in some mutations .
and he tries again and he <unk> with another generation .
well , every generation takes a few milliseconds .
so , i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or , in complicated cases , in a few hours .
in the end , we ended up with software that orders numbers absolutely perfect .
in fact , these are much more efficient programs than i could have written by hand .
if i look at those programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to analyze it to see how they work .
these are dark programs , strangers .
but they are doing the job .
in fact , i know , i have the security that they achieve the goal because they come from a hundred @-@ thousand software lineage that they did .
in fact , his life @-@ saving lives .
once i went on a 747 with ubuntu and figures out a card and says , &quot; look at this .
he says , &quot; this plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a safe flight . does it make you feel quiet ? &quot;
we know that engineering processes don &apos;t work very well when they become complicated .
so we started to rely on computers to make very different design processes .
and that allows us to produce much more complex things than normal engineering .
however , we don &apos;t understand all the choices there are .
in that respect , it goes ahead of us .
now we use these programs to make much quicker computers , so we can run these programs much faster .
i mean , it &apos;s <unk> .
the thing gets faster and faster , and i think it looks so fuzzy .
because all these technologies are getting tired .
we are drowning .
and we &apos;re at an analogous moment to the grid organisms when they become multicellular .
we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t understand what the hell we &apos;re creating .
we &apos;re at the tipping point .
but i think something comes behind us .
i think it would be really arrogant about our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution .
and i think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it comes .
but now lunch comes , and i think i stop here before i get sick .
my story starts at <unk> about two years ago .
i was in the desert , under the <unk> skies , with the evangelical democratic singer .
we were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of the former indian <unk> &quot; the mahabharata . &quot;
in those days when indians wanted to travel , we wanted to ride a car and remove the sky .
now we do it with airplanes .
at that time when <unk> , the great indian warrior , had thirst , took out a bow and with a <unk> on the ground , he got water .
now we do the same thing with <unk> and machines .
the conclusion we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic .
and that gave me a lot of fun .
every time i felt a little more about myself .
i was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if i didn &apos;t have the camera , if i couldn &apos;t afford my friends .
it seemed to me that technology had to allow magic , not succeeding .
as a child , my grandfather gave me his silver <unk> .
and this 50 @-@ year @-@ old piece of technology was for my most magic thing .
it became a golden gateway to a world full of images , of pirates and <unk> in my imagination .
i had the feeling that mobile phone , luxury clocks , and the cameras keep pouring in .
we <unk> our inspiration .
so i set out , i jumped into this technological world to see how to use it to create magic , rather than owning it .
i &apos;m illustrating books since 16 years .
so when i saw the ipad , i saw a storytelling device able to connect readers of the whole world .
you can know how we take the book .
where we are .
gather the text with the image , the animation , the sound and touch .
storytelling becomes increasingly <unk> .
but what &apos;s good for us ?
i &apos;m about to launch <unk> , an interactive app for ipad .
he says , &quot; puts your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- <unk> : &quot; this box belongs to &quot; -- i write my name .
and so i come back with a character of the book .
in a number of moments , i have an <unk> -- the ipad knows where i live from gps -- which comes to me .
my inner child gets excited with all these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
and i don &apos;t mean magicians and dragons , but that magic of childhood , those ideas that arise from children .
for some reason , fireflies in a jar were always exciting to me .
so , over here , we have to <unk> the ipad to release fireflies .
and , really , they light your way in which i rest the book .
another idea that i was fascinated with as a child was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk> .
so here , every book and every world transforms into a <unk> that i <unk> into this magic device inside the device .
and this opens up a map .
in every fantasy book , there have always been maps , but there have been synthetic maps .
this is a map that grows , <unk> and guide you through the rest of the book .
in certain points of the book , it also reveals .
now i &apos;m going to go in .
another extremely important aspect to me is to create indian content and contemporary time .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> , but how many people outside india know their indian counterparts , the <unk> ?
these poor <unk> have been trapped in the hall cameras for millennia , in an old , clean book .
so we &apos;re bringing them back into a contemporary child history .
in a story that deals with issues like the environmental crisis .
and , speaking of the environmental crisis , one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been locked up , glued to their pcs , have not gone outside the world .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids out to the natural world with their technology .
one of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go outside , take the camera or the ipad , and gather images of different natural objects .
as a child , i had lots of collections : sticks , stones , <unk> and shells .
for some reason kids don &apos;t .
so to reclaim this ritual of childhood , you have to go out and , in a chapter , we have a photo of a flower and then replicate it .
in another chapter , you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk> .
so you create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put on the web .
a kid in london puts a picture of a fox and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox . &quot;
a boy in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey today . &quot;
and you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taken .
within the variants of connection between magic , earth and technology , there are many possibilities .
in the next book , we have an interaction where you come out with the ipad and the video switched on and augmented actually you see a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inside of the house .
in a moment , the screen is full of leaves .
and you have to make the sound of the wind and the <unk> so you can read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology are reaching each other .
we take advantage of the energy of the sun .
we &apos;re approaching our children and ourselves , the natural world and that magic , joy and child love that we feel through a simple story .
thank you .
this is for me a real honor .
i &apos;ve spent most of the time in prisons , prisons and death row .
i &apos;ve spent most of my life in <unk> communities , projects and places where there is so much despair .
and being here at ted watching and hearing these stimuli have given me a lot of energy .
one of the things i &apos;ve noticed in this short time is that ted has identity .
and the things that are said here have impacts all over the world .
occasionally , if something comes from ted , it has a sense and a force that would not have otherwise .
i say this because i think identity is important .
here we &apos;ve seen fantastic presentations .
and i think we &apos;ve learned that words from a teacher can make a lot of sense , but if you &apos;re taught with feeling , you can have a special meaning .
a doctor can do good things , <unk> if it &apos;s <unk> , can do much more .
so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t really learn this in the practice of the right , my job .
i learned it from my grandmother .
i grew up in a traditional american family of an african @-@ american family dominated by a wolves , who was my grandmother .
it was hard ; it was hard ; it had power .
it was the last word in the entire family &apos;s discussion .
she <unk> many of the founders in our home .
he was a daughter of people who had been slaves .
his parents were born in slavery in virginia over the 1840 .
she was born on the 1880 and her experience with slavery in a way of looking at the world .
she was hard , but she was also loving .
when i was little and i looked at her , she would come up and give me a good hug .
i was so strong that i could barely breathe and then i was overwhelmed .
one or two hours later , she would come back and look at her , she would come up and say , &quot; <unk> , do you still feel my hug ? &quot;
and if i told him no , he grabs me again and he would say yes , he would let me in peace .
i had this human quality that made you want to always be near it .
the only problem is i had 10 kids .
my mother was the youngest of 10 .
occasionally , when i was going to spend a time with her , it wasn &apos;t easy to catch your time and your attention .
my cousins were running all over the place .
i remember when i was eight or nine years old , i woke up one morning , i went to the room and they were running all my cousins .
my grandmother was on the other side of the room and stare at me .
at first i thought it was a game .
so i looked at her and looked at her , but she was very serious .
after 15 or 20 minutes , she got up , walks across the room , took me out of her hand and said , &quot; come <unk> . we &apos;re going to discuss them . &quot;
i remember this as it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget .
it took me outside and said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you can &apos;t tell anyone . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
she said , &quot; now we &apos;ll act you won &apos;t . &quot; i said , &quot; sure . &quot;
then he sat me down , and he said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
and he said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
he said , &quot; i think you can do whatever you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget .
then he said , &quot; i just want you to get me three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; oh , sure . &quot;
and he said , &quot; the first thing i want you to focus on is that we always want your mother . &quot;
he said , &quot; she &apos;s my <unk> , and you &apos;ve got to make sure you always wear her . &quot;
as i yell at my mom , i said , &quot; yes , <unk> , i will . &quot;
then he said , &quot; the second thing i want you to focus on is you &apos;ll always do the right thing , although the right thing is difficult . &quot;
i thought about it , i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;ll pray . i will . &quot;
then finally , he said , &quot; the third thing i want you to get me is that i never eat alcohol . &quot;
i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , <unk> , i will . &quot;
i grew up in the field , in the south . i have a brother a year older and sister a less year .
when i was 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home with a six @-@ beers , i don &apos;t know where he got it , he grabs my sister and i left for the forest .
we just get the crazy stuff up .
he took a sip of beer , offered my sister , she took a little bit and offered me to me .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . you follow , but i &apos;m not going to take beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; go for it . we always pray it . and you always do the same as we do .
i &apos;ve already taken something , your sister , too . take a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; no . i won &apos;t feel good . you can follow . &quot;
then my brother looks at me .
and he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? take a beer . &quot;
i went in and stood up , and he went , &quot; oh , it &apos;s not going to be thinking about the conversation with <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; but what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; but breast tells all the grandchildren that are special . &quot;
i was terrified .
i have to admit something to you .
i &apos;ll tell you something i probably shouldn &apos;t say .
i know this is widely <unk> .
but i have 52 years , and i can admit i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say this by thinking it &apos;s a virtue ; i say by the power of identity .
when we create the right type of identity , we say things to others that really don &apos;t make sense .
we can &apos;t get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
i think my grandmother naturally believed that all her grandchildren were special .
my grandfather had been convicted during the court .
my uncles died of diseases related to alcohol .
and these were the things that , according to her , we had to commit .
now , i &apos;m going to try and talk about our criminal justice system .
this country is today very different than it was 40 years ago .
in 1972 , there were 300,000 prisoners .
today , there are 2.3 million .
in america , we have the largest incarceration rate in the world .
we have seven million people in liberty .
and this mass incarceration , in my view , has fundamentally changed our world .
in poor , black communities , you find so much <unk> , so much despair , determined by these facts .
one out of three black people between 18 and 30 years is in jail or in liberty .
in urban <unk> across the country , los angeles , philadelphia , baltimore , washington , 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail or in freedom .
our system is not only distorted in front of the race , but it &apos;s also about poverty .
in this country , we have a criminal system that treat you much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty , that if you &apos;re poor and innocent .
it &apos;s not guilt ; it &apos;s wealth that affects outcomes .
and we seem to feel very calm .
the politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems with us .
we &apos;re disconnected .
i think it &apos;s interesting .
we &apos;re looking at our work , some pretty curious developments .
in my state , in alabama , just as in other states , you will be charged with rights forever if you have a criminal conviction .
right now in alabama , 34 percent of the black population has definitely lost the right to vote .
and if we toss it to the next 10 years , the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before we <unk> the law of the right to vote .
we have this amazing silence .
i play children .
many of my clients are very young .
america is the only country in the world where 13 @-@ year @-@ old children die in prison .
we have in this country of prison for children , unable to get out .
right now , we &apos;re in process of some litigation .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in the death row .
this issue of death penalty is interesting .
in a sense , we have <unk> to think that the ultimate question is , do people deserve to die for the ultimate <unk> ?
a very sensitive question .
but you can think differently about how we are in our identity .
there &apos;s another way of looking at it : it &apos;s not about deciding whether people deserve to die for their crimes that we deserve to kill .
this is interesting .
death penalty in america is defined by mistake .
of every nine people who have drunk people , they have identified one that is innocent that it is <unk> and released from the death row .
an error rate , astonishing -- an innocent rate of every nine .
this is interesting .
in aviation , you would never be able to never afford airplanes if of every nine you would be arrested , you would have <unk> .
but somehow we get sick of the problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these things .
i talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill .
it &apos;s interesting that in my classes with african @-@ american students , i talk about slavery .
i talk to you about terrorism , the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and lasted to world war ii .
we really don &apos;t know much about this .
but for black americans in this country , it was a seminal time defined by terror .
in many communities , people were afraid of being <unk> .
they were worried to be angry .
the terror threat was what defined their lives .
now , there are older people who come up to me and say , &quot; mr. <unk> , you &apos;re telling talks , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re giving talks to people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism for the first time , after 11 o &apos;clock . &quot;
they ask me to say , &quot; no . say we grew up with that . &quot;
the age of terrorism went on , obviously , with <unk> and decades of rape and separation .
in this country , we have a dynamic where we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we haven &apos;t understood the meaning of what we have historically done .
all the time we spend each other .
we constantly create tensions and conflict .
it costs us to talk about races . i think it is because we &apos;re not prepared to engage with a real and reconciliation process .
in south africa , people understood that you couldn &apos;t overcome racial <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
in rwanda , even before the genocide had this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done it .
i was in germany giving talks about the death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s very troubling to listen to what you say . &quot;
he said , &quot; we don &apos;t have a death penalty in germany .
we can &apos;t naturally have it here . &quot;
the room was silent and a lady said , &quot; there &apos;s no way for our history , we can never get into the systematic death of human beings .
it would be irrational that we , intentional and <unk> , we were going to run people . &quot;
tell us about this .
how would we feel in a world where a nation like germany , <unk> people , especially if they were in their majority jews ?
we couldn &apos;t tolerate it .
it would be irrational .
and yet , in this country , in the former south states , we &apos;re still running for people . in the same areas where 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white , that if it were black , it &apos;s more likely to be black , if it &apos;s black , and its <unk> is white , in the same states that are buried in .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
i think our identity is in danger .
if we don &apos;t really care about these issues as difficult , positive and wonderful things are , however , intractable .
we love innovation .
we &apos;re fascinated with technology . we worship creativity .
we love entertainment .
but lately , those are well @-@ known realities for suffering , abuse , degradation , <unk> .
in my view , we need to integrate both things .
we talk about the need to have more hope , more commitment , more dedication to the basic challenges of life in this complex world .
i think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor , the <unk> , those who never get to ted .
to think about them , in a sense , something that is within our being .
we really have to believe in issues that we haven &apos;t seen .
so we are . despite being so rational , so committed to intellectual .
with innovation , with creativity . development comes not just brain ideas .
these things come from pleasant ideas , also by the heart convictions .
this connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look not only at the brilliant , but also the dark and the difficult .
<unk> <unk> , the great sufi leader , talked about this .
he said , &quot; when we were in eastern europe suffering , we wanted all sorts of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , guidance for the spirit , a willingness to be in sites of despair and being witnesses . &quot;
well , that guidance for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what i think is still in communities like ted , has to engage us .
there is no disconnect related to technology and design , which allows us to truly be human if we don &apos;t pay attention to poverty , at <unk> , to inequality , to injustice .
now i want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we neglect these things .
we go back to them .
i had the great privilege , being a very young lawyer , to meet <unk> <unk> .
she came to meet with some frequency , to come up with two of her closest friends , older ladies , <unk> who had organized the <unk> to the buses of <unk> , a wonderful lady , and virginia <unk> , a white lady , whose husband , <unk> , was dr. king &apos;s lawyer .
these women were just getting together to talk .
occasionally , the lady would call me , to tell me , &quot; listen , lady comes in . we &apos;re going to get together to talk .
do you want to come and listen ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . yes i want . &quot;
so she said , &quot; well , what are you going to do when you came ? &quot;
i would say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so i was going and i just listened to them .
it was very <unk> , very <unk> .
and one time i was there , listening to these ladies , and after a couple of hours , ms. dilma rousseff turned to me and said , &quot; now , <unk> , that is that idea of fairness .
tell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
and i started giving my speech .
i said , &quot; well , we &apos;re trying to question injustice .
we try to help those who have been convicted .
we try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice management .
we try to end with life sentences , without freedom from children .
we try to do something about death penalty .
we try to reduce the population in prison .
we try to end with massive <unk> . &quot;
i gave him all my best speech and finally he looked at me and said , &quot; hmm . &quot;
and he said , &quot; let &apos;s march off , very much . &quot;
and at that time , ms. leaned over , puts my finger in the face , and said , &quot; it &apos;s why you have to be very , very brave . &quot;
i think actually , the ted community has to be much more structured .
we have to find a way to deal with those challenges , those problems , that suffering .
because finally , humanity depends on compassion for others .
i &apos;ve learned some very simple things in my work .
i &apos;ve been interested in simple things .
i &apos;ve come to understand and believe that each of us is upper to the worst we &apos;ve ever made .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
i believe that if someone says a lie , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s a liar .
i &apos;m sure if you take something that doesn &apos;t belong to you , it &apos;s not that you are a thief .
even if someone kills another , it &apos;s not a killer .
so i think there &apos;s a basic dignity in people who have to be <unk> by the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country and , surely , many parts of the world , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
that &apos;s not it .
i really think many parts the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think it &apos;s very dramatic , very beautiful , very <unk> , very encouraging , we don &apos;t get distracted by our technology , by our designs , not by our intellectual ability or rational ability .
ultimately , the character of a society , not the way they treat the rich , powerful and privileged , but the way they treat the poor , the doomed , the prisoners .
because it &apos;s in this context as we start to understand truly deep topics about what we are .
sometimes i feel <unk> . i &apos;m going to end with a story .
sometimes i make too much force .
you &apos;re tired , like everyone .
sometimes those ideas go beyond my stories into a major way .
i &apos;ve been representing these kids who have been trafficked with a lot of <unk> .
i go to jail and i see my 13 and 14 @-@ year @-@ old clients who have been honored to make them as adults as adults .
and i start thinking , how can it be ?
how can a judge turn someone into what &apos;s not ?
judge <unk> him as an adult , but i see a child .
one night very late , i was awake thinking -- for god , if the judge can turn you into something that you are not , you must have magical powers .
<unk> , <unk> , the judge has magic powers .
you should ask for some of that .
as it was too late , i couldn &apos;t think properly , but i started working in a <unk> .
he had a 14 @-@ year @-@ old customer , a little , poor , black .
i started working on the <unk> , with a <unk> who said , &quot; <unk> so that my 14 @-@ year @-@ old female is actually treated like a 75 @-@ year @-@ old , executive from a corporation . &quot;
in the 1930s , i set out that there had been police behavior in the accusation , in police behavior and in the process .
there was a bold line about how in this country there is no ethics , but a whole lack of ethics .
the next morning , i woke up thinking , would that <unk> be a dream , or really wrote it ?
for my horror , not only had it been <unk> , but he had sent it to court .
it took about two months , i &apos;d already forgotten it .
and i finally decided -- oh , god , i have to go in court for this stupid case .
i got in the car , and i felt really overwhelmed , overwhelmed .
i went in the car to the court .
i thought this would be very difficult and scary .
i finally got off the car . i was walking to the court .
i was going up the stairs when i encountered a big black man , and it was the court of the court .
when he saw me , he approached me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; are you a lawyer ? &quot; i said yes .
so i get tired and bored .
and i was drowning in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m proud of you . &quot;
i have to tell you now that was rude .
that connected deeply with my inner identity , with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope .
well , i went into the audience hall .
as he walked in , the judge saw me .
and he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you write this <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; mr. i was me . &quot; and we started discussing .
people started coming . they were all <unk> .
i was the one who had written those crazy things .
the police came , the <unk> , the <unk> .
suddenly , not knowing how , the room was full of people , because we were talking about races , because we were talking about poverty , because we were talking about inequality .
with the <unk> of my eye , i saw the <unk> going and coming .
i was looking out the window , and i was forced to hear all that <unk> .
he was still walking over here and over there .
finally , this old black man , with his face of concern , came into the room and sat behind me , almost at the table of lawyers .
about 10 minutes later , the judge was <unk> .
during the break , an assistant at the <unk> has been shown because the <unk> had gone into the room .
the assistant complained about the old black .
and he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the audience ? &quot;
and the old black man stood up , looked at the assistant , looked at me and said , &quot; i walked into this audience hall to tell this young man to keep his sight in the aim of stand . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted today , because i think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big , but it folds into justice .
we cannot be truly human beings if we don &apos;t care about human rights and for dignity .
our survival is tied up with others .
that our visions of technology , design , entertainment and creativity should be responsible for <unk> and justice .
and above all , those of you in this room who share this , i just want to tell you that you keep your eyes on the side .
thank you very much .
you &apos;ve just heard and see an obvious desire from the audience , from this community , to help in your purposes , to do something .
something that &apos;s not a check . what can we do ?
there are several near opportunities .
if you live in the state of california , for example , there will be a spring in which there will be an effort to ensure the funds that we spend today in blame policies .
for example , here in california , a billion dollars is going to spend on death row , in the next five years . billion dollars .
and despite this , 46 percent of the cases of <unk> in jail .
eighty @-@ six percent of rapes come nowhere .
here &apos;s a change opportunity .
this little guy is going to propose that he &apos;s going to pay off these funds to make the law be safe .
i think there &apos;s a very close opportunity .
there &apos;s been a huge spike in crime in the united states , in the last three decades .
part of the explanation is that it has to do with the greatest <unk> rate .
what would you say to those who believe it is ?
actually , the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable .
the big mass growth in this country is not for crimes of violence .
it &apos;s the wrong war with drugs .
that &apos;s why this dramatic increase in population rise .
and we were told by the rhetoric of the punishment .
we have three legal causes to bring people to life imprisonment ; for stealing a bicycle , for small crimes of property , instead of getting them to hate those resources to their victims .
i think we have to do more to help victims of <unk> and not less .
i think our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone .
i think that &apos;s the guidance that has to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve been excited today .
you &apos;re so inspiring .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
<unk> : they grow the threats of bin laden &apos;s death .
<unk> : <unk> in somalia . the police issued gas .
<unk> : <unk> posters .
<unk> : social <unk> .
<unk> : mind @-@ blowing <unk> .
several <unk> : war for drug destruction . mass destruction .
recession . it takes over . end , egypt . syria .
crisis : death . disaster .
oh , my god !
these are just some of the clips i got in the last six months -- you might be just the last six days or the last six years .
the idea is that press media prefer negative news because our minds pay attention .
and that answers to a very good reason .
in every second of each day , our senses receive many more data than probably the brain can process .
and as nothing matters more than surviving , the first stop of all of that data is an old segment of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
the amygdala is our early warning detector , the danger detector .
it records and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could hurt us .
so , from a <unk> of stories , we looked at negative stories .
that old adage in the press , &quot; if there &apos;s blood , &quot; it &apos;s very true .
and because all digital devices provide us with negative news for the seven days of the week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not surprising that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not surprising that people think the world is going to make worse .
but maybe not .
maybe , instead , what happens is we get <unk> .
perhaps the huge progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades .
i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our good problems : climate change , species extinction , water scarcity and energy ; we certainly have them .
as human beings , we are very good at solving the problems and , in the long run , we just have them .
so let &apos;s look at what &apos;s happened in the last century to see where we &apos;re going .
in the last hundred years , the average of life has been more than doubled , the average per capita income for inflation has tripled throughout the world .
child mortality has reduced 10 times .
also , the cost of food , electricity , transportation and communications , has fallen 10 to 1,000 times .
steve pinker showed us that we are living the most peaceful times in human history .
and charles applaud that global literacy has gone from 25 to over 80 percent in the last 130 years .
we &apos;re actually living an extraordinary time .
a lot of people forget it .
and we continue to attract higher expectations .
in fact , we <unk> the meaning of poverty .
think about it , today in america , a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity , water , <unk> , tv , cell air conditioning and cars .
the <unk> <unk> of the last century , the <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of such luxury .
supporting a lot of this is technology and , lately , its exponential growth .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve , moore &apos;s law , and double the price performance over 12 to 24 months .
so , the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a 70 @-@ year @-@ old supercomputer .
now look at this curve .
it &apos;s moore &apos;s law over the last hundred years .
i want you to look at two things on this curve .
first , the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times , in war and in peace , in a recession , in depression and booming .
it &apos;s the end of fast computers that we use to build faster computers .
it doesn &apos;t stop at all of the big challenges .
and even though he &apos;s stuck in a law on the left , the curve goes up .
the growth rate of technology is actually getting faster and faster .
and on this curve , moore &apos;s law , there &apos;s a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today .
the computation in the cloud , which my friends from autodesk call infinite computation , sensors and networks , robotics , 3d printing and its ability to democratize and distributed personalized production throughout the planet , synthetic biology , fuels and food , digital medicine , digital medicine , <unk> and artificial medicine .
i mean , how many of you saw the victory in &quot; jeopardy , &quot; from ibm ?
it was epic .
i looked in the newspapers , the best headline i would have .
and i love this one : &quot; watson <unk> to human competitors . &quot;
&quot; jeopardy is not an easy game .
play with the nuances of human language .
imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud , available for everyone in the cell .
four years ago , here at ted , ray kurzweil and i , launched a new university called <unk> university .
we teach these technologies to our students , and , in particular , how they can be used to solving the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we have them release a company , or a service , that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade .
think about that , the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people .
30 years ago , that would have been absurd .
today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done that .
when i think about creating abundance , it doesn &apos;t mean creating life for every single planet -- it &apos;s about creating a life of the possible .
it &apos;s about taking that which is scarce and making it plentiful .
you see , scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
it &apos;s a story of napoleon in the mid @-@ 1800s .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited for dinner the king of <unk> .
the troops ate napoleon with silver , and the same napoleon , with gold <unk> .
but the king of <unk> , ate covered in aluminum .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet ; it was worth more than gold and platinum .
that &apos;s why the tip of the washington rescue is aluminum .
you see , even though aluminum is <unk> percent of the mass of the earth , it doesn &apos;t come as pure metal .
it &apos;s tied up with oxygen and <unk> .
but then the <unk> came in and made it out of aluminum something as cheap as we use it as if it were <unk> .
it <unk> this analogy towards the future .
let &apos;s think of energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re on a planet , bathed in 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
they come to earth 16 <unk> of energy every single minute .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , it &apos;s about access .
and there &apos;s good news .
this year , for the first time , the cost of solar energy in india is 50 percent less than the fuel @-@ generated ; <unk> versus 17 .
the cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year .
last month , the mit published a study that shows that at the end of the decade , at the <unk> parts of the united states , solar electricity will cost six cents an hour with 15 cents of the national average .
and if we have plenty of energy , we also have plenty of water .
let &apos;s talk about the wars over the water .
remember when carl sagan pointed the voyager spacecraft to the earth in 1990 , after saturn ?
he got a famous picture . what was he called ?
&quot; a pale blue dot . &quot;
because we live on a water planet .
we live on a planet covered 70 percent by water .
yes , <unk> percent is salt water , two percent is ice , and we fight for half percent of the water on the planet , but here &apos;s also a hope .
it &apos;s an available technology not in 10 or 20 years , but right now .
nanotechnology comes with <unk> .
in a conversation with dean kamen this morning , one of the innovators in the <unk> -- i &apos;d like to share with you , he gave me permission to do this -- his technology called <unk> -- is already the size of a small refrigerator .
it &apos;s able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water a day of any salt source , contaminated water , a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon .
the ceo of coke has just recently proven that it will do an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world .
if that comes well , and i have a full confidence that it will be , coca @-@ cola will solve it globally , countries on the planet .
this is a <unk> innovation by this technology that exists today .
and we &apos;ve seen it in mobile phones .
my god , we &apos;re going to get 70 percent of the drivers of mobile in the developing world in 2013 .
think about it , that ephemeral warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of kenya than president reagan 25 years ago .
and , having a smartphone with google , it has access to more knowledge and information that president clinton 15 years ago .
he lives in a world of abundance of information and communication that no one could ever have predicted .
better than that , the things that you and i have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece -- <unk> video , hearing images , libraries of books and music , diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones .
maybe the best comes when the health care applications come .
last month , i had the pleasure of <unk> with the <unk> foundation -- something called the <unk> x prize , 10 million dollars .
we &apos;re challenging the equipment in the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk to , and because it has ai , you can get blood out of your finger .
to win , he has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team .
imagine this device in the developing world in which there are no doctors , where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent , and there are 1.3 percent of health care workers .
when this device <unk> a rna or dna virus that doesn &apos;t recognize , it will call the fda of health , and , in the first place , it will make the pandemic happen .
but this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance .
i call it the billion increase .
the white lines here are the population .
we just passed the seven billion mark .
by the way , the best protection against the population explosion is to give the world of education and health .
in 2010 , we had less than two billion people online , connected .
by 2020 , it will happen from two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion minds never before add up to the global conversation .
what do these people want ?
what a hell ? what wishes you have ?
and instead of economic collapse , we have the greatest economic injection of history .
these people represent tens of billions of dollars living in the global economy .
and most health care <unk> thanks to the <unk> , from a better education with the khan and because of the use of 3d impressions and cloud computation will be more productive than ever before .
what can we provide 3,000 million more members of humanity , healthy , productive ?
how about voices never before ?
what if we give them to the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time ?
what are these three billion ?
what if they &apos;re contributions we can &apos;t predict ?
one thing i learned with the x prize is that small teams , oriented by their passion with a clear goal , they can do extraordinary things ; things that they could only do before big companies and corporations .
i &apos;m going to end by sharing a story that really got me excited .
there &apos;s a program that maybe some of you know .
it &apos;s called foldit .
he came up at the university of washington , in seattle .
it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein actually behaves .
the folds determine the structure and the functionality .
it &apos;s very important in medical research .
and , until now , it was a problem of supercomputers .
they &apos;ve played with this college teachers , among others .
then hundreds of thousands of people got angry and started playing it .
and it &apos;s been shown today that the human pattern recognition machinery is better protein than the best computers .
and these people looked for the best protein <unk> in the world , and i didn &apos;t teach at mit , i didn &apos;t learn at caltech ; it was a person in england , in manchester , a woman who , during the day , was a ceo assistant at a rehabilitation clinic and , at night , was the best protein <unk> in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous confidence in the future is that today we have more power as people to take the grand challenges of the planet .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
we have the passion of innovative <unk> .
we have <unk> capital .
and we have 3,000 million new minds that are focused on the solution of big challenges and doing what we should do .
we have for quite extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change .
and i think this starts with a doctor , and that &apos;s me .
and i &apos;ve spent enough time on my fake prestige about that .
before i try the theme of my talk , let &apos;s talk a little bit about baseball .
why not ?
we &apos;re near the end , the world series begins .
we love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of amazing statistics .
there are hundreds of statistics .
it &apos;s about to go out , &quot; <unk> the rules , &quot; speaks about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team .
i &apos;m focusing on one of them , and i hope many of you will know it .
it &apos;s called the <unk> average .
and we talk about 300 , of a switch that is 300 .
that means that the cheap <unk> , three out of 10 times .
that means throwing the ball into the playing field without being caught , and anyone who tries to throw it out at the first base , doesn &apos;t get there in time , and the second base will be thrown out .
three attempts at 10 .
do you know how they call a 300 @-@ light switch in the great plains ?
well , really good , maybe of the team of stars .
you know how they call a 400 @-@ year @-@ old baseball switch ?
by the way , that &apos;s someone who , 10 taps , gets four .
legendary -- like the great ted williams , the last players at the democratic league of <unk> to perform more 400 strikes in a regularly .
now i &apos;m going to challenge this to my medicine world , where i feel much more comfortable , or maybe less uncomfortable , after what i &apos;m going to tell you today .
suppose you have <unk> and you &apos;re derivatives of a surgeon who also has a 400 @-@ year record in <unk> .
that doesn &apos;t work , right ?
now suppose you live in a remote place and a loved one has two coronary arteries <unk> and your family &apos;s guide to a cardiologist whose record on <unk> is 200 .
but , you know something ?
she &apos;s dramatically improving this year .
and their farms have been <unk> .
this is not working .
but i &apos;m telling you .
what do you think it should be the average of a cardiac surgeon or orthopedic surgeon , of a nurse or a thousand , very well .
and the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the <unk> of a good surgeon , a doctor or a <unk> .
what we do , though , is we serve the world , and i include myself , with the mandate to be perfect .
that never , ever , would make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well .
that was the message that i was attending when i was in medical college .
i was a obsessive student .
once , a fellow in high school said that brian goldman sachs to a blood test .
such .
i studied in my little <unk> , in the chief nurses at the general university of toronto , not far from here .
and i learned everything from memory .
from my kind of anatomy , i <unk> the origin and the work of muscle , the spin of every artery that comes out of the aorta , the unconscious diagnosis and the usual .
and i even knew the difference in how to classify the kidney <unk> .
and as long as we gather more and more knowledge .
and i went very well ; i graduated with <unk> .
and getting rid of the medical school with the impression that if you knew everything , then it would know everything , or as close as possible , as soon as possible , because that &apos;s how i get tired of mistakes .
and it worked for a while , until i met the madame <unk> lady .
i was a resident at a university hospital here , in toronto , when they brought the lady to the emergency service where i was working .
at the time , i was welcomed in cardiology .
and when i &apos;m applying delivery to an f.
and it inform the boss of residents .
when i saw the madame <unk> , i was <unk> .
i heard a ringing sound .
and when i rescued it , i heard a sound <unk> on both sides , which indicate to me heart failure .
in these conditions the heart stopped working , and instead of pump the blood forward , the blood goes into the lungs , they fill in the blood , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s difficult to breathe .
and it wasn &apos;t hard to diagnose .
i did , and i started working on the treatment i would give .
i gave him aspirin and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart .
i gave her <unk> , water pills , so she could remove liquid .
and in an hour or two , she started feeling better .
and i felt really good .
and that &apos;s when i made the first mistake , i sent her home .
i actually made two more mistakes .
i sent her home without talking to her boss .
i didn &apos;t get up the phone , i didn &apos;t do what i should have done , which was to call my boss , and i had dinner with him so he saw it .
and if my boss had seen it , it would have been able to deal with safe information .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be a conductor who was holding constant attention .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility , that i could take care of my patients without even reaching my boss .
the second mistake i made was worse .
when he sends his house , he didn &apos;t pay attention to a voice in my inner voice saying , &quot; goldman sachs , that &apos;s not a good idea . don &apos;t do it . &quot;
in fact , i was so insecure that i even asked the nurse who was taking care of the lady , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay if you &apos;re going to your house ? &quot;
and the nurse thought , and then she said , &quot; yes , i think it &apos;s okay . &quot;
i remember that as it was yesterday .
so , i signed the high , and the ambulance next to the ambulance <unk> her home .
and i went back to the hospital room .
the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had a bad <unk> in the stomach .
but i went on with my job .
at the end of the day , i negotiated to leave the hospital and i walked into the parking space where my car was to go home . i did something i don &apos;t normally do .
i went through the service of running home .
and there &apos;s another nurse , not the girl who was taking care of the lady before , but another . she told me three words , those three words that most emergency physicians fear .
other specialists who might fear them too , but there &apos;s a <unk> in <unk> , and we see patients talking .
the three words are : does it remember you ?
&quot; does it remember the patient who sent home ? &quot;
he asked the other full nurse .
&quot; well she went back , &quot; with the same voice tone .
she was fine .
but he went back and on the verge of death .
after an hour of having arrived at his house , after i gave him high , he suffered a collapse and his family called 911 , and the ambulance brought him into a high blood pressure , which means severe shock .
i was barely breathing , and i was blue .
emergency staff will save all their resources .
they gave her medication to raise her blood pressure .
and they put an artificial <unk> .
i was injured and <unk> to the marrow .
he had a mixture of feelings , because after he got it , he was in intense therapies and he hoped against all the hope he would get tired .
and in the two or three days , it was obvious that they never cooked .
he had permanent brain damage .
the family gathered together .
and in eight or nine days , they were joining what was happening .
and on the ninth day , they let her go . the madame <unk> woman , wife and grandmother .
they say they never forget the names of those who die .
that was my first experience .
the next few weeks , i was amazed at that and i experienced for the first time the embarrassment of shame that exists in our medical culture and i felt lonely , isolated , not feeling that healthy embarrassment because you can &apos;t relate to your peers .
you know , you know that health state when you ask the best friend to write a secret that he promised to save , and he finds out . so his friend faces , and you have a terrible discussion , but in the end , that disgusting feeling is his <unk> and you can admit that he never <unk> that error .
you make peace and you never make that mistake .
it &apos;s that shame that leaves a teaching .
the shame of what i &apos;m talking about is what makes us feel very bad inside .
it &apos;s the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong , but we &apos;re bad .
and that felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for my boss ; he was a <unk> .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure he <unk> things and made sure he didn &apos;t shave me .
and i kept getting those questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask my boss ? why did i send her home ?
and in my worst moments , why did i make such a dumb error ?
why did i choose medicine ?
slowly , that feeling was <unk> .
and i started feeling better .
and on a rainy day , the sky opened and finally the sun came out , and i wondered if i &apos;d feel better again .
and i did a deal with myself in which if i simplify the efforts to be perfect in order not to make more mistakes , i would cheat those voices .
and that &apos;s how it went .
i went back to work .
but it again happens .
two years later , i was an assistant at the emergency department in a community hospital in northern toronto , and i got a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man with a pain in his throat .
i was very busy .
and he <unk> here .
i looked at his throat , he was kind of hot .
he <unk> penicillin and i sent him home .
but while he was at the door , he was still pointing his throat .
two days later , when i came to make my police change , my boss asked me to talk to me on his office .
and he made the three words : does it remember you ?
do you recall the patient who saw from a pain in her throat ?
so he went back and he didn &apos;t have a <unk> .
he had a potentially fatal condition called <unk> .
you can search for google . it &apos;s an infection , not the throat , but from the upper air , and it can cause the closing of those pathways .
he , fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he <unk> antibiotics down the road , and he recovered at the few days .
and i stepped back from the same period of shame and <unk> , then moved back and returned to work , until it happened again and again , and again .
twice in the same emergency shift , we don &apos;t have any <unk> .
and it &apos;s a great effort , especially working in a hospital , because it &apos;s 14 patients at the same time .
but in both cases , i haven &apos;t sent them home , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s been a <unk> .
one of them thought i had kidney calculus .
he downloaded an x @-@ ray of kidneys , but it turned out to be normal -- a colleague that was looking at the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the lower right quadrant and called the surgeon .
the other patient was with a lot of diarrhea .
i <unk> her liquid for <unk> , and i asked my colleague to write it .
he checked , and he noticed some sensitivity in the lower right quadrant , called the surgeon .
both of these were operated and they recovered well .
but every case i get tired , i get scared .
but i would like to tell you that i made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise , and as many colleagues say , it &apos;s a mess .
the most significant have been over the last five years .
only , ashamed and no support .
and here &apos;s the problem : if i can &apos;t afford it and talk about my mistakes , if i can &apos;t find the <unk> that tells me what really happens , how can i share this with my colleagues ?
how do i teach them this so that they don &apos;t make mistakes themselves ?
if i now entered a place like this , i would have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failing , after failure , after failure ?
of course , at a party , you &apos;ll hear about other medical errors , but you won &apos;t hear somebody talk about their own mistakes .
if i now entered a room full of colleagues , if i asked them for support and telling them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would not have to go to the second story without before they started <unk> , someone would make a joke , they would change the topic and they would follow .
and if i knew and my colleagues too , that a <unk> in my hospital would shake the wrong leg , believe i would have difficulties in the eyes .
this is the system we have .
complete denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s the system in which there are two positions : those who make mistakes and those who cannot sleep and those who do ; those who have lousy results and those who have great results .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like antibodies that starts to attack that person .
we have the idea that if you stop the drug from people who make mistakes , you will stay safe system .
but that brings two problems .
in 20 years , approximately as a spread and medical journalism , i have done a study of health care and medical errors to learn what &apos;s possible , from the first article i wrote for the star toronto , &quot; white horse <unk> , art . &quot;
and what i learned is that mistakes are ubiquitous .
we work in a system where mistakes happen every single day , where one out of 10 drugs locked up in the hospital is wrong , or <unk> is not right . in a system where hiv infections are increasingly , and more numerous , causing chaos and death .
in this country , 24 / 7 dying of <unk> medical errors .
the u.s. medical institute set out 100,000 .
in both cases , it &apos;s <unk> <unk> , because we &apos;re not <unk> the problem as we should .
and so there are things .
a forgotten system where knowledge exploded every two or three years , and we wouldn &apos;t be distracted .
sleep deprivation fills the whole thing .
and we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have cognitive biases that allow for a perfect history of a patient with chest pain .
now , let &apos;s take the same patient with a pain in the chest , comes with <unk> eyes and with breath for alcohol and , all of a sudden , my story is <unk> .
it &apos;s not the same story .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t do things always .
and my patients are not cars . they don &apos;t always have their symptoms in the same way .
all over this , mistakes are inevitable .
so if we take the system as we were taught , and we removed all the professionals who are going to be wrong , well , no one will stay .
and with respect that people don &apos;t want to talk about their most serious cases ?
in my program : &quot; black <unk> , black art , &quot; it &apos;s a custom to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake . &quot; i would tell all of you from the <unk> to the head of cardiac surgery : &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah -- what are your mistakes ? &quot; and get the microphone into them .
and his students would be visibly , his students would bend his head and <unk> saliva and start telling his stories .
they want to tell their stories , they want to share them .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake . &quot;
they need a context where they can do it .
they need a medical culture .
and he starts with a doctor every time .
so cyber doctor is human ; you know human ; you accept it , and you don &apos;t seem to be proud of their mistakes , but you try to learn what &apos;s happened to teach others .
they share their experiences with them .
it &apos;s support for those who talk about their mistakes .
it points out the errors of other people , not with the intent of abuse , but in a way of loving and support so that everyone is joining .
and he works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings are running the system , and when this happens , they make mistakes rather than when .
but the system is evolving to create <unk> that will allow those very simple mistakes that we inevitably make humans , and also promote the support and the love , the spaces from where you look at the health care system , you can find potential errors and be rewarded by that , particularly people like me , so that we make errors for <unk> .
my name is brian goldman sachs .
i &apos;m a christian doctor .
i &apos;m human ; i make mistakes .
and i feel so much , but i &apos;m strive to learn something that can transmit others .
i don &apos;t know what they think about me yet , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three personal words : i remember it .
i &apos;m going to talk about a very small idea .
the <unk> of the starting point .
and as the idea can be explained in a minute , before i &apos;ll give you three examples to make time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
he was here , as you know , in <unk> .
you probably think it &apos;s <unk> , but it wasn &apos;t .
he actually would pick fish .
and he described one of them as very common .
it was just the mere .
they were sweating a lot to the 1880s .
now , the fish is in the red <unk> canyon .
but we &apos;ve heard this story many times , about galapagos and elsewhere , so that has nothing special .
but the case is we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re <unk> .
the <unk> still say it &apos;s intact .
so what &apos;s going on here ?
second story , also illustrates another concept : the shifting of the waist .
because i was there in 1971 studying a fresh lagoon in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe , and then i wanted to work in africa .
i thought i could give it up .
i was very pleased with the sun , and i was convinced that i wasn &apos;t there .
this is my first exhibition on the sun .
the lagoon was surrounded by <unk> , and , as you can see , of a mangroves .
there were about 20 inches , black beard <unk> .
and the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and it was for a good time , so it would win more than half in ghana .
when i was there 27 years later , the number of fish had declined half .
he went to five inches .
they experimented with genetic pressure .
there were still fish .
in a way , they were still happy .
and the fish were still happy to be there .
i mean , nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third story is that i was partner in the introduction of <unk> fishing in southeast asia .
in the 1970s , well , it started in europe &apos;s <unk> and did a lot of development projects .
development set out to impose the countries that already had 100,000 fishermen , preserving the industrial fisheries .
and this boat , pretty ugly , called the four <unk> .
i went out fishing in him , and we did studies in the south of the south china sea and , above all , in the java sea .
what we captured there was something <unk> .
we capture , now i know , sea bottom .
ninety percent of what we capture were , other animals that are in the background .
and most of the fish are tiny blobs of these tar @-@ like things , remains that are coral reefs .
in short , the bottom of the sea came on the deck and then it was <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
in one year , you do a studio , and then you start commercial fishing .
the background is going to be a solid coral deep , soft coral , in this case , to be a <unk> .
this is a dead turtle .
they didn &apos;t eat them . they didn &apos;t eat them because they were dead .
we once captured a life .
i was still not pregnant .
so they wanted to eat it because it was a good food .
this mountain of remains is what fishermen collect every time they go to a zone where they never have fish .
but it &apos;s not yet documented .
we turn the world , but we don &apos;t remember .
let &apos;s start the starting point , at the new level , without remembering what was there .
if you look at this , something like this .
on the y @-@ axis , we have good things : biodiversity , the number of killer whales , the <unk> of the country , the water supply .
and that changes with time . it changes because people do things with sadness .
every generation is trying to collect images from the beginning of their conscious life as normal and empowered them forward .
the difference is that they experience loss .
but they don &apos;t perceive the loss that happened before .
you can analyze the set of changes .
and at the end , it &apos;s miserable in the end .
and that , largely , is what we want to do now .
we want to keep things that are no longer , or they &apos;re not what they were .
but one should think that this problem is affecting people when post @-@ colonial societies kill animals without knowing what they &apos;ve done to a few generations later .
because , obviously , an animal that &apos;s very abundant , before it &apos;s extinct , is unusual .
you don &apos;t lose stuffed animals .
you lose small animals .
even if this doesn &apos;t feel like a big loss .
over time , we focus on big animals , and a sea synonymous with big fish .
they become unusual because the <unk> .
over time , we have a few fish , but we think that &apos;s the starting point .
and the question is , why do we accept this ?
well , because we don &apos;t know it was different .
in fact , a lot of people , scientists , suggest that it was very different .
and they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way is not in the way that they would expect evidence to be .
for example , the anecdote that some of you have , as just as a captain and just looked at a lot of fish in this area can &apos;t be used or , generally , they don &apos;t use fishing scientists , because it &apos;s not science .
so , we have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in civilized societies , because they don &apos;t rely on the sources of the past .
from there the enormous paper that can deliver a protected ocean area .
because with marine protected areas , we actually re @-@ create the past .
we &apos;re creating the past that people can &apos;t conceive of because the starting point has gone down and is extremely low .
that &apos;s for the people who can see a protected ocean zone and can benefit from vision that provides , which allows them to delete their starting point .
and what about the people who can &apos;t do it because they have no access , like the middle eastern people , for example ?
i think the arts and film can probably fill the void . the simulation .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were gray whales in chesapeake bay , 500 years ago .
and you may have noticed that the nuances and the <unk> are like &quot; avatar &quot; .
and if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were excited with the film -- let &apos;s talk about the story of <unk> , why do you paint with images ?
because it raises something that , in a sense , has lost .
so my suggestion , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is cameron , avatar , &quot; under the water .
thank you very much .
in the &apos; 80s , in the eastern communist germany , if you had a typewriter machine , you had to write against the government .
you had to register a piece of text for example written with the machine .
and this so that the government could track the origin of the texts .
if they found a written with the wrong message , they could track the footprint to the origin of the idea .
in the west , we don &apos;t think that someone could do this , how much this would undermine freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our countries .
but today , in 2011 , if you buy a laser printer of any big manufacturer and prints a page , that page will end up having some yellow dots on every page that follow a pattern that makes them one and its own printer .
that &apos;s happening today .
and nobody seems a lot about this .
this is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us , citizens .
and it &apos;s one of the three main causes of problems in the network .
if we look at what happens in the online world , we can set up the attacks according to their attackers .
there are three major groups .
there are <unk> .
like mr. <unk> &apos;s city of <unk> , in ukraine .
the <unk> cell is very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use cyber weapons to make a lot of money , enormous amounts .
there are actually many cases of million @-@ dollar units , <unk> money with their attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> , of estonia , estonia .
this is alfred <unk> .
this is stephen watt .
this is <unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> al @-@ <unk> and so on and so forth .
these guys are doing their online <unk> , but they &apos;re doing it for illegal means using <unk> banks to steal money from our bills when we buy online , or steal our key to get information from our boards when we buy an infected computer .
the secret service of america , two months ago , <unk> the swiss account of this man , sam jain , and this bill had <unk> millions of dollars when it was frozen .
mr. jain <unk> : his <unk> is known .
and i say today , it &apos;s more likely than any of us to be a victim of a real crime than a real crime .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this goes from bad to worse .
in the future , most crimes are online .
the second group of attackers in importance that we observe today is not motivated by the money .
there &apos;s another thing that moves them , they motivate the protests , they motivate their opinions , they motivate them all the laughter .
groups like <unk> have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a leading role in online attacks .
those are the three leading attackers : the criminal who do it for money , the <unk> as <unk> , who do it for <unk> , and the last group is national states that attack .
and then we see cases like <unk> .
that &apos;s a good example of government attack against its own citizens .
<unk> is an authority of the netherlands , or indeed , it was .
he declared the last fall because of a <unk> .
it <unk> the safety of the site and it <unk> a <unk> .
last week , i asked , in a meeting with dutch government representatives , i asked one of the leaders if they asked the death of people because of the attack <unk> .
and the answer of him was yes .
so , how does people die of a attack of these ?
<unk> is an illegitimate authority .
they sell certified .
what do the certificate for ?
well , you need , if you have a website with <unk> , services like <unk> , services like gmail .
now all of us , or almost all of us , use the gmail or some of their competitors , but these services are very popular in <unk> states like iran where dissidents by using foreign services like because they know that they are more reliable than local services and are <unk> in connections so that the local government can &apos;t deal with their discussions .
unless we give a foreign authority .
and he <unk> the <unk> .
and in the case of <unk> , that exactly happened .
and what happened in the arab spring and those things that have happened , for example , in egypt ?
well , in egypt , the protesters -- the headquarters for the egyptian police in april 2011 , and during the <unk> of the building , they found a lot of papers .
amongst those papers was this folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and within that folder , there were notes of a company based on germany that had sold the egyptian government tools to intercept the great scale of the communications of the citizens of the country .
he had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the egyptian government .
the company headquarters are right here .
so , western governments provide tools for governments to train them so they can do this to their citizens .
but western governments also do this themselves .
for example , in germany , just a couple of weeks ago , the <unk> was found -- a <unk> used by german government officials to investigate their own citizens .
if you &apos;re suspicious in a good criminal case , it &apos;s quite obvious that your phone is <unk> .
but today it goes further .
the internet connection is <unk> .
they use even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication , and listen to online arguments , to get our data .
when we think about things like this , the obvious answer should be , &quot; well , it sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t really affect me because i &apos;m an honest citizen .
why worry ?
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
it &apos;s in the game of privacy .
privacy is not in dispute .
it &apos;s not a question of privacy versus safety .
it &apos;s about freedom versus control .
if we could well be able to rely on our governments today in 2011 , any rights we want to use today will forever .
in any future government , in an administration that we could have within 50 years ?
these are the questions that we care about in the next 50 years .
this may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big <unk> of the concrete block .
the first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea : concrete modules of a fixed measurement that fit together .
very quickly , these became the most used construction unit in the world .
they &apos;ve allowed us to build bigger things than us , like buildings or bridges , a brick at a time .
essentially , these blocks have become the building blocks of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , to <unk> , this happened .
he was called an automatic assembly .
and in a few years , the <unk> bricks arrived at all the homes .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges , buildings or homes .
lego made it accessible .
lego just embraced the concrete block , the favorite in the world , and made it a fundamental piece of our imagination .
meanwhile , exactly that year , in bell labs , the next revolution was about to point out : the new building block .
the transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us out of a climbing world and a few others into a world where everything was interactive .
just like the concrete block , the transistor allows us to create much greater and more complex , a brick at once .
but there &apos;s a major difference : the transistor was just for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts , so i decided to change it .
eight years ago , when i was at the media lab , i started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
i &apos;m going to show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function .
they are empowered to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
and the best part of it is that they link together by magnets .
so you can &apos;t get them wrong .
the bricks have a code of colors .
the green is the output , the blue is the stream , the pink is the input and the orange one is the wire .
so you only have to assemble a blue with a green one , and very quickly you can start to make major circuits .
a blue with a green light makes light .
we can put a button in the middle , and so we &apos;ve got a regulator .
if we change the button for a pulse module , which is here , and now we have a light bulb .
we add this <unk> to create more impact , and we have a noise machine .
i &apos;m going to stop this .
so beyond the simple game , <unk> are actually very powerful .
instead of having to program , connect and link , enabling us to program using very simple intuitive gestures .
to make your blink faster or slower , you simply turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing collection .
we want all the interactions in the world to be distributed to bricks ready to use .
lights , sounds , solar panels , motors ; everything must be accessible .
we &apos;ve given kids to watch them play with them .
and it &apos;s been an amazing experience .
the best part is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don &apos;t learn in schools .
for example , how does a light at night , or why an elevator &apos;s door is kept open , or how an ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also taken the design schools .
so , for example , designers without any experience in electronics begin playing games like a material .
here you can see , with paper bottles and <unk> , we have <unk> , creating ...
a few weeks ago , we took <unk> to the designers of the rhode island school of design , which have no experience in engineering , <unk> in cardboard , wood and <unk> and said , &quot; do something . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they &apos;ve done , a cannon by motion .
but wait , here comes my favorite project .
it &apos;s a locust made of play @-@ dough that is afraid of the dark .
for these non @-@ engineers , <unk> became another material , electronics became another material .
and we want this material to be at the reach of everyone .
so , <unk> has open source .
you can visit the website , download all the design files and throw it away .
we want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators , because this world we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so go ahead and invent .
thank you .
