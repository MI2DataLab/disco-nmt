ross , hug rachel .
can i buy a bubble machine when i move in ?

yeah , speaking of sweet moves , he wants something extra special .
you want to tell him he &apos;s moving out ? i tried .
all i can say is , &quot; joey , i have to .. &quot;
and then i lost the nerve to say , &quot; go to the bathroom . &quot;
he probably thinks i &apos;m sick .
i really have to tell rachel .
we are so <unk> .
next time you see them , tell them .
that &apos;s the decision .
so this is it now ? you &apos;re gonna make me do this , right ?
pretty much .
okay .
monica .
any better ?
joey , we need to tell you something .
oh , my god . you &apos;re pregnant .

joey , here &apos;s the thing .
monica and i decided to live together , so i &apos;ll move out .
good for you . congratulations . bye .
you okay ?
i gotta go . this is gonna work .
looks like you &apos;re the only one who believes it .
damn it .
i &apos;m just moving across the hall . i promise .
as long as monica and i split up , we move back in .
now ?
if you &apos;re gonna live with him , i feel responsible for telling you who he is .
he &apos;s a terrible roommate .
he &apos;ll forget ... always ...
who am i kidding ? he &apos;s the best .
phoebe
there &apos;s an article about two married and not telling each other .
really ?
yeah , i &apos;m watching ross geller magazines .
have you seen rachel ?
no . what ?
i have good news .
you &apos;re pregnant .
no , chandler and i decided to move in together . great .
but if you have a baby , what &apos;s your name , phoebe ?
what ?
chandler and i are gonna live together .
oh , my god . my sister and my best friend ... hooked up .
great .
hey , i &apos;m glad , too . come on .
it &apos;s a busy day . someone &apos;s moving in . someone &apos;s gonna cancel .
i &apos;m gonna go pick up rachel , but ..
wouldn &apos;t it be so bad to see her ?
the bad news to rachel ...
what &apos;s her bad news ?
can we stop talking ?
my life is embarrassing . i should live under someone else &apos;s stairs .
it &apos;s not that bad .
you got married three times , you got a personal life and a date ..
no , i &apos;m not . my dates are down to rock bottom .
more than four divorces and murderers ...
<unk> .
ross , don &apos;t be silly . you &apos;re cute and smart .
this is more important than three divorces .
really ? you &apos;ve been married three times ?
it &apos;s not fair . it &apos;s usually 60 years old .
how young are you ?
yeah , i &apos;m young .
maybe .
you &apos;re the only one who cares about embarrassing things in your head .
i &apos;ll prove it .
come here .
what ?
my friend ross is getting a divorce , but you &apos;re not going out with him ?
i &apos;ll go get ross .
i thought you were rachel . where have i been ?
i have to tell her .
i already told ross and phoebe it was just her .
so everyone knows we &apos;re moving in together . we &apos;re sure we can &apos;t change our minds .
you scared ? scared ?
no .
that &apos;s my most scared voice . you &apos;re brave .
this is bad .
you thought you were finally valued , and the boss called you &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the first four years , everyone calls me <unk> .
it &apos;s true .
i believe that .
at the staff meeting . no one &apos;s gonna correct her .
so everyone &apos;s called <unk> .
the guy from the mailroom is <unk> .
i still think you &apos;re fine . you &apos;re beautiful .
what ?
it &apos;s all yours .
sit .
look , chandler and i are staying here together .
oh , my god ! that &apos;s so great !
good for you .
really ?
that &apos;s nice of you to ask me first .
the three of us will be happy together .
yeah .
chandler , you can &apos;t shower this morning . you know , you can &apos;t be late .
he &apos;ll notice .
so exciting .
to knock on my door .
we &apos;re waiting for you .
once we know something , it &apos;s not that bad .
first marriage : wife withholding sexual orientation is not my fault .
second marriage : under oath , a little bit of my fault .
third marriage .
you can &apos;t get married and drink and paint on your face .
what do you think ? who doesn &apos;t want to date him ?
divorce doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;ll date him , but i can &apos;t .
what about you ? you want to , too ?
actually , i &apos;m not going out anymore .
i always see a bad guy for me .
i &apos;ll settle this ... whatever .
meg , what about you ?
i don &apos;t care about the divorce , but i &apos;m not going out with him .
he doesn &apos;t normally shed that much light .
he &apos;s obviously still in love with this rachel thing .
she said , &quot; he obviously still loves this rachel . &quot;
don &apos;t be ridiculous . rachel &apos;s my best friend .
she did love her , but now she &apos;s just my wife .
phoebe , would you mind ?
okay , i thought you loved her when you married her .
when we were drunk , i married joey .
you &apos;ve done worse than joey tribbiani .
i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re wrong . i just don &apos;t want to get married three times .
that &apos;s right . he kept his marriage to her because he loved her .
i gotta say , meg , good job .
okay , if you want to get over the divorce three times .
i &apos;m gonna go get a lawyer to cancel .
because i don &apos;t love her at all .
i can &apos;t date you right now . you look a little psycho .
suddenly i find him attractive .
when are we gonna tell rachel the truth ?
it &apos;s almost too soon . you just couldn &apos;t say it .
i can &apos;t do it . she &apos;s my best friend .
joey &apos;s my best friend .
i &apos;m not your best friend ?
you said yourself ...
of course you &apos;re my best friend .
but would you please tell <unk> ?
well , at least i &apos;m ready .
nice .
it &apos;s not for you . are you upset ?
i do now .
hi , nice room . bye .
rach , i have something important to tell you .
you &apos;re pregnant ?
no , but i &apos;m throwing it away .
thought there was some misunderstanding .
i said chandler and i want to live together .
it means only two people .
oh , my god , that &apos;s funny . i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m wrong .
no , you don &apos;t know . it &apos;s my fault . i &apos;m so sorry .
you can look at the house as soon as you need to .
okay .
okay .
you don &apos;t eat cookies ?
yeah .
thank you . do you need a tissue ?
where &apos;d you get the cookies ?
i did it .
oh , my god . this is delicious .
whose is this ?
mine .
what about this ?
mine , too .
what about the dishwasher ?
when i moved in .
that &apos;s why i thought it would be fun .
it &apos;s weird that you weren &apos;t here when i got home .
no , joey and joey are done . no more <unk> .
&quot; do you want to go to joey and joey ? &quot;
&quot; no , it &apos;s gone . &quot;
i just moved across the hall . i can still be the same .
but not in the middle of the night .
we didn &apos;t do it once .
you don &apos;t remember that night was late . i wasn &apos;t feeling well .
you said i &apos;d be better tomorrow ?
yeah , i remember .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m gonna miss those days with you , too .
what &apos;s that ?
gross .
i told rachel that we were gonna live together , didn &apos;t she ?
great . what a surprise .
no crying or upset .
you &apos;re upset because you didn &apos;t make your best friend cry ?
all i ask is , it &apos;s 6 years &apos; roommate .
what ? rachel and i are not . are you guys ready ?
i mean , aren &apos;t you happy ?
don &apos;t i deserve some tears ?
when we tell <unk> he &apos;s gonna cry , his eyes are coming out .
i &apos;m not crying out my eyes .
come on . it &apos;s like the end of a era , no more <unk> .
i have to ask , who calls us that ?
you &apos;re married again .
yeah .
this is your second wedding in february .
two years . three times .
i &apos;ve been a divorce lawyer for 23 years , and i haven &apos;t felt so alone .
why didn &apos;t you tell me what happened ?
basically , rachel and i were in vegas . we were drunk ..
i &apos;m sorry , rach . that &apos;s the one you called the wrong name ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t love her .
that &apos;s better .
it &apos;s a drunk mistake . i &apos;m gonna cancel . i get it .
have you considered therapy ?
i think we should cancel today .
to fill out some forms .
simple .
there &apos;s got to be a witness that proves you were in trouble .
sure .
and i need you to tell the judge
can &apos;t we not talk to her ? i told her it &apos;s done .
of course you did .
ross , you and rachel are here to cancel the annulment .
what about someone who looks like rachel ?
i &apos;ll consider therapy .
i think it &apos;s time to start splitting something .
okay .
you don &apos;t have to .
you move . we don &apos;t live together .
okay .
rachel , who &apos;s this for ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t think i want too many memories .
what &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know .
what about this ? i want you to keep a big plate .
thank you . i love this dish .
so you can remember me .
it &apos;s not dying . i &apos;m just moving out .
still see each other every day .
but a big change can also say it &apos;s an era .
you okay ? you didn &apos;t blink .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m just thinking about an era .
okay .
but honestly , i don &apos;t think 6 years is a time .
a time is a big day .
it &apos;s important to me . maybe it doesn &apos;t matter to you .
what &apos;s wrong with you ? what &apos;s wrong with you ?
why aren &apos;t you happier ? are you splitting up ?
wouldn &apos;t miss me ?
okay , say it . don &apos;t freak me out .
it &apos;s just a little hard to believe ?
it means you guys . that &apos;s what you guys do , okay ?
you guys said you were getting married in vegas , and then you fell asleep .
i &apos;m not sad because i don &apos;t think you &apos;re really gonna live together .
it &apos;s confirmed . <unk> moved in .
but ...
i know . just hear me out , okay ?
this isn &apos;t the spur of the moment in las vegas . we really want to live together .
that &apos;s it ?
really ? yeah , honey .
so we can &apos;t live together anymore ?
no .
god , i &apos;m gonna miss you . i &apos;m gonna miss you too .
it means it &apos;s an era . i know .
bye .
here we go .
did you get the annulment ? no .
i knew it , because you were so stupid .
it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s more complicated than i thought ...
<unk>
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;ll go tell her right now and get the paperwork done .
would i do that if i loved her ?
i &apos;m more sure you love her right now .
i don &apos;t feel anything , okay ?

monica and chandler are really moving in . i have to move out . everything &apos;s changing .
oh , my god . come here . it &apos;s okay . everything &apos;s gonna be okay .

ross and rachel got married . monica and chandler almost got married .
do you think we &apos;re gonna be together ?
yes , but not now .
really ? when was that ?
okay , first of all , chandler and monica are gonna get married .
but not enough .
wow . i know .
and then i &apos;m gonna marry chandler for money .
you &apos;ll marry a couple beautiful kids . great .
but then we abandoned them and we got married .
we &apos;re gonna have chandler &apos;s estate , rachel &apos;s baby .
custody is good , because rachel has a drinking problem .
what about ross ? i don &apos;t want to say anything , but ..
we fought , and i killed him .

thank you so much for letting me see you .
you &apos;ve been taking care of vito since he died .
i really don &apos;t know who else to call ..
don &apos;t cry . don &apos;t do this .
what can i do for you ?
it &apos;s about little vito .
social worker said he started building houses .
social worker ?
mostly boys .
but he &apos;s angry .
a lot of bad things about him are <unk> .
they said he hung a cat in the car &apos;s bedroom .
but it &apos;s completely <unk> .
but you know what happens when vito dies and all the racist situations .
i think the only way to fix it is to move out .
away from that house and school kids .
i found it .
i know it &apos;s a lot of money .
but only $ 100,000 .
you can move to a place no one knows .
my friend lives in maine .
next to <unk> .
there &apos;s an apartment nearby .
and a good school .
you always say if there &apos;s anything you can do to help .
of course .
did you talk to his uncle ?
who ?
phil !
phil &apos;s not his uncle . he and i are distant cousins .
before we go deeper ,
making little vito and your family
before your friends and family split up ,
i should talk to him first . he can &apos;t communicate .
being a father isn &apos;t easy .
yeah .
but maybe it will .
okay , but you &apos;ll think about it , right ?
trust me , i &apos;ll take care of you . he &apos;ll be fine .
now .
little vito &apos;s obviously a handful .
it &apos;s not weird , because the dirt in the family ?
she wants $ 100,000 to change her scenery .
it &apos;s not working .
she should give him a puppy .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
what happened to gary cooper ?
because i &apos;m the boss of this family ?
where the hell is phil ?
he killed vito , started causing the trouble .
my best earner .
and now i &apos;m being double @-@ crossed .
not to mention he &apos;s his uncle .

because little vito needs a social worker .
<unk> told me some things .

there &apos;s $ 3,000 in here ?
come on .
you &apos;re gonna take it .

i don &apos;t want my interest in you .
no .
i should have given interest .

oh , my god . are we gonna let this go ?
it &apos;s late .
going home .
you have to pee or do what you want .
i loan people money , and suddenly i &apos;m the bad guy .
why would he borrow your money ?
why ? go to <unk> .
no , gambling is a luxury .
and the yacht .

i took a lot of money from a loan shark .

who forgets ? tell him to die .
i don &apos;t like it when you see him before you sleep .
give me some interest . what &apos;s the big deal ?
three weeks .
you &apos;ve been around a lot of jews in business , haven &apos;t you ?
my business ?
yeah .
when it comes to money , you &apos;ll have to hand it over .
according to my experience ,
it &apos;s just an ignorant bias , really ?
i have a friend . you left a krugerrands in <unk> .
he &apos;s on the shore .
like you said he was a friend .
shut up , old friend .
but i can &apos;t stop him from getting in trouble because i owe him money .
i need some cash , a little cash flow .
to the money we &apos;ve been talking about lately .
bet ?
you know the stakes aren &apos;t lost .
why not ?
i &apos;ve never been able to resist .
you keep saying that .
always lose .
you &apos;re gonna pretend to be okay in front of your people .
but if we lose , what &apos;s the point ?
so you &apos;re taking a risk .
what are you after ?
money or pleasure ?
before it &apos;s over .
there &apos;s something i need to talk about .
you missed a lot of appointments .
i &apos;ve always called ahead , or i &apos;ll pay the piper .
