it &apos;s &quot; woman . &quot; i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know what to do . please don &apos;t tell rachel .
rachel is one of my best friends .
but when the only person who knew that made me feel good , okay ?

yeah , speaking of sweet moves , he wants something special .
you wanna tell him he &apos;s moving out ? i haven &apos;t tried .
all i can say is , &quot; joey , i have to ... &quot;
and then i lost my nerve to say , &quot; go to the bathroom . &quot;
he probably thinks i &apos;m sick .
i really have to tell rachel .
we are so <unk> .
next time you see them , tell them .
that &apos;s the decision .
so this is it ? you &apos;re gonna do this to me now , aren &apos;t you ?
pretty much .
okay .
monica ?
any better ?
joey , we need to tell you something .
oh , my god . you &apos;re pregnant .
no .
no ? no .
joey , here &apos;s the thing .
monica and i decided to live together , so i &apos;ll move out .
good for you . congratulations . bye .
are you okay ?
i have to go . this is gonna work .
looks like you &apos;re the only one who believes it .
oh , crap .
i &apos;m just moving across the hall . i promise .
as long as monica and i split up , we move back in .
now ?
if you &apos;re gonna live with him , i feel obligated to tell you what he is .
he &apos;s a terrible roommate .
he &apos;ll forget ... always ...
who am i kidding ? he &apos;s the best .
phoebe ?
there &apos;s an article about two married and not telling each other .
really ?
yeah , i &apos;m watching ross geller magazines .
have you seen rachel ?
no . what ?
i have good news .
you &apos;re pregnant .
no , chandler and i decided to move in together . great .
but if you have a baby , what &apos;s your name , phoebe ?
what ?
chandler and i are gonna live together .
oh , my god . my sister &apos;s with my ... best friend .
great .
hey , i &apos;m glad , too . come on .
it &apos;s a busy day . someone &apos;s moving in . someone &apos;s gonna cancel .
i &apos;m gonna go get some sleep , but ...
wouldn &apos;t it be bad if i met her ?
the bad news for rachel ...
what &apos;s her bad news ?
can we stop talking ?
i &apos;m embarrassed . i should live under someone else &apos;s stairs .
it &apos;s not that bad .
you &apos;re still married three times , you get a personal date ...
no . my dating numbers are down to rock bottom .
four divorces and ...
<unk> .
ross , don &apos;t be silly . you &apos;re cute and smart .
it &apos;s more important than three divorces .
really ? you &apos;re dating three divorced boyfriends ?
it &apos;s not fair . it &apos;s usually 60 years old .
how young are you ?
yeah , i &apos;m young .
maybe .
you &apos;re the only one who cares about embarrassing things in your head .
i &apos;ll show you .
come here .
what ?
my friend ross is getting a divorce , but you &apos;re not going out with him ?
i &apos;ll go get ross .
i thought you were rachel . where did i get this ?
i have to tell her .
i already told ross and phoebe it was just her .
so everyone knows we &apos;re moving in together . we can &apos;t change our minds .
are you scared ? scared ?
no .
that &apos;s my worst voice . you &apos;re so brave .
rough day .
you think you &apos;re finally being valued , and the boss calls you &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the first four years , everyone calls me <unk> .
it &apos;s true .
i do .
they were having staff meetings , and no one would correct her .
so everyone calls it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the guy from the mailroom is already <unk> .
i still think you &apos;re great . you &apos;re beautiful .
what ?
it &apos;s all yours .
sit .
look , chandler and i are staying here together .
oh , my god . this is amazing .
i &apos;m so happy for you guys .
really ?
that &apos;s nice of you to ask me first .
the three of us are gonna be so happy together .
yeah .
chandler , you can &apos;t shower in the morning . you know you can &apos;t be late .
he &apos;ll notice .
so excited .
to knock on my door .
we &apos;re waiting for you .
once you know something , it &apos;s not that bad .
it wasn &apos;t my fault that the first marriage was kept secret .
second marriage : under oath , a little bit is my fault .
third marriage .
you can &apos;t get married and drink and graffiti is wrong .
what do you think ? who doesn &apos;t want to date him ?
divorce doesn &apos;t matter . i &apos;ll date him , but i can &apos;t .
what about you ? you want to ?
actually , i &apos;m not going out anymore .
i always look at the wrong guy .
whatever .
meg , what about you ?
i don &apos;t care about divorce , but i won &apos;t date him .
he doesn &apos;t normally shed that much light .
it &apos;s just , he &apos;s obviously still in love with this rachel thing .
she said , &quot; he obviously still loves this rachel . &quot;
stop saying that . i mean , yes , rachel &apos;s my best friend .
she did love her , but now she &apos;s just my wife .
phoebe , would you mind ?
okay , i thought you loved her when you married her .
after all we drank , i &apos;d marry joey .
you did a lot worse than joey tribbiani .
i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re wrong . i just don &apos;t wanna get divorced three times .
that &apos;s right . he kept his marriage to her because he loved her .
i must say , meg , good job .
okay , if you want to get over the divorce three times ,
i &apos;m gonna go get a lawyer to cancel .
because i don &apos;t love her at all .
i can &apos;t date you now . you look a little jumpy .
i suddenly find him attractive .
when are we gonna tell rachel the truth ?
almost . i just couldn &apos;t say it . you saw the pain .
i couldn &apos;t bear to be her best friend .
joey &apos;s my best friend , too .
i &apos;m not your best friend ?
you said yourself ...
of course you &apos;re my best friend .
but would you please tell jane ?
okay , well , at least i &apos;m ready .
nice .
it &apos;s not for you . any unhappy ?
i do now .
hi . nice room . bye .
rachel , i have something important to tell you .
you &apos;re pregnant ?
no , but i &apos;m throwing it away .
thought there was some misunderstanding .
i said chandler and i want to live together .
it means only two people .
god , that &apos;s funny . i can &apos;t believe i &apos;m wrong .
no , you don &apos;t know . it &apos;s my fault . i &apos;m sorry .
you can do whatever you need to do to get your house slow .
okay .
okay .
you don &apos;t eat cookies ?
okay .
thanks . you need a tissue ?
where &apos;d you get the cookies ?
i did it .
oh , my god . this is delicious .
whose is this ?
my ...
what about this ?
and mine .
what about the dishwasher ?
when i moved in .
that &apos;s why i feel so guilty .
it &apos;s weird . you &apos;re gone when i get home .
no , joey and rachel are over . we &apos;re done .
&quot; do you want to go to joey and chandler &apos;s ? &quot;
&quot; no , it &apos;s gone . &quot;
i &apos;m just moving across the hall . i can still be the same .
but not in the middle of the night .
we didn &apos;t do it once .
you don &apos;t remember that night . it was late . i wasn &apos;t feeling well .
you said i &apos;d be better tomorrow ?
yeah , i remember .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m gonna miss those days with you , too .
what &apos;s that ?
gross .
i told rachel it was gonna be us , right ? is she okay ?
great . it was an accident .
no tears , no anger or sad .
you &apos;re upset because you didn &apos;t make your best friend cry ?
all i &apos;m asking is , it &apos;s 6 @-@ year @-@ old roommate .
what ? rachel and i are not . are you guys ready ?
i mean , aren &apos;t you happy ?
i don &apos;t deserve some tears ?
when we tell <unk> his eyes are coming out .
i didn &apos;t cry my eyes out .
come on . it &apos;s like a era . it &apos;s never over .
i have to ask , who calls us that ?
you &apos;re married again .
yeah .
this is your second wedding in february .
yes , two years . three times .
i &apos;ve been a divorce lawyer for 23 years , and i haven &apos;t felt this alone .
why didn &apos;t you tell me what happened ?
basically , rachel and i were in vegas . we were drunk ...
i &apos;m sorry , rach . the one you called the wrong name ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t love her .
that &apos;s better .
it &apos;s just a drunk mistake . i &apos;m canceling . i get it .
have you considered therapy ?
i think we should cancel today .
i need some forms .
it &apos;s easy .
there &apos;s got to be a witness that proves you were in trouble .
sure .
and i need you to tell the judge
can &apos;t we not talk to her ? i already told her it was done .
of course you did .
ross , you and rachel were there to cancel the annulment .
what about someone who looks like rachel ?
i &apos;ll consider therapy .
i think it &apos;s time to start sharing something .
okay .
you don &apos;t have to .
you move ? we don &apos;t live together .
okay .
rach , who &apos;s this for ?
i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t think i want too much memories .
what &apos;s that ?
i don &apos;t know .
what about this ? i want you to keep a big plate .
thanks . i love this dish .
so you can remember me .
it &apos;s not dying . i &apos;m just moving out .
or do you see each other every day ?
but a big change can mean it &apos;s over in a time .
are you okay ? you didn &apos;t blink .
i &apos;m fine . i &apos;m just thinking about a time &apos;s over .
okay .
but honestly , i don &apos;t think six years is a time .
a time is a big day .
it &apos;s important to me . maybe it doesn &apos;t matter to you .
what &apos;s wrong with you ? what &apos;s wrong with you ?
why aren &apos;t you more upset ? you wanna split up ?
wouldn &apos;t miss me ?
okay , say it . don &apos;t freak me out .
it &apos;s just a little hard to believe ?
it means you guys . that &apos;s what you do , okay ?
you guys said you were getting married in vegas , and then you &apos;re back .
i &apos;m not sad because i don &apos;t think you &apos;re really gonna live together . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s confirmed . <unk> moved in .
but ...
i know . just hear me out , okay ?
it &apos;s not the spur of the moment in las vegas . we really want to live together .
that &apos;s it ?
really ? yeah , honey .
meaning we can &apos;t live together anymore ?
no .
god , i &apos;m gonna miss you . i &apos;m gonna miss you , too .
it means it &apos;s an era . i know .
bye .
here we go .
did you get the annulment ? no .
i knew it , because you were too busy .
it &apos;s not that . it &apos;s more complicated than i thought ...
it &apos;s about love .
i &apos;m not proud .
i &apos;m gonna go tell her now so i can get the paperwork done .
would i do that if i loved her ?
i &apos;m more sure you love her now .
i don &apos;t feel anything , okay ?
what ?
monica and chandler are really moving in . i have to move out . everything &apos;s changing .
oh , my god . come here . it &apos;s okay . everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
thank you .
you &apos;re welcome .
ross and rachel got married . monica and chandler almost got married .
do you think we should do the same ?
yes , but not now .
really ? when was that ?
okay , first of all , chandler and monica are gonna get married .
but not enough .
wow . i know .
and i &apos;m gonna marry chandler for money .
you &apos;re marrying a couple beautiful kids . great .
but then we abandon them and we get married .
we &apos;re gonna have chandler &apos;s estate , rachel &apos;s baby .
custody is good , because rachel has a drinking problem .
what about ross ? i don &apos;t want to say anything , but ...
we fought , and i killed him .
23 .
damn it .
tony &apos;s in .
damn it . 23 is a birthday you should have bought that number .
five numbers .
he sold six red ones , too .
what a cock .
what &apos;s so exciting ?
tony , <unk> , 23 .
<unk> .
no leverage .
shall we move on ?
keep playing .
okay .
okay , my people .

i &apos;m sure it will .
okay . one more time , 23 .
23 .

eleven .
damn it .
it &apos;s been a long night .
seriously ? vito almost threw me out .
damn it !
stand still .
ten sad people surprised her .
oh !
look at this mess .
hi .
sil .
how are you , sweetie ?
nice to meet you .
sit .
can i get you anything ?
coffee or dessert ?
let you guys talk .
what do you want ?
i appreciate it . let me see you .
you &apos;ve been taking care of vito since he died .
i really don &apos;t know who else to call ...
don &apos;t cry . don &apos;t do this .
what can i do ?
it &apos;s about little vito .
social worker says he &apos;s starting to grow old .
social worker ?
mostly boys .
but he &apos;s so angry .
a lot of bad things about him are <unk> .
they say he hangs the cat in the car &apos;s door .
but it &apos;s completely <unk> .
but you know what happened to vito , and all the racist things .
i think the only way out is to move out .
away from the house and the school kids .
i found it .
i know . it &apos;s a lot of money .
but only $ 100,000 .
you can move to a place no one knows .
my friend lives in maine .
next to <unk> .
there &apos;s an apartment nearby .
it &apos;s a good school .
you always say if there &apos;s anything you can do ,
of course .
did you talk to his uncle ?
who ?
phil ?
phil &apos;s not his uncle . he and i are distant cousins .
before we go further ,
making little vito and your family
before your friends and family split up ,
i should talk to him first . he can &apos;t even talk .
being a father wasn &apos;t easy .
yes .
but maybe it will .
okay , but you &apos;ll think about it , right ?
trust me , i &apos;ll take care of you . he &apos;ll be fine .
now .
little vito &apos;s obviously a handful .
it &apos;s not weird , because the dirt in our family ?
she wants $ 100,000 to change her scenery .
it &apos;s not working .
she should give him a puppy .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
what &apos;s wrong with <unk> ?
because i &apos;m the boss of this family ?
where the hell is phil ?
he killed vito , started causing this trouble .
my most profitable man .
now i &apos;m being double @-@ crossed .
not to mention he &apos;s his uncle .
or a cousin or something ?
not your problem . agreed .
i agree to disagree .
i object to the short kick .
face it . they &apos;re hard to pull .
lost cause .
just like <unk> .
that attack was pushing 30 yards up .
come on ! come on !
watch .
you think that &apos;s gonna happen ?
no , i &apos;ll see . shoot . three points .
no doubt .
they &apos;re gonna chain it &apos;s what they do .
you bet the water buffalo wins ?
no , the pirate has three <unk> and i &apos;m not losing .
let &apos;s go ! let &apos;s go !
the third strike was too close to the goal . he wasn &apos;t holding it .
lose the ball ! pick it up !
strike again .
the ball fell off again .
get down on him !
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
before the big leagues ,
unbelievable .
long live !
listen to that <unk> . it could only win the <unk> .
team bill <unk> .
tampa pirates are <unk> .

no , i &apos;m gonna take a nap .
well done , sweetie .
everybody give me a big hand .

anthony , you always do business .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no . no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no ,
diane came to me .
she wants $ 100,000 to move .
because little vito needs a social worker .
diane told me some things .
like father , like son .
nice metaphor .
but you &apos;re family , right , cousin ?
what are you gonna do ? money problems ?
someone has to pay for it .
i &apos;ll talk to him and set it up .
good .
you two going home together ?
how are you ?
damn prostate . i have to pee all night .
i don &apos;t want it to be my <unk> .
drink ?
i talked to phil about the <unk> center .
your one will be here soon .
christmas .
you should hear what he says tonight .
say something .
really ?
it worries me .
thought we &apos;d finally get along .
you know , considering .
to become an old @-@ fashioned man .
but i think the problem is his brother &apos;s death .
thought your cousin died and cleared it .
how was dinner ?
i &apos;ll go when i &apos;m done .
oh , really ?
i don &apos;t know .
look at my right hand .
paulie , my brother @-@ in @-@ law christopher
what was the first thing they planned ?
oh , my god . they &apos;re all <unk> .
young <unk> ?
what i &apos;m trying to say is ,
it feels good here .
always .
oh !
brought you something .
pull up bald .
actually , i thought it was something else .
want a dvd ?
to be honest , those movies are not welcome .
<unk>
no , i thought that was your $ 200,000 .
oh , yeah .
i know , including all this time ...
you know i forgot .
i &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t forget .
i don &apos;t want to be alone .
no .
tony , come on . it &apos;s okay .
do you have $ 3,000 in here ?
come on .
you &apos;re taking it .
i don &apos;t want you eating cat food anymore .
stop .
i don &apos;t want to give you the interest .
no .
i should &apos;ve given interest .
are you sure you want it ?
oh , my god . are we gonna let this go ?
it &apos;s late .
we &apos;re going home .
you have to pee or do what you want .
i loan people money , and suddenly i &apos;m the bad guy .
why would he borrow your money ?
why ? go to the mat .
no , gambling is a luxury .
and the yacht .
$ <unk> warned him .
it &apos;s definitely not worth selling anymore .
did he listen ?
i took a lot of money from a loan shark .
everybody says , &quot; i forgot . &quot;
who &apos;s gonna forget ? tell him to die .
i don &apos;t like it when you see him before you sleep . look at you .
give me some interest . what &apos;s the big deal ?
three weeks .
you &apos;ve been in business with a lot of jewish people , right ?
my business ?
yeah .
you &apos;re gonna have to give it to them when it comes to money .
according to my experience ,
it &apos;s just a clueless bias , really ?
i have a friend . you haven &apos;t let one of those krugerrands go yet .
he &apos;s already on the shore .
like you said he was a friend .
stop it , old friend .
but it doesn &apos;t stop him because i owe him money .
i need a little cash register .
to the lost money we &apos;ve been talking about lately .
bet ?
you know the stakes aren &apos;t lost .
why not ?
i &apos;ve never been able to do anything
you &apos;ve been talking about it .
there &apos;s always a time to lose .
you &apos;re gonna pretend you &apos;re okay in front of your people .
but what &apos;s the point of losing anyway ?
so you &apos;re taking risks .
what are you after ?
money or pleasure ?
before it &apos;s over ,
there &apos;s something i need to talk about .
you missed a lot of appointments .
i &apos;ve always called ahead , or i &apos;ll pay for it .
that &apos;s not what i meant .
i &apos;m busy .
it &apos;s my fault . too much <unk> .
i haven &apos;t had a panic attack since my uncle got shot .
did you notice ?
got it .
it &apos;s great to know why .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re here ?
panic attacks ?
no .
this is a safe haven .
so that &apos;s the <unk> ?
no , i &apos;m learning so much from here .
you have to decide whether you want to go back to therapy .
but you know , there &apos;s a deal to follow .
or i can &apos;t go back to therapy .
fine . i &apos;ll think about it .
now i know the <unk> wants to be downstairs ,
but i think the gym room is better than the pool .

you wanna call ?
have you ever thought about hurting your mother ?
after everything she &apos;s been through , you still have her ?
it &apos;s her .
she really needs you .
that &apos;s because you already know
you &apos;ve done enough to humiliate yourself .
you should be .
you understand ?
i don &apos;t understand .
god , being a man .
be a man she needs , strong , macho .
i said what i needed to say .

that &apos;s not how it works .
vito was one of us .

i have an idea .
there &apos;s a kid like that in idaho .
idaho ?

i saw it on tv .
frankly , some real stories cost me my tears .
it &apos;s a camp ?
school style .
tony .
they &apos;ll allow it .
he told me about these places .
in utah ,
because those two state laws allow children
it &apos;s just a form of lymphoma .
it &apos;s gonna cost me money , but i &apos;ll help you out .
don &apos;t worry .
moving is not an emotion issue .
maine or somewhere else .
hello ?
yeah .
i know it &apos;s hard to accept ,
but it &apos;s the best way for him .
let &apos;s go .
thanks , tony .

you did a great job with the house .
i built my own building . i should know .
i &apos;m glad to hear your compliment .
i &apos;ve been doing some research lately .
just lost again .
never won .
then your strategy is to raise your arms and keep losing .
when you started chasing that feeling ,
every time it comes to happiness ,
it &apos;s just a matter of time .
this is about money ? it &apos;s not like it &apos;s true .
carm , i swear to you , you &apos;re not gonna do that
i had plans .
it &apos;s not gonna happen to us .
what i hate is you always say it &apos;s gonna be like it .
i &apos;m worried about tony . i &apos;m really worried .
you &apos;ve been shot .
you won &apos;t even buy insurance ? who &apos;s out there ?
stop thinking that .
what &apos;s that ?
there are so many other possibilities ?
the feds will take you anywhere .
and you &apos;re still eating .
pretend it doesn &apos;t fall off the piano with a rope in his head .
stop . i &apos;ve been thinking about it .
the bullet didn &apos;t die .
what are the odds ?
it &apos;s rare .
well , if you think about it ,
i don &apos;t know .
