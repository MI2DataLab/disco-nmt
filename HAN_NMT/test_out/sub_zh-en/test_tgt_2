how &apos;d it go ?
no problems . it &apos;s all done .
thanks , ross .
would you like to go to the cinema ? yeah , why not ?
i &apos;ll get my sweater .
do you want to hear something weird ?
always ready .
i didn &apos;t get the annulment .
what ? we &apos;re still married .
don &apos;t tell rachel . i &apos;ll see you later .
do you got any gum ?
wait ! ross , can i talk to you for a second ?
we &apos;re gonna miss the movie .
there &apos;s a cab . cab !
that &apos;s great . my god , huh ?
get in the car .
we &apos;re gonna walk . it &apos;s right at the angelika .
the angelika ! go ! go !
you didn &apos;t get the annulment ? !
i know .
ross .
i tried , but when i got to my lawyer &apos;s office , all i heard was :
&quot; three divorces ! three divorces ! &quot;
that &apos;s right , in that high voice .
i don &apos;t want my tombstone to read : &quot; ross geller : three divorces . &quot;
don &apos;t worry about that . your tombstone can say whatever you want .
it can say , &quot; ross geller : good at marriage . &quot;
you know ? mine &apos;s gonna say , &quot; phoebe buffay : buried alive . &quot;
all i know is , i can &apos;t have another failed marriage .
so you &apos;re gonna be married to a girl who doesn &apos;t even know about it ?
&quot; woman . &quot; i &apos;m sorry .
i don &apos;t know what to do . please don &apos;t tell rachel .
rachel is one of my best friends .
but being the only one that knows it makes me feel good . okay .
stop the car !
phoebe ? hey , rach !
what is that ? i &apos;m sorry . mix @-@ up .
how &apos;s the movie ? i haven &apos;t seen it .
you &apos;d better hurry . the angelika ! go !
no .
the one where ross hugs rachel
when i move in , can i get a bubble gum machine ?
of course . joey wouldn &apos;t let you buy one ?
no , when it comes to sweets , he &apos;s surprisingly strict .
did you tell him you &apos;re moving out ? no , i keep trying .
i can just say , &quot; joey , i have to ... &quot;
then i lose my nerve and i finish with , &quot; go to the bathroom . &quot;
he may think i &apos;m sick .
i really have to tell rachel
we just gotta get it over with .
next time we see them , we &apos;ll just tell them .
that &apos;s the decision .
that &apos;s how it &apos;ll work now ? you &apos;ll just order me around ?
pretty much .
okay .
monica
you feeling better ?
joey , we have something to tell you .
oh , my god ! you &apos;re pregnant .
no .
no ? no .
joey , here &apos;s the thing .
monica and i have decided to stay together , here . i &apos;m gonna be moving out , man .
i &apos;m really happy for you guys . congratulations . bye .
are you okay ?
i gotta go . i &apos;ve got an acting job .
like you &apos;d believe that .
this sucks !
i &apos;m just moving across the hall . i promise .
the minute monica and i break up , i &apos;m moving right back in .
maybe that &apos;s now .
if you &apos;re gonna move in with him ... i feel it is my responsibility to tell you the truth about him .
he &apos;s a terrible roommate .
he forgets to .... he always , he always ....
who am i kidding ? he &apos;s the best roommate !
phoebe .
oh , look , here &apos;s an article about people who marry people and don &apos;t tell them .
really ?
yeah , i &apos;m reading ross geller magazine .
have you seen rachel ?
no , why ?
i have good news .
you &apos;re pregnant .
no ! chandler and i are moving in together. oh , that &apos;s good !
but if you were pregnant , what would you name it ? hint , phoebe .
what ?
chandler and i are living together .
oh , my god . oh , my little sister and my best friend ... shacking up .
that &apos;s great . that &apos;s great .
guys , i &apos;m glad too . okay , come here .
big day , huh ? people moving in . people getting annulled .
i gotta go find rachel .
if you see her , give her some really bad news , so mine doesn &apos;t seem so bad .
something bad to tell rachel .
what &apos;s her bad news ?
can you just lay off , please ?
my life is so embarrassing . i should just go live under somebody &apos;s stairs .
it &apos;s not that big a deal .
you &apos;ll have been divorced three times . you &apos;ll have a life , you &apos;ll date ..
no , i won &apos;t . i &apos;ll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now .
the only guys below me will be four @-@ divorce guy ... murderer guy
and geologists .
ross , you &apos;re being ridiculous . you are cute and smart and sweet .
this is much more important than three stupid divorces .
have you dated anyone who &apos;s been divorced three times ?
that &apos;s not fair . most guys that have been divorced three times are 60 .
how young you are .
yeah , i am young .
well ...
nobody cares about this except you . this embarrassment thing is all in your head .
i &apos;ll show you .
come here .
what ?
hi . my friend ross is about to be divorced for the third time . but wouldn &apos;t you date him ?
and if you wait right here , i &apos;ll go get ross .
i thought you were rachel . what gave me away ?
i have to tell her .
i &apos;ve told ross and phoebe . she &apos;s the only one left .
it &apos;s official . we &apos;re moving in together . no turning back .
are you scared ? are you ? !
no .
that was my scariest voice . you &apos;re so brave .
that sucks today .
you &apos;re finally making progress at work , then your boss calls you racquel .
listen , for the first four years of my work , everybody called me sha @-@ la @-@ lap
seriously .
i believe you .
it was in the middle of a meeting , so no one wants to correct her .
so everyone &apos;s calling me racquel .
by the end of the day , the mailroom guys were calling me rocky .
well , i still think you &apos;re very , very nice and very pretty .
what ?
all yours , babe .
have a seat .
listen to me , chandler and i ... are going to live together ... here .
oh , my god . that &apos;s great !
i &apos;m so happy for you guys !
really ?
and that was so sweet of you to ask me .
the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together !
yes , we are .
chandler , you &apos;ll have to watch those long showers you take ... because you know racquel can &apos;t be late .
he &apos;ll work on that .
this is so exciting .
come and knock on our door
we &apos;ll wait for you .
once you know the stories , it &apos;s not that bad .
my first marriage : my wife &apos;s hidden her sexuality . it &apos;s not my fault .
my second marriage : i said the wrong name at the altar . it &apos;s a little my fault .
my third marriage :
they shouldn &apos;t let you get married ... when you &apos;re drunk and have writing on your face . it &apos;s nevada &apos;s fault .
so what do you think ? who wouldn &apos;t want to date him ?
the divorces don &apos;t bother me . i &apos;d date him . but not while he &apos;s still married .
and you , wouldn &apos;t you want to date ?
i &apos;m not dating at all anymore .
i was only dating guys that were bad for me .
so i decided that .. good . good . whatever .
how about you , meg ?
well , i don &apos;t care about the divorces , either . but i wouldn &apos;t date him .
normally , he doesn &apos;t sweat this much .
it &apos;s just that he &apos;s obviously still in love with this rachel girl . what ?
she said , &quot; he &apos;s obviously still in love with this rachel girl . &quot;
this is crazy . i mean , yes , rachel is my good friend .
and i have loved her in the past ... but now , she is just my wife .
phoebe , will you help me out here ?
well , i thought you loved her when you married her .
we &apos;re drunk ! i would &apos;ve married joey with that amount of alcohol .
you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani !
i &apos;m sorry , but you &apos;re wrong . i just don &apos;t want to be divorced three times .
now he &apos;s using this three @-@ divorces reason ... because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her .
i must say , well done . bravo , meg .
fine . if this is what you think , forget about ... the whole three @-@ divorce thing .
i &apos;ll go to my lawyer &apos;s office right now and get this marriage annulled .
she means nothing to me . nothing !
okay , now i wouldn &apos;t date you because you seem a little creepy .
i am so attracted to him right now .
when are we going to tell rachel the truth ?
soon . i just couldn &apos;t before . you saw how upset joey got .
i couldn &apos;t do it . she &apos;s my best friend .
joey &apos;s my best friend .
i &apos;m not your best friend ?
you just said ...
of course you &apos;re my best friend .
would you tell rachel ?
okay . at least i &apos;m prepared .
oh , yes .
they &apos;re not for you . are you upset ?
i am now .
hey , roomie . okay , bye .
there &apos;s something important i have to tell you .
you &apos;re pregnant ?
no , but i &apos;m throwing this shirt away .
i think there was a little misunderstanding before .
when i said that chandler and i wanted to live together .
we meant alone together .
oh , my god . that &apos;s funny . i can &apos;t believe i did that .
no , sweetie . you know what ? this is my fault . i wasn &apos;t clear . i &apos;m really sorry .
listen , you take as much time as you need to move out , okay ? there &apos;s absolutely no rush .
okay .
okay .
don &apos;t you want a cookie ?
sure .
thank you . do you need a tissue ?
where did you get these ?
i made them .
oh , my god , they &apos;re so delicious !
okay , whose is this ?
that &apos;s mine .
what about this ? whose is this ?
that &apos;s mine .
okay , whose dishwashing soap is this ?
that was here when we moved in .
oh , i guess it really is concentrated .
it &apos;s gonna be weird when i come home and you &apos;re not here .
no more joey and chan &apos;s . no more j and c &apos;s .
do you want to go to joey and chandler &apos;s ?
i can &apos;t . it &apos;s not there .
i &apos;ll be across the hall . we can still do all the same stuff .
we won &apos;t be able to have those long talks at night ... about our feelings and the future .
not once did we do that .
don &apos;t you remember that night , it was late and i was feeling sick ...
you said i would feel better tomorrow ?
oh , yeah . i remember that .
i don &apos;t know . i &apos;m just gonna miss living with you.yeah , me too , man .
what is that ?
that &apos;s disgusting .
i told rachel that it &apos;s just gonna be the two of us.oh , yeah ? well , how &apos;d she take it ?
really well . surprisingly well .
she didn &apos;t cry . she wasn &apos;t angry or sad .
and you &apos;re upset because you didn &apos;t make your best friend cry ?
all i &apos;m asking for is a little emotion.is that too much to ask after six years ?
what , are rachel and i not as close as you guys ?
i mean , did we not have as much fun ?
don &apos;t i deserve a few tears ?
when we told joey , he cried his eyes out .
i did not cry my eyes out .
come on , it &apos;s like the end of an era.no more j @-@ man and channy &apos;s !
okay , i gotta ask , who calls us that ?
you got married again ?
yes .
so that &apos;s your second marriage in two years ?
yes . second in two years . third , overall .
i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years ... and never have i had so much business from one client .
why don &apos;t you tell me what happened ?
basically , rachel and i were in vegas , and we got drunk .
i &apos;m sorry , is this the same rachel whose name you said ... at the altar in the second marriage ?
yeah , but i don &apos;t love her .
that &apos;s better .
this was just a drunken mistake , and i need to get it annulled . i see .
have you considered therapy ?
i think just the annulment for today .
there are some forms to fill out .
it &apos;s easy .
we &apos;ll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind .
it &apos;s no problem .
we &apos;ll need you and rachel to testify before a judge .
there &apos;s no way to do this without her ? because i kind of already told her it was taken care of
of course you did .
look , you can &apos;t get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there .
what about someone who looks like rachel ?
i will think about the therapy .
so i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff .
okay .
no point in dragging it out .
dragging out the long process of you moving out ... and us not living together anymore .
okay .
what about this ? who gets this ?
i don &apos;t know if i want it because it might be too many memories .
what is that ?
i don &apos;t know .
how about this ? i want you to have the big plate .
wow , monica , thanks . i love this plate .
something to remember me by .
mon , you &apos;re not dying . i &apos;m just moving out .
we &apos;re gonna see each other all the time .
but still , it &apos;s a big change.the end of an era , you might say .
are you okay ? you &apos;re not blinking .
i &apos;m fine . i was thinking about how it &apos;s an end of an era .
oh , all right .
but i gotta say , i don &apos;t think six years counts as an era .
an era is defined as a significant period of time .
it was significant for me . maybe it wasn &apos;t significant to you !
@-@ what is the matter with you ?  @-@ what is the matter with you ? !
why aren &apos;t you more upset ? aren &apos;t you gonna be sad that we &apos;re not living together ?
aren &apos;t you gonna miss me at all ?
monica , all right . but don &apos;t get mad at me .
it &apos;s just a little hard to believe . what &apos;s hard to believe ?
i mean , it &apos;s you guys . you do this kind of stuff , you know ?
you were gonna get married in vegas , and then you backed out .
i &apos;m not upset because i don &apos;t see you going through with it . i &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s going to happen . chandler will move in here .
but i ...
i know , just let me finish , okay ?
this isn &apos;t something that we just impulsively decided to do in vegas.this is something that we both really want .
and it is going to happen . it is ?
really ? yeah , sweetie .
you mean , we &apos;re not gonna live together anymore ?
no .
oh , my god . i &apos;m gonna miss you so much . i &apos;m gonna miss you .
i mean , it &apos;s the end of an era ! i know !
okay , bye .
oh , no .
so did you get the annulment ?  @-@ i couldn &apos;t .
i knew it . because you love rachel .
it &apos;s not that . annulments are more complicated ..
it &apos;s complicated because of the love .
i do not love rachel .
i &apos;m telling her about the whole thing ... so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible .
would i do that if i loved her ?
i &apos;ve never been more convinced of your love for her .
i do not have feelings for rachel , okay ?
oh , what &apos;s wrong ?
monica and chandler are moving in here ... and i have to move out and everything is changing .
oh , my god , come here , come here . it &apos;s okay.everything &apos;s gonna be okay .
thank you .
of course .
so ross and rachel got married . monica and chandler almost got married .
you think we should hook up ?
oh , we do . but not just yet .
really ? well , when ?
well , first chandler and monica will get married ... and be filthy rich , by the way .
but it won &apos;t work out .
wow . i know .
then i &apos;ll marry chandler for the money .
and you &apos;ll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids . great .
but then we ditch them and we get married .
we &apos;ll have chandler &apos;s money and rachel &apos;s kids .
getting custody will be easy because of rachel &apos;s drinking problem .
what about ross ? i don &apos;t want to go into the whole thing . but
we have words and i kill him .
23 , red and odd .
damn it !
fucking nailed it , tony !
23 . sophia &apos;s birthday . i should have had that .
got it like five ways there .
six . he &apos;s on red too .
you cocksucking motherfucker .
what happened ?
tone hit one straight up .
66 @-@ 1.0 going out .
don &apos;t spill those .
take it or play it ?
keep playing .
okay .
okay , my man .
23 and all around .
really ?
you gotta ride that .
one more time .
23 , come on .
do it again !
23 , come on .
23
23 . come on , bounce .
do it again !
eleven .
damn it !
douchebags are taking it all back tonight .
what the fuck , vito ? you almost hit me .
timber , motherfucker .
stop right there !
ten to one odds . poor boy &apos;s delight and she fucking comes in .
oh !
look at this mezza @-@ mort .
hey .
sil .
how are you , honey ?
nice to meet you .
sit down .
can i get you something ?
coffee or dessert ?
i &apos;ll let you two talk .
so ?
i really appreciate you letting me see you .
and you &apos;ve been so decent about everything since vito &apos;s death .
i just don &apos;t know who else ...
all right , all right . come on , marie .
what can i do ?
it &apos;s little v .
the social worker says he &apos;s just acting out .
social worker ?
boy stuff mostly ,
but he is so angry .
although some of what he &apos;s being accused of is just persecution .
they claim that he hung the petruzzos &apos; cat on their garage door ,
but it &apos;s totally unfounded .
well , you know , in a way it &apos;s to be expected , with vito passing and all that that entrailed .
i think the only solution is to move away
from that house and the kids at school .
i figured it out ,
and i know it &apos;s a lot ,
but for 100,000 .
we could be someplace where no one knows him or what happened .
my friend cheryl lives in orono , maine , by the university .
by the university .
and there &apos;s this two @-@ storey cape ,
with solid schools .
you always said if there &apos;s anything you could do ...
of course .
have you talked to his uncle ?
who ?
phil !
phil &apos;s not his uncle . him and i are second cousins .
before we get too drastic here
and uproot little vito and all of you
from your friends and your family ,
i should talk to him . he &apos;s impossible to talk to .
it &apos;s not easy to substitute for a father .
i know .
but maybe i can fill in here .
ok , but you &apos;ll think about it ?
trust me , i &apos;m gonna take care of you and he &apos;s gonna be fine .
well ,
apparently vito junior &apos;s a whack job .
no surprise there . family history ?
she wants $ 100,000 for a change of scenery .
that never works .
she should get him a dog .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
the point is , how the fuck is this my problem ?
because i &apos;m the boss of the family ?
where the fuck is phil leotardo ?
he created the situation by clipping vito to begin with .
my best fucking earner .
now second time around i &apos;m getting my pocket picked .
not to mention he &apos;s his uncle
or cousin or whatever the fuck .
not your problem . i agree .
i agree , jim .
i argued against the on @-@ side kick .
let us face it , they rarely work .
the overworked bucs d are falling apart
as the bills ,
with that play , are inside the 30 and loaded for goal .
let us go . come on .
just watch .
@-@  bills will get another seven .  @-@  you think ?
nah , i say a quick field goal wins it .
absolutely .
they &apos;ll choke . that &apos;s what they do .
you got buffalo , right , t ?
line is three . i &apos;ll settle for a push .
buffalo ! fucking go for it !
third and two , the snap . losman &apos;s back , he hands it off .
fumble !
ball &apos;s ... buffalo recovers .
fumble again .
get him ! come on !
oh , no . oh , boy . get him !
buffalo scores as time expires .
un @-@ fucking @-@ believable .
buffalo ! fucking a !
listen to this fucking guy . probably won $ 35 down there .
final score , buffalo 28 ,
tampa bay 24 .
skip , another beer ?
no , i &apos;ll take a nap .
beautiful , sweetheart .
nancy sinatra , everybody .
congratulations , philly .
thank you .
we were gonna go the festival route
but we found a guy who wants to distribute it himself ,
so we &apos;ll see .
it &apos;s a good little movie .
jesus christ , it &apos;s 11 : 30 .
ready to call it ?
an hour ago .
i saw him bring dean and jerry back together .
i was there at the telethon .
i cried .
you leaving already ?
yeah , it &apos;s late .
got a long hike to jersey from here .
sure , i used to drive it myself .
no more , though .
i &apos;ll be right back .
congratulations again .
listen , i gotta bring this up .
a favour already ?
excuse me ?
anthony , you always have business on your mind .
take a night , smell the cognac .
marie spatafore came to see me .
she wants $ 100,000 to relocate
on account of vito junior already has his own social worker .
patty told me there was doings .
the turd doesn &apos;t fall far from the faggot &apos;s ass .
that &apos;s beautifully put ,
but you &apos;re family , right ? cousins ?
what can you do ? throw money at the problem ?
well , somebody &apos;s gonna .
i &apos;ll talk to the kid , set him right .
good .
you two going home together ?
how the fuck are you ?
fucking prostate keep me pissing all night .
i wouldn &apos;t wish it on my worst enemy .
a drink ?
i talked to phil about the split on the mrl centres .
your cut is on the way .
christmas .
you should have heard him tonight .
comments , smug .
really ?
worries me .
i thought we were getting along pretty good finally ,
you know , considering .
could be the hubris , making boss .
i think it &apos;s what went down with his brother billy .
i thought all that got buried with your cousin .
how was the dinner ?
i left right after .
yeah ?
i don &apos;t know .
i look at my key guys ,
paulie , christopher , my brother @-@ in @-@ law ,
what &apos;s number one on their agenda ?
they &apos;re all fucking murderers , for christ &apos;s sake .
lonely at the top , boychik ?
what i &apos;m trying to say is ...
it &apos;s nice being here .
always is .
oh .
i brought you something .
cover up that dome .
actually , i was expecting something else .
what , the fucking dvd ?
it &apos;s a very unflattering portrait
of ltalian @-@ americans .
no , i was thinking maybe some of that 200,000 i loaned you ?
oh , jesus . yeah , that &apos;s right .
i know it &apos;s covered . it &apos;s just after a while ...
you know , i lost track .
i &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t .
i don &apos;t wanna be a stickler .
no .
anthony , come on . no , it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s ok .
i got about three grand here . point and a half good ?
no , come on , fuck this .
you gotta have it .
i don &apos;t want you eating cat food .
stop it .
i don &apos;t gotta have it . i don &apos;t want a vig from you .
no , come on .
i should have been on it .
you sure ?
jesus christ , are we good or what ?
well , it &apos;s late .
i should be getting back .
you should get back to pissing , or whatever you ...
i lend the guy money . suddenly i &apos;m the schmuck .
why would he borrow your money ?
why ? to cover his nut .
between his gambling and the lifestyle
and that boat ...
3.2 million . i warned him .
it has absolutely no resale value whatsoever .
does he listen ?
i &apos;ve lent lots of money .
once the chiselling starts , &quot; i forgot . &quot;
who forgets ? fuck him .
this is why i don &apos;t like you seeing him before bed . you &apos;re all upset .
makes a big show of giving me a vig .
$ 3,000 a week .
you got a lot of jews in your business , right ?
my business ?
yes , this .
you gotta hand it to them , when it comes to money ...
in my experience ,
that &apos;s nothing more than an ugly stereotype . really ?
i got a friend , you tie a krugerrand to a fishing line , you &apos;re gonna land him .
right up on the dock by him .
doesn &apos;t sound like you think of him as a friend .
come on . we go way back .
but that didn &apos;t stop him from busting my balls because i owe him some money .
anyway , i needed a little bridge loan
to cover some of my gambling losses .
still ?
you know , good money after bad .
why not just stop ?
big part of my life .
you &apos;ve been talking about it a lot .
well , you lose sometimes .
you gotta act like it hurts a little more than it does , for your guys .
but if you &apos;re gonna lose , what &apos;s the point ?
so you need the risk .
what are you chasing ?
money or a high from winning ?
before we end ,
there &apos;s something i need to bring up .
you miss a lot of appointments .
i always give you the required notice or i pay for the hour .
that &apos;s not my point .
well , i &apos;m busy .
it &apos;s my fault . i &apos;ve condoned it for a long time .
i haven &apos;t had a panic attack since my uncle shot me .
did you notice that ?
yes .
well , it must be nice to know everything .
is that the only reason why you &apos;re here ?
the panic attacks ?
no .
this is an ... oasis in my week .
so this is vacation ?
no , i benefit in many ways .
decide if you wanna keep coming ,
but you know there are protocols that you have to be followed
or i won &apos;t be able to continue .
ok , i will .
now , i know brian wants the media room downstairs ,
but i think it &apos;s better if the gym has access to the pool .
that &apos;s the inspector .
i told the guy to run cable for computers
but i can &apos;t promise it &apos;s not already obsolete .
hi . how are you ? ted yacanelli , yacanelli home lnspections .
come in . these are our cousins , hugh and carmela .
they &apos;re also the builders .
great .
do you wanna start over here ?
yeah .
i didn &apos;t come out here just to buy you a couple of sundaes .
it &apos;s a silo .
i don &apos;t give a fuck what it is .
what the hell &apos;s wrong with you ?
you look like a puerto rican whore . you make me sick .
so ? what &apos;s it gotta do with you ?
listen , pally , you need to be rebellious .
i raised kids . i get it .
you &apos;re good .
you want a smack too ?
you ever think what this is doing to your mother ,
what she &apos;s been through , how you &apos;re upsetting her ?
she &apos;s just embarrassed .
she cries for you .
i &apos;m gonna say this because you &apos;re old enough to understand .
your family &apos;s had enough shame .
you should set things right .
you understand me ?

you know , just a piece of my half .
you &apos;re rich , tony . use some of those bundles to cover it .
that money &apos;s for emergencies only , carm .
my other money &apos;s tied up in asset allocation .

windfall cash .
this is the kind of shit you play with .
i &apos;m telling you , we are golden here .

did you see that pissy attitude ?
come all the way out here to pick him up ,
not to mention give him his fucking vig in person .

what &apos;s he gonna do about it ?
to not pay my debts ? head of the family ?
how &apos;s that gonna look ?
who &apos;s gonna know ?
it &apos;s like eddie valentine .
the guy from philly ?
with the polio leg and the built @-@ up shoe ?
no , from the twilight zone .
you must have seen that one .
you should start sucking cock instead of watching tv land
because vito brought in three times what you do on construction .
yeah .
and i didn &apos;t have this fucking problem .
god fucking damn it !
what ?
that &apos;s good , right ?
no . i only bet $ 100,000 .
but you won .  what did i say ?
what did i tell you ? it &apos;s a sure thing .
you talk about this crap like it &apos;s science .
i lost a lot of money .
you didn &apos;t lose .
we could have turned your bullshit into a million dollars .
my &quot; bullshit &quot; ?
that spec house was my investment .
for my future .
here we go .
ginny sack had to move in with her daughter .
again with ginny sack .
john provided . she &apos;s a fucking hysteric .
did you ever think i might know what i &apos;m doing ?
you and the furniture and the cars .
you would have spent everything i made if i let you .
the next time you win i &apos;ll take a cut ,
and i &apos;ll roll the fucking dice .
you already took your cut , from the bird feeder .
and don &apos;t fucking deny it again .
what ? 40 grand in the stock market ?
i &apos;d ask for my piece , but there &apos;s nothing .
that spec house ? i made the down payment .
i bought the materials .
i leaned on that building inspector when you had your thumb up your ass .
so stop talking about your money !
let go of me , you piece of shit !
you &apos;re a shitty businesswoman who built a piece @-@ of @-@ shit house
that &apos;s gonna cave in and kill that fucking unborn baby any day .
now you can &apos;t sleep .
go fuck yourself !
when i &apos;m gone you can live in a dumpster for all i care .

he got expelled because he took a shit in the shower in gym class .
that sick little fuck .
you should see him .
the makeup .
and without school , marie says he &apos;s shut in his room all day .
probably thinking about how to pull a columbine .
but the little girl ...
francesca .
her dad &apos;s gone , her brother &apos;s a psycho ,
her mother &apos;s a basket case . she &apos;s nine years old .
what the fuck did she ever do ?
tragedy .
like a pebble in a lake . even the fish feel it .
it &apos;s not right .
vito was one of us .
so he sucked a cock . prior to that , he was our friend .
can &apos;t just cut his family loose .
that piece of shit , phil , he &apos;s never gonna pony up .
i tell you what , i will never forget that he didn &apos;t come through here .

and if i win , marie spatafore gets a free ride and then some .
yeah , good for you .
because carlo said the kid went into the litter box and ate some cat shit .
no , he took a shit , in the shower .
glad we got that straight .
hell of a finish .
injuries , even tragedy , they are unable to stop miami .
final score , miami 21 , philadelphia 7 .
when you get support like that ,
it makes all the difference .
hey , marie . how you holding up ?
he snuck out again last night .
like i told you , i want to help you .
god bless you , tony . i don &apos;t know what else to do .
well , i do .
there &apos;s this camp in ldaho and they handle kids like him .
idaho ?
you know , like tough love ? you know ?
i saw it on tv ,
and honestly , i was moved to tears by some of the success stories .
it &apos;s a camp ?
a school camp .
tony .
they allow corporal punishment .
his guidance counsellor told me about those places ,
and they &apos;re in utah and ldaho
because state law allows them to strike the kids .
that &apos;s just for the deterrent factor .
it &apos;s 18 grand but i &apos;m gonna take care of it for you ,
don &apos;t worry about it .
there &apos;s no geographical solution to an emotional problem , marie .
maine , wherever .
marie ?
yeah ?
i know it &apos;s hard ,
but it &apos;s the best thing for him .
ok ?
thanks , tony .

mom !
i &apos;m sorry , honey .

oh , my god .
this one coming down to the buzzer .
stackhouse draining a three @-@ pointer as time ran out ,
ieading dallas to a 109 to 108 victory over the visiting san antonio spurs .
so what ? we &apos;re not speaking now ?
listen to me , come here .
what ?
sit down .
come on .
i &apos;m sorry .
i really am .
you did real good with that house .
and i should know . i &apos;m in construction .
i &apos;m glad to hear you approve .
i &apos;ve been losing .
i &apos;m fucking losing right now .
a real shitty streak .
so your solution is to risk more and make things even worse ?
you start chasing it .
and every time you get your hands around it
you fall further backwards
so this is about money ? because it didn &apos;t feel like it .
carm , i swear to you , you &apos;re not gonna be like ginny .
i &apos;ve been real good about that
and it &apos;s not gonna happen to us .
i hate that you &apos;re going around acting all the time like it will .
i worry , tony . i do .
you already got shot .
now you won &apos;t go down and get the paper . who is out there ?
come on ...
what is it ?
what are the million other possibilities ?
the fbl waiting to take you away ?
you eat and you play ,
and you pretend there &apos;s not a giant piano hanging by a rope over the top of your head every minute of every day .
that &apos;s it . i &apos;ve been thinking about this .
now , i survived a fucking gunshot wound .
what are the odds on that ?
terrible .
so if you think about it ,
i &apos;m up .
what ?
way up .
that was me , not a fireboat .
10 : 30 .
10 : 30 . what would you like for breakfast ?
renata ?
renata ?
oh , god , no .
wait . wait . renata .
renata .
renata
911 . what &apos;s the emergency ?
